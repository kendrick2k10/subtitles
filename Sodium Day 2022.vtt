3
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.240
I really don't know about this. bro.

4
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.800
What are we doing?

5
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.400
Mr. Dorsey only cut a tiny piece
and it blew a hole in the ceiling.

6
00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.640
A tiny. tiny piece.
bro. like a sunflower seed.

7
00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.040
What are we doing?

8
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.600
We're planting sunflower seeds

9
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.080
and we're going to grow
a giant sunflower tree.

10
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.560
'Na'.

11
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.320
What's that? 'Na'?

12
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.440
-It's Sodium.
-Sodium?

13
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.040
The symbol for Sodium is N - A
from the German word 'Natrium'.

14
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.440
Natrium?

15
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.080
Take some Natrium
and shove it up your butt.

16
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.320
Wait Blabla man. Duiwel
listen here. this is not a good idea. bro.

17
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.479
What are we doing?

18
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:10.919
Well. Blabla.

19
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.840
Natrium aka Sodium
is a very. very volatile metal.

20
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.720
See here. it's kept in oil

21
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.400
because if it touches water.

22
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.000
even a tiny bit of water. it's most likely
to cause a massive explosion.

23
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.520
Hey. isn't that the stuff
that Dorsey put in the water last week?

24
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.720
It blew up like a motherfucker
the whole roof was fucked!

25
00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.120
-The ceiling.
-What?

26
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.920
The ceiling. Not the roof.

27
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.880
-It was on top by the roof.
-It doesn't matter. bro.

28
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.240
Duiwel. listen here.
This is not a good idea.

29
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.000
Duiwel are you mad. bro?

30
00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.560
That's too much.
Put it back!

31
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.000
Yesterday my old man met up
with one of his old school friends.

32
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.880
All they could fucking talk about
was the shit they did

33
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.400
when they were on fucking school.

34
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.120
Two fucking old fat alcoholic has-beens.

35
00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.760
And they haven't done
a single thing worth talking about

36
00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.680
since their fucking high school days.

37
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.560
To be honest.

38
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.360
I'd rather get blown to shit
than end up like they did.

39
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.200
But if I don't die.

40
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.000
I'd better have more exciting stories
than the shit they had.

41
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.240
See?

42
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.160
Blown up. Or a good story.

43
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.440
It's a win-win situation.

44
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.960
Heads up!

45
00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.080
Shit!

46
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.680
-Hey. I'm going to go get it. man.
-Wait Blabla.

47
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.000
Everyone can just take the Natrium
and shove it in their butts.

48
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.880
Fuck!

49
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.080
Fuck… fuck… fuck.

50
00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.280
Fuck!

51
00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.920
Guys. let's get the fuck out of here.

52
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.280
Come Duiwel.

53
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.120
Heads up. guys!

54
00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.280
Shit.

55
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.600
What the hell
is going on here boys?

56
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.200
Sir. we were standing
there down by our class

57
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.160
and we heard a massive Kaboom. Sir.

58
00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:08.680
So we came running to see.

59
00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.920
Sir. do you think it's terrorism. Sir?

60
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:19.920
Get back to your classes. boys!

61
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Yes. Sir.

62
00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.320
Sir. maybe it's from a sewerage pipe
running under the field

63
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.880
and someone flushed a cigarette.

64
00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.480
It's like methane. Sir.
Like in Physics.

65
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.600
See you. Sir.
That was really hectic. bro.

66
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.200
Leave me!

67
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.080
Condom…

68
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.480
condom…

69
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:51.640
condom.

70
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.400
Fuck.

71
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.040
Not again.

72
00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.880
Are you going to
finish school early today?

73
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.000
Yes. I'll finish at like two.

74
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.760
A pretty girl like you
shouldn't be in school anymore.

75
00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.840
So what do you want me to do then?

76
00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.040
Be my wife.

77
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.560
What the fuck?

78
00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:20.440
We have to record this day.
like a historical record.

79
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.200
like the Rosetta Stone.

80
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.920
Sodium Day. Yeah…

81
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.080
This day will go down in memory.

82
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.679
Start of the day. Prefect.

83
00:08:37.559 --> 00:08:41.400
Right everybody! Line up nice. nice now.
Come on.

84
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:46.720
Hey. you two. don't slack.
Don't dilly-dally. okay?

85
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.280
What are we going to do with him?

86
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.600
Bro. anything we do to him
will just make him worse.

87
00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:02.240
Thank you. everyone.
Keep the line straight now.

88
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.560
Come. come. come…

89
00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:09.560
Jerome. where's Simone?

90
00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.520
I don't know.
She wasn't at the terminus this morning.

91
00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.520
-Maybe she's sick.
-She's never sick.

92
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.640
-I know.
-Did you message her?

93
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.880
I did message her
but she didn't read it yet.

94
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.920
But I'm going to try to call her later.

95
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.560
Get to class!

96
00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:30.000
Okay. everyone.
are you ready to go inside?

97
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.120
Looking a bit thin in the water today.

98
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.680
Keep the lines straight.
Thank you. Thank you.

99
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.440
Blabla.
aren't you supposed to check latecomers?

100
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.320
Yes. Prefect.

101
00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.960
Okay.
Everyone inside.

102
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.720
Hey. why aren't you in line?

103
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.040
-Inside. please.
-See here.

104
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.400
Prefect.

105
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:51.320
-Show some respect. man.
-Everyone. can you please go inside?

106
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.640
Blabla!

107
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.320
Inside. please!

108
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.760
Let's go!

109
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.200
Now you have to listen to me
very carefully now.

110
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.200
Tomorrow morning.
this can't happen again.

111
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.320
Otherwise.

112
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.840
this would be your new home.

113
00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.200
Go to class.

114
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.440
Malusi. very irresponsible behavior
for a matric student.

115
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.800
That would be a latecomers
detention for you.

116
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:12.280
You see here? Prefect.
Show some respect. man.

117
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.920
You know what. Blabla?
You need to shut the fuck up.

118
00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:17.880
Malusi.

119
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.200
Malusi.

120
00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:25.960
Hey dude…

121
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:31.440
What is that blonde nappy head's name?

122
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.040
-That's Malusi.
-From which class?

123
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.520
Twelve Y. at the back.
Why?

124
00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.320
It's nothing. Don't worry.

125
00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.600
Latecomers detention.

126
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.320
Nice and full. yeah.
Nice and full.

127
00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.160
Okay. class.

128
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.360
Settle down. 12Y. settle down.

129
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.880
Settle. please!

130
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.200
Let's do the register.

131
00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.440
-Cindy?
-Not here. Mrs.

132
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.520
Typical. Sylvia?

133
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.240
She's here. Mrs.

134
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.240
Thank you. Bukelwa?

135
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.360
No. Mrs.

136
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.960
-Jerome?
-Yes. Mrs.

137
00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:41.520
-Thandisizwe?
-Not here. Mrs.

138
00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:44.880
-Keegan?
-Mark me absent. Mrs.

139
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.480
I don't want to be here.

140
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.760
Present.

141
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.760
Noluthando?

142
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.800
Here. Mrs.

143
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.800
Themb's?

144
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.680
-What are you doing here?
-I'm the security. dude.

145
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.640
Yeah…
Number one security.

146
00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.600
-Wait. how old are you. 16?
-I'm 15. dude.

147
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.160
But look here… fake I.D.
21 years old!

148
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.560
-And school?
-Who needs school bro?

149
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.480
Do you know how much
I'm earning here?

150
00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.760
Two thousand. eight hundred rand.

151
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.240
-That's nothing.
-Nothing?

152
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.000
I can buy two pairs of Nikes
every month.

153
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.200
And food?

154
00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.200
At least I have under 150
to buy half a loaf every day.

155
00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:48.440
-You're crazy.
-Hold up.

156
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:53.360
Lend me your smartphone.
I want to watch some training videos.

157
00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.440
-You break. you buy. okay?
-Relax. dude.

158
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:07.440
And hey. don't use my data. bro.

159
00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:12.000
Two thousand. eight hundred rand.
I'll buy my own data. man.

160
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.160
What the hell is going on here?

161
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.480
You…

162
00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:20.000
get to your class.

163
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.360
And you.
you don't talk to the students.

164
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:29.240
You do your work
or else I'll have you replaced.

165
00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.960
Where must you be?

166
00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:34.600
The gate. Sir.

167
00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.120
Well?

168
00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.560
Excuse me. Sir.
can I be of any assistance?

169
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:54.400
Yes.

170
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:57.080
-Prefect. Sir.
-Yes.

171
00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.040
I'm supposed to be substituting.

172
00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:02.680
Hey you. take this guy to reception.

173
00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.920
Yes…

174
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.760
I would like for you to fill
in your name in there and there. Sir.

175
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.920
-Okay.
-And come with me.

176
00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.760
You're late. Malusi.

177
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.200
-Trains. Mrs.
-Yeah. trains.

178
00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:33.440
Phone them. Mrs.
The trains are delaying again.

179
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:35.440
See anyone who takes a train here?

180
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.520
Noluthando is here on time.

181
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:40.520
-Why?
-I take the 5:30 a.m.. Mrs.

182
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.240
Mrs.. I have to take
my sister to creche

183
00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.280
and my brother
to primary school first.

184
00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.880
Can I please sit down?

185
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.680
Jerome. where's Simone?

186
00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.960
I don't know. Mrs.

187
00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.520
She wasn't at
the terminus this morning.

188
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.960
It's not like her.

189
00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.360
She's never missed a single day of school.

190
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.840
Hey Simone. where are you?

191
00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.480
Everyone is looking for you.

192
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.000
It's complicated.
But don't worry. okay?

193
00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:17.120
But you're not even answering your phone.
What's going on?

194
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.080
Jerome.

195
00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:23.240
You're always so worried about me
and it's very sweet.

196
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.800
But don't worry. okay?

197
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.680
Don't worry.

198
00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:41.040
See everyone.
the Prefect returns from his duty.

199
00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.320
Why. Mrs.?
Why did you make him a prefect?

200
00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.080
You know we don't have
an official prefect system.

201
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.480
I just had to get
him out of my hair

202
00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.400
in the morning
during Registration Period.

203
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:51.920
Don't hate the player.
hate the game.

204
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.280
Mrs.. what timetable is it today?

205
00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.960
We're switching to the "B" timetable.
So it's day one of the "B" timetable.

206
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:05.839
Why are we switching
to the "B" timetable?

207
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:07.880
To accommodate
the public holidays next week.

208
00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.640
Why didn't we
just keep the same timetable?

209
00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:11.680
Timetable swaps
have nothing to do with me.

210
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.760
-Ask Mr. Dorsey.
-"A" timetable.

211
00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:16.520
"B" timetable. Day one. Day four.

212
00:17:16.599 --> 00:17:19.079
Heaven forbid
we get into any kind of routine.

213
00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.800
-It's double Maths.
-Yes! Double free.

214
00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.640
Mrs. when are we getting a new teacher?

215
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:26.720
It's six weeks to the finals.
It's too late.

216
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.560
-Just enjoy the free period.
-Mrs. when?

217
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.080
-Ask Mr. Dorsey.
-Dorsey doesn't give a shit.

218
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.280
Hey. Keegan.

219
00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:33.640
-Watch your language.
-Expel me.

220
00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.760
It's six weeks before the finals.

221
00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.160
Don't push me. boy.

222
00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.000
Settle down 12Y!

223
00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.360
I don't know. Mrs.

224
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.480
-Twelve Y…
-I don't know. Mrs.

225
00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.400
Everyone. this is Mr…

226
00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.560
Smith.

227
00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:56.800
John Smith.

228
00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:59.880
Yes. that's… that's actually my name.

229
00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.200
Why wouldn't it be your name?

230
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.240
-Duiwel. don't start.
-No. no. it's fine.

231
00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.600
It's because it's like
the most common name. you know.

232
00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.840
No. it's not.

233
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:10.200
-Wakes is the most common name.
-No man. it's Fakes.

234
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.720
-Nolu?
-It's Xola.

235
00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:14.760
-Sir. we don't know any John Smiths.
-Guys. stop messing around now.

236
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.440
Misbehave and I'll be dealing with you.

237
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:20.160
No messing about.
Duiwel…

238
00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.640
Yes. Mrs.

239
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.440
-Blabla.
-What. Mrs?

240
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.080
Yes. Mrs. No messing around.

241
00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:29.800
Nolu. come get me
if there are any hassles.

242
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:31.760
-Okay.
-Just send her to me. okay?

243
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.440
I'm sure it'll be fine.

244
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.040
Jama. why are you late?

245
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:42.080
Trains. Mrs. You can call them.

246
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.840
Just go sit down.

247
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.880
Okay. so you should be fine.

248
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.560
-You're late.
-Trains. Ma'am.

249
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.120
Who's this?

250
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.600
-Go sit.
-It's not my fault that I'm late.

251
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:03.680
Hey there. my baby.

252
00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.000
Okay… 12Y…

253
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:09.240
I don't know. sir.

254
00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.160
Why does he always say that?

255
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.840
We don't know. sir.
Just ignore him.

256
00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:16.920
Okay. well.
I've been given this worksheet to…

257
00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.800
Train number 0745
has been canceled.

258
00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:27.360
-Train number 2526…
-Has been canceled.

259
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.920
-Train number 3572…
-Has been canceled.

260
00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.840
-Train number 0522?
-Has been canceled.

261
00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.320
No. that one is one hour delay.

262
00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:42.800
-Metrorail apologizes…
-For the inconvenience caused.

263
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.400
Sir. no one from Khayelitsha
is coming in today.

264
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.040
The trains are just sitting there
on the line filled with people.

265
00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:48.840
They can't get off.

266
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.200
-Who are you. Sir?
-It's our new Maths teacher.

267
00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.640
John Smith.
And you are?

268
00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.760
I'm X.

269
00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.160
X is my first name. my middle name is X.
My surname is X.

270
00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.440
Wow.
Triple-X.

271
00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.680
X-rated. liberated.
dedicated. mentally activated.

272
00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.800
-And retardated.
-You get lost.

273
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.480
-And at the party. you were gated.
-Shut up. man.

274
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.680
Don't use your darkie language
here with me. okay?

275
00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:21.520
That's Thandisizwe. Sir.

276
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.880
-You our new Maths teacher. Sir?
-I'm just substituting for today.

277
00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.240
What the hell. man?

278
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.240
We keep getting
someone for one day…

279
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.760
two days… This is bullshit.
The exams are next month.

280
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.920
Well. I'm not really
a Maths teacher. I mean.

281
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.040
I did pass Maths in high school

282
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.520
but I'm an English
and Life Orientation teacher.

283
00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.640
Why did I sit on the train for two hours?

284
00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.440
Sorry. Sir.

285
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:51.840
Okay. well…

286
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.320
You can pass these out and then.

287
00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.080
you guys. whenever you're ready.
you can just begin

288
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.280
and if you have any problems. let me know
and I'll see if I can help you.

289
00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:15.200
Mommy. are you home?

290
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:09.720
Sir. we can't do question number one.
We haven't done this section.

291
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.840
Okay then…

292
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.920
Just do question two.
It's a different section.

293
00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.880
We haven't done
that section either. Sir.

294
00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:22.440
Sorry. Sir!

295
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.960
Okay. well then. maybe…

296
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.600
Sir. we didn't cover question
three and question four either. Sir.

297
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.640
We can't do any
of these worksheets. Sir.

298
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.320
Can you teach us a section?

299
00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:41.080
Okay. well…

300
00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:43.080
How about this?

301
00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:46.160
Everyone take a few minutes
and write down what you understand

302
00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:48.160
and then I'll see
what I can help you with.

303
00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.600
Jeez.

304
00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.720
-What are you doing?
-Sir. just leave her. You don't want to--

305
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.800
No. I think you should sit down.

306
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.520
Sir. don't do that.
She's going to trip.

307
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.400
Please sit down.
What the hell?

308
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.080
What's wrong with her?

309
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.880
-She's always been like that. Sir.
-You must just leave her next time.

310
00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:27.520
Sorry. sir.

311
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:45.320
Yo. bro

312
00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.600
you won't believe this…

313
00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.720
What is it?

314
00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.680
I was outside Cindy's place
this morning…

315
00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.480
Yeah?

316
00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.200
And a Nigger walks out of her place.

317
00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:02.960
-My Cindy's place?
-Yes. your Cindy's place.

318
00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.400
So what did you do?

319
00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.040
I followed that fucker.

320
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.280
He goes to her school.

321
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.040
John Shelby High.

322
00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:12.960
-And then?
-I got his name.

323
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.520
Malusi. class 12Y.

324
00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:21.480
I'm going to kill that motherfucker.

325
00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.040
Malusi…

326
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.680
Malusi…

327
00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.920
Malusi…

328
00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:43.680
Hey. come on Malusi!

329
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:47.000
So what are you going to buy me?

330
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.080
For my birthday next week?

331
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.680
-What do you want me to get?
-You know what I want.

332
00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.000
Okay.
How about we eat out?

333
00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.280
How about Spur?

334
00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:05.760
You know that I like jewelry.

335
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.360
Sorry. Sir.

336
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.760
-Why do they keep doing that?
-Just ignore it. Sir.

337
00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:43.520
You know what?
It's impossible to concentrate.

338
00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:47.720
-Are these the class keys?
-This guy doesn't listen. hey?

339
00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:10.560
No.

340
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.520
Stop bloody disturbing us!

341
00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:18.160
Now you see why
we don't have a Maths teacher. Sir.

342
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.000
All the new teachers
have a problem

343
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.240
with when to ignore
and when to respond.

344
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.040
When told and when to fold. Sir.

345
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.160
-You play Poker. sir?
-No. I don't.

346
00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.920
You should. Sir.

347
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.560
-You have a Poker face.
-What are you talking about?

348
00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:36.320
Sir. it's just one of those times
you must just ignore.

349
00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.120
Think I'm going to
start taking your advice.

350
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:48.520
Sir. it's double Maths.

351
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.440
You're still here
for another period.

352
00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:54.040
Sir. which section
are you going to teach us?

353
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.720
Well based on your notes…

354
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.600
looks like every
section is a problem.

355
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:09.280
Teach us something. Sir.

356
00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:10.440
Okay. calculus.

357
00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.360
Have you guys
done any calculus?

358
00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:13.840
-No. Sir.
-Nothing?

359
00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.080
Nothing.

360
00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.480
What about exponents
and quadratic equations?

361
00:28:17.560 --> 00:28:20.440
-Sir. you're very optimistic.
-I don't think so. sir.

362
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.560
Okay well then. I think I should
start off with those sections.

363
00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.680
Sir. it's not going to help.

364
00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:26.520
Just give us the free period.

365
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.640
No. I think I'll
start with an explanation.

366
00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:32.960
Okay…

367
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.960
I don't understand what the problem is.
We sent an email ages ago.

368
00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.760
Today is the History exchange class.
We put a lot of time into this program.

369
00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.680
I didn't receive any emails. Mrs…

370
00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.560
Kitchener. You can call me Lynn.

371
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.680
Mrs. Kitchener. can't we postpone?
Today. it's not a good day.

372
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:49.440
Sorry. but our transport's left already.

373
00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.200
Are you going to pay
for the individual cabs to get us home?

374
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.000
Mrs. Khumalo--

375
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.680
There's no teaching today.
It's only paperwork.

376
00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:58.840
Mrs. Khumalo. surely you could…

377
00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:01.440
Surely you could just call
my union representative.

378
00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.600
Goodness. gracious…
Thank you. Mrs. Khumalo.

379
00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.960
-You can go.
-Thank you. Sir.

380
00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:10.400
Don't look at me. Mr. Dorsey.

381
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.320
There's a substitute in 12Y.

382
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.040
Why don't we send them there
until we know what to do?

383
00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.960
He's not going to kick up a fuss.

384
00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:24.360
Mrs. Yorke.
you may just be on to something.

385
00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.320
Come with me.

386
00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.280
Come with me.

387
00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.760
So in the graph equation who can tell me
what represents the gradient?

388
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.720
Come on guys.
this is grade nine Maths.

389
00:29:46.800 --> 00:29:49.240
Sir. are you going to
be here tomorrow?

390
00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:50.600
-I don't know. but--
-Then there's no point

391
00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.160
in starting something.

392
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:53.480
Just give us
the free period already.

393
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.600
Sir. can you please
just show us one thing?

394
00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:58.080
This one.
Question number three.

395
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:02.040
The derivative of the first principle
is as H tends to zero.

396
00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.520
Okay sure. No problem.

397
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:07.360
Okay. the first thing you going
to have to do is write down

398
00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:13.360
if F of X is equal to X two.

399
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.880
then you need to take F.

400
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.960
F of X plus H minus

401
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.920
F of X.

402
00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.200
All of this needs to be over H.

403
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:32.400
Then you need to
substitute this into this.

404
00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.160
So you'll take
the X two and you'll put it in…

405
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.840
or no. actually… Sorry. it goes in…

406
00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.680
No. but then you…

407
00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.440
But you… Doesn't…

408
00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.120
Just give me a second.

409
00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.800
Hey!

410
00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:59.840
-I'm so sorry.
-Mr. Smith.

411
00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:02.400
I am Mr. Dorsey

412
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:05.040
the Vice-Principal.

413
00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.400
Nice to meet you.

414
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.960
I trust everybody
has been on their best behavior.

415
00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.680
Yes. sir.
Everything's fine.

416
00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.880
Good. good.

417
00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:17.160
-Twelve Y…
-I don't know. sir.

418
00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:20.400
Sorry. sir.

419
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.000
Twelve Y.

420
00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.520
today is a very exciting day.

421
00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.840
A group of students
from our Twin Project school

422
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.720
Fern Leaf House.
will be joining us for the day.

423
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.760
I trust you will be
at your best behavior

424
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:39.840
and treat them appropriately.

425
00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:41.920
Am I understood?

426
00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.920
Brian?

427
00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:46.840
Keegan?

428
00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.320
And you. Thandisizwe.

429
00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.040
you keep your mouth in your pants.

430
00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:59.800
Right. Mrs. Kitchener. students.
you may join us.

431
00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.240
Come.

432
00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:12.120
Hello everyone. I'm Lynn Kitchener
and this is my history top set.

433
00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:14.200
These white teachers
and their first names.

434
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.320
-Noluthando…
-Yes. Sir?

435
00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.360
You come and call me
if things get out of hand.

436
00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:23.080
-Yes. Sir.
-Why does no one ever ask me?

437
00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:28.880
No. sorry. please…

438
00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:31.440
-No. no. I insist.
-Can someone please just talk.

439
00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:34.600
All right. Well. 12 Foxes
I suppose you can sit down.

440
00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.560
I'm going to sit with my Black people.

441
00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:50.320
Lynn. there's an error on the board.
may I just…

442
00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.600
Well. this is his class…

443
00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:55.000
-Please just go ahead.
-Thank you.

444
00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.480
Well. this…
This is supposed to be X-squared.

445
00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:02.080
And then if this is the formula.
you substitute that in. which means.

446
00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:09.280
tends to zero. which means that it'll be
X plus H. squared. minus X squared

447
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:15.880
all over H. which means that you're left
with two X H

448
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:19.760
plus H-squared over H
and then you have to take out the H

449
00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.240
because we all know
you can't divide by zero.

450
00:33:25.160 --> 00:33:30.040
…two X plus H over H.

451
00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:34.480
That cancels out that.
which means that the answer is two X.

452
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.640
Well done. Victoria.

453
00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.480
My pleasure. Lynn.

454
00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:41.320
That explanation was a work of art.

455
00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:45.880
Well. Lynn. one could say
that mathematics is the antithesis of art.

456
00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.080
Or is it the foundation upon
which art is built. Victoria?

457
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.920
What in the freaking hell
is happening right now?

458
00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.080
I have no idea. bro.

459
00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.440
She's not here. bro.

460
00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.200
Fucking bitch.

461
00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.600
Pick up the phone. Cindy.

462
00:34:12.159 --> 00:34:13.600
Pick up the fucking phone!

463
00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:17.400
This Nigger is he a tough guy?

464
00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.199
No. he's a pussy.

465
00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:20.440
I want to see his blood.

466
00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.400
-Just say when. bro.
-We go now.

467
00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.360
Okay.
Let's get some tools first.

468
00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:26.480
Good idea.

469
00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.280
Right. guys? So maybe we
should start with introductions.

470
00:34:30.360 --> 00:34:33.639
So maybe someone from 12 Foxes
can go and then someone from 12Y…

471
00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:36.040
-I don't know. Mrs.
-Sorry. what did you say?

472
00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:39.560
I just said that it's amazing

473
00:34:39.639 --> 00:34:42.440
to have such a wonderful visit
from you here by our class.

474
00:34:43.639 --> 00:34:44.960
I'm a Prefect.

475
00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:47.800
So if you need help with anything.
just ask.

476
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.719
Thank you.
That's very kind.

477
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.120
That's anything.

478
00:34:51.199 --> 00:34:54.239
-Okay. so who wants to--
-Anything. Mrs.

479
00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:57.120
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

480
00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.160
All right.
Okay. so who wants to go first?

481
00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.480
She's super hot. bro.

482
00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.080
Victoria. as class captain-ness
maybe you should go.

483
00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.160
Certainly. Lynn.

484
00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.360
Good morning. everyone.

485
00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.400
My name is Victoria Bentley
and I'm the top student at Fern Leaf.

486
00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.080
I take 11 subjects
and have already been

487
00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.040
provisionally accepted
into both Harvard and Cambridge.

488
00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.120
I'm studying pre-med.

489
00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.040
though I'm having a bit of trouble
deciding which one I want to go to.

490
00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.600
Anyway. my motto is 'There's no. no

491
00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.400
if you know.'

492
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:32.120
Thank you. Victoria.
And now someone from 12Y?

493
00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.320
Jama. Who is that?

494
00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:46.240
Yeah. I'm Jama
but you can call me Jah-Man. yo.

495
00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.160
Yeah. sure. Yeah.

496
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.960
Okay.

497
00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.840
Thank you.

498
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.880
-Who would like to go next?
-I'll go. Lynn.

499
00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.920
Hi. everyone.

500
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.880
I'm Britainee.
but not like the singer Britney.

501
00:36:01.960 --> 00:36:05.800
Like Britain. the country
but with an 'ee' on the end.

502
00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.680
Anyway. so I'm hoping to study
a degree in dance and drama

503
00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.120
at the University of Cape Town.

504
00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.800
Yeah. my name is Thandisizwe.

505
00:36:13.560 --> 00:36:16.720
Lover of the land.
The land of my people.

506
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.200
Take it back.
Make it Black.

507
00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:21.880
-Yeah.
-Hi. I'm Josh.

508
00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:25.240
I like surfing. kite surfing.
paragliding.

509
00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:27.880
and chilling with my bro's
at Clifton Fourth.

510
00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.800
My name is Ofno.

511
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:30.880
Ofno?

512
00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:33.720
Of no consequence
to all of you.

513
00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.000
Hi. I'm Jerome.

514
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:39.520
I just want to say
welcome to all the visitors.

515
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:43.200
I know it's disorganized today
but this school is just so.

516
00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:45.880
Here you must
just go with the flow.

517
00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.040
Hi. my name's Chloe.

518
00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:52.320
I just want to say how happy I am
to be a part of this initiative

519
00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.600
and to help
all the disadvantaged people.

520
00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.560
especially all my Black people and how…

521
00:37:00.640 --> 00:37:03.200
I just want to say…

522
00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:07.360
I'm not so sure.

523
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:11.440
My name is Noluthando
and it is my dream to study medicine.

524
00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.320
I want to become a doctor

525
00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:16.080
and work at the clinic
in Gugs where I live.

526
00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:18.840
Li Juan.

527
00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:21.880
Hello. Lynn.

528
00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.320
My name is Brian.

529
00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.720
It's a deep pleasure
to have such a wonderful visit

530
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:27.840
from you here by our class.

531
00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:32.360
I'm very open to
cultural exchange programs.

532
00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.760
That's my number there on the wall

533
00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:37.120
if you need me.

534
00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
I don't know.

535
00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:41.240
Hi.

536
00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.160
I am Malusi.

537
00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:49.960
And hands-off. whiteys and coconuts.
He's mine.

538
00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:54.040
Bukelwa. That's my name.

539
00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.720
You. Say my name.

540
00:37:57.800 --> 00:38:00.160
Bu- ke-lwa.

541
00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:02.680
Bu- kel- wa.

542
00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.560
-Bukelwa.
-Bu- kelwa.

543
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.600
And don't forget it. okay?

544
00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.880
-Bukelwa.
-Thank you. I think that's everyone?

545
00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.000
Lynn. you forgot about Robin.

546
00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:20.880
This is so lame.

547
00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.400
Come on. Robin.

548
00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.480
Fine. I'll give it a go.

549
00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:32.280
Well. it's just that

550
00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.120
no one gets me.

551
00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.680
I feel like
I'm wondering this cosmos alone.

552
00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:40.960
Like a meteor of dark matter

553
00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.280
searching for a poisonous atmosphere

554
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.920
in which to explode brightly
into oblivion.

555
00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:51.200
It's difficult being a thing
of shattered beauty

556
00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:55.520
like a mirror
reflecting the thorn of a rose

557
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.760
shattered into a thousand pieces

558
00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.080
cutting deep into the soles of my feet

559
00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.600
and my footprints

560
00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.040
are red roses of bright blood.

561
00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:11.160
I'm Robin.

562
00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.480
Thank you. Robin.

563
00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.800
So. anyway.
today's a History exchange class.

564
00:39:22.880 --> 00:39:24.040
So I'll do a history lesson.

565
00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:27.440
You history teacher will do a lesson
and then we can exchange notes.

566
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.960
Mrs.. this class does not do History.

567
00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:31.640
What?

568
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:34.040
But we specified History in the emails.

569
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.840
-Why didn't you say anything?
-I'm just a substitute.

570
00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.000
-I don't know what's going on.
-This is just unacceptable.

571
00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:46.560
Okay. 12 Foxes you wait here.

572
00:39:46.640 --> 00:39:49.400
I'm going to go see
if I could speak to someone about this.

573
00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.000
Okay then.

574
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.400
I guess I'm going to

575
00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:58.920
another class.

576
00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:08.160
It was interesting meeting all of you.

577
00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.160
Hey. Chloe.
You like Black people. hey?

578
00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:17.320
Well. yes. of course.
I love my Black people.

579
00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.920
So you want to know
how it feels like to be Black. hey Chloe?

580
00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:23.680
I'm not sure.
Maybe?

581
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.360
Get in.

582
00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.480
Get in where?

583
00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.960
-Look. I don't…
-Hey!

584
00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.040
I would listen to him if I were you.

585
00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:45.960
-Get in. you.
-Okay. okay.

586
00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:58.320
Now you're going to bunk the whole day
like a good Black student. okay?

587
00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.080
Well this is like
a cultural experience. right?

588
00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.200
-Yeah.
-Okay.

589
00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:09.680
Thank you.

590
00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.960
Okay. settle down. everyone.

591
00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:17.680
Who are these?

592
00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.720
It's the exchange students
from Fern Leaf House.

593
00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:21.120
Simone. where are you?

594
00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.400
Such a strange day today
with all these new people here.

595
00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:27.080
I wish you could have seen it.

596
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.240
It's one of those things.

597
00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:32.360
Looks like fun though
and I'm sorry I'm missing it.

598
00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.200
What would you
have said in your introduction?

599
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.440
I would say 'Hi. I'm Simone

600
00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:41.320
and life is such a cruel
and beautiful thing'.

601
00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:43.200
Simone. is everything okay?

602
00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.240
And this is my best friend
in the world. Jerome.

603
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.400
He has such a big heart
and he's so very special.

604
00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.880
Someone.
I want to tell you something.

605
00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.920
-And where is their teacher?
-She just left.

606
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.920
When your teacher comes back.
she must take all of you.

607
00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.440
Sit quiet. please.

608
00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.760
Fuck this.

609
00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:29.960
You exchange ones.
you don't disturb.

610
00:42:30.040 --> 00:42:33.160
You sit very. very quiet. right?
Please.

611
00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.760
And why are you late?

612
00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.560
-I went to the toilet. Mrs.
-You went to the toilet. Mrs.

613
00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:47.560
I don't have to be here.
I did my grade 12.

614
00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.840
Ask yourself.
why are you in 12Y?

615
00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:53.760
Why are you useless?
Why are you stupid?

616
00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:57.720
Why you are going to fail this subject?
Me. I was in 12A.

617
00:42:57.800 --> 00:42:59.240
'A' for Excellent.

618
00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:04.800
Okay. guys.
we're going to carry on

619
00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.480
with Shakes-a-spear.

620
00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.080
King Lear.

621
00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:13.640
We are on the scene in page 116.

622
00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.200
Can someone tell me in shortcut
where we are?

623
00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.080
You. Jama.

624
00:43:21.720 --> 00:43:24.360
Yeah. The King. Mrs.

625
00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.320
His name is Liar and

626
00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.240
he wants to go on a trip. but--

627
00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.520
I'm wasting my time.
Bukelwa?

628
00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:34.160
Hey. why do you always pick me?

629
00:43:35.360 --> 00:43:37.400
Okay. there's these two sisters.

630
00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.200
And then. like the one likes the father.
The other one don't like him.

631
00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.160
And then they fight each other
and the one stabs the other one--

632
00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:46.360
As usual. never paying attention.

633
00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.440
Thandisizwe?

634
00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:49.560
Hey Mrs.. why are we reading
this white people stuff?

635
00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.200
-I hate this.
-My boy.

636
00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:54.600
the day you write a book.
we will read it in this class.

637
00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:00.160
You exchange ones?
No.

638
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:03.600
-You. were you listening?
-Yes. Mrs.

639
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.800
Explain what happened.

640
00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:07.520
Mrs.. it starts off where there is a king.

641
00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:09.320
But everything is good.

642
00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:13.320
Then he thinks. 'Wait.
I want to take a break. okay?'

643
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:17.000
Then he leaves his kids to supervise
and go on. like. a holiday.

644
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:20.680
But things don't go well
because his kids are assholes.

645
00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:23.720
I'm wasting my time here.

646
00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.360
Let's get back to page 116.

647
00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.320
You. Jerome. You are King Lear.

648
00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:33.080
Thandisizwe. you are Kent.

649
00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:36.560
-You. you are the Fool.
-Wow. Mrs.

650
00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:40.320
Read!

651
00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.640
"Hail to there. noble master!"

652
00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:51.960
"Ha! Makest thou this shame thy pastime?"

653
00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.440
"No. my lord."

654
00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:59.560
"He wears cruel garters.

655
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.160
"Horses are tied by the heads.

656
00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:05.800
"dogs and bears by the neck.
monkeys by th'… low-ins?"

657
00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.400
Mrs.. what is 'low-ins'?

658
00:45:08.480 --> 00:45:10.960
It's 'loins'. Like your arms.

659
00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:12.440
Okay.

660
00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:17.240
"Monkeys by the loins
and men by the legs.

661
00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:23.160
"When a man's over lusty at legs
then he wears wooden nether-stocks."

662
00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:28.440
"What's he that hath
so much place mistook

663
00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:29.880
"to set thee here?"

664
00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:34.400
"It is both he and she.
your son and daughter."

665
00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.000
-"No."
-"Yes."

666
00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:39.560
-"No. I say."
-"I say. yeah."

667
00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:41.840
"No. no. they would not."

668
00:45:41.920 --> 00:45:43.560
"Yes. they have."

669
00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:45.760
"By Jupiter. I swear no."

670
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.840
"By…. Juno

671
00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.600
"I swear. aye."

672
00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:54.560
"They durst not dot."

673
00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:59.160
"They could not would not dot.
It is worse than murder."

674
00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.040
That's my lines. bro.

675
00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:05.200
Yeah. but this Fool guy has shit lines.

676
00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.200
"They durst not do't.

677
00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.920
"They could not would not do't;

678
00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.960
"tis worse than murder.

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:18.680
-"To do upon respect--"
-"My Lord. when at their home

680
00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:22.560
I did commend your Highness'
letters to them.

681
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:27.000
"Ere. I was risen and showed…"

682
00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.040
Hey no. Mrs.

683
00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.160
This is too long.
I can't read this.

684
00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:33.280
Yes. skip it.

685
00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:38.160
Let's go to the next scene
on page 126.

686
00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.040
"O. sir.

687
00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:46.840
""you are old.

688
00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.760
"Nature in you stands
on the very verge

689
00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:52.200
"of her confines.

00:46:53.200 --> 00:46:56.240
"You should be ruled
and led by your discretion

00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:59.400
"that discerns your state
better than you. yourself.

692
00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:01.600
"Therefore.

693
00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:05.600
"I pray you that you
do make return to our sister.

694
00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:08.280
"Say you have wronged her. sir."

695
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.520
"Ask her forgiveness?

696
00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:15.680
"Do you but mark
how this becomes the house.

697
00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.440
"Dear daughter.

698
00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:24.680
"I confess that I am old.
but age is not necessary.

699
00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:33.040
"On my knees.
I beg that you'll vouchsafe me raiment.

700
00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.680
food and bed."

701
00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.880
"Good. sir. No.
These are unsightly tricks.

702
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:45.680
Return you to my sister."

703
00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.840
-"Never. Regan."
-Never. Regan!

704
00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:51.520
"Never. Regan.

705
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:56.160
"She hath abated me
of half my train.

706
00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.360
"Looked black upon…

707
00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.080
"Looked black upon me.

708
00:48:01.160 --> 00:48:05.280
"Strike me with her tongue
most serpent-like

709
00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:07.080
"upon the very heart.

710
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.480
"All the sorted vengeance

711
00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:14.160
"of heaven fall
on her ingrateful top!

712
00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:17.560
"Strike her young bones

713
00:48:17.640 --> 00:48:21.560
"you taking airs
with lameness-ness."

714
00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:32.760
"Fie. Sir. fie!"

715
00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:08.200
Class. for homework.
read the next ten pages.

716
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.960
We will discuss in the next class.

717
00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:18.240
-It's break time now. 15 minutes.
-Thank you.

718
00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.360
Maybe we should just wait here.

719
00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.960
I think I'm going
to go get some air outside.

720
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:26.000
Okay. just don't go far.

721
00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.400
I'll just be outside the door.

722
00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:34.040
Hello. guys.

723
00:49:37.680 --> 00:49:39.120
Can I come out now?

724
00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:45.960
Can I come out now?

725
00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.600
Yeah. you can come out for break.

726
00:49:51.840 --> 00:49:55.000
But you come back in the cupboard
when the bell rings. okay?

727
00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:56.160
Okay.

728
00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.520
-Hi.
-Hi.

729
00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.600
I'm Noluthando.
but you can call me Nolu.

730
00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.040
-Victoria.
-Victoria.

731
00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.800
-Yes. you are standing out.
-I get that a lot.

732
00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:30.640
-I want to be a doctor.
-Yes. I heard.

733
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:33.200
You were already accepted?

734
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.520
Yes. it's all about
having the right strategy.

735
00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:38.240
Knowing what to say.
when to say it. who to say it to.

736
00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.320
I applied at UCT and Wits. but.

737
00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:43.400
my marks are not good.

738
00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:47.000
Yeah. that's not surprising.

739
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.440
What can I do?
Do you know of a way?

740
00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.800
Will you be able to assist me?

741
00:50:53.880 --> 00:50:56.400
Of course. Here.

742
00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.480
Give me your number
and your email address.

743
00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:13.320
First thing we need to consider
is what works to your advantage.

744
00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.880
Your skin color.

745
00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.640
It's a major advantage
and you need to use it.

746
00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:18.960
Black is the new white.

747
00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:21.680
You should write this down.

748
00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.880
Right. Number one - skin color.

749
00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:28.720
Secondly. international funding.

750
00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:31.440
There's a lot of it coming in
from Europe for people like you.

751
00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:34.360
International funding…

752
00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:37.040
That's 'internatio-NAL'. not NEL.

753
00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:39.240
A-L. not E-L.

754
00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:41.800
Okay.

755
00:52:01.120 --> 00:52:02.160
Are you from 12Y?

756
00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:05.120
Yeah.
-Is Malusi in your class?

757
00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.240
Yeah.

758
00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:11.720
I shouldn't tell you this
but I owe him from the time

759
00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.120
he stopped those guys from thrashing me
at the soccer tournament.

760
00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.160
Yeah. what?

761
00:52:16.240 --> 00:52:18.520
A friend told me Big Wakes
is coming to the school today

762
00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:19.880
to get Malusi.

763
00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.200
Malusi had a thing
with Cindy from your class.

764
00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.840
Cindy is Big Wakes' girl.

765
00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.880
He's way mad
and he'll even kill Malusi.

766
00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.200
You tell him he must
rather leave. okay?

767
00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.240
Yeah. I'll tell him.

768
00:53:09.840 --> 00:53:12.080
<i>Posh girls. what you doing in our world?</i>

769
00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.160
<i>Looking for cheap thrills. girls?</i>
<i>Walking the steep hills. girls?</i>

770
00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:18.360
<i>Tired of the straight ride. girls?</i>
<i>You want to break your stride. girls?</i>

771
00:53:20.800 --> 00:53:23.240
<i>Street boys.</i>
<i>Forgot to wipe your feet. boys</i>

772
00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.160
<i>You won't get this treat. boys.</i>
<i>Bad manners ain't so sweet. boys</i>

773
00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.680
<i>You'll feel the heat. boys</i>
<i>From this prime-cut meat. boys</i>

774
00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:42.280
<i>Rich girls.</i>
<i>Look down your nose. girls</i>

775
00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:45.080
<i>At my old clothes.</i>
<i>I don't suppose. girl</i>

776
00:53:45.160 --> 00:53:46.200
<i>You even know</i>

777
00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:48.760
<i>Where this could go. girls</i>

778
00:53:50.280 --> 00:53:52.920
<i>Look at all the poor boys</i>
<i>Making a lot of noise</i>

779
00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.680
<i>We ain't just your toys. boys</i>
<i>We know all your ploys. boys</i>

780
00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:58.960
<i>Maybe if you read a book</i>
<i>You'd get a second look. boys</i>

781
00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.680
<i>You're down and out and we out</i>

782
00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:18.200
White people.
They even stole Hip-Hop from us.

783
00:54:18.680 --> 00:54:21.160
Hey. Why did you stop. bro?

784
00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:23.560
It's nothing. Move on.

785
00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:46.880
-Settle down. 12Y.
-I don't know. Mrs.

786
00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:51.080
-Twelve Y.
-I don't know. Mrs.

787
00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.680
That joke is getting old.

788
00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:54.840
Hey. just because apartheid is finished

789
00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.320
don't mean you can talk
whenever you want to.

790
00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:59.840
Hey. shut up you. We'll sort you out
quick-quick after school.

791
00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:00.920
Come on. now settle it.

792
00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.240
I'll bring the whole of Manenberg for you
then you will see. Darkie.

793
00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:04.840
-Enough!
-Khayelitsha girls alone

794
00:55:04.920 --> 00:55:06.680
will eat the whole
of Manenberg for a snack.

795
00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:08.080
Get lost. fucker.

796
00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.280
I said that's enough now!

797
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.960
-But Mrs…
-No. no 'but' Blabla.

798
00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.760
This is entirely your fault
and I've had enough.

799
00:55:13.840 --> 00:55:15.200
-Stand up.
-But Mrs…

800
00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:16.960
I said stand up. Brian.

801
00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:19.400
And just say something.
Anything.

802
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.760
Something.
Anything.

803
00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:29.320
I want you to listen
to me now. Brian.

804
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:30.400
Yes. Mrs.

805
00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.520
And don't you backchat me.

806
00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:34.200
No. Mrs.

807
00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:37.880
You need to stop this racist attitude
from this moment on.

808
00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:39.440
-But. I'm not.
-You are.

809
00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:40.760
You are a racist.

810
00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.920
You're a racist every time you say
something rude concerning Black people.

811
00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000
every time you use
the word 'Darkie'. or worse.

812
00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:48.760
then you're doing
what is called stereotyping

813
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:50.320
and Brian. it's wrong.

814
00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:52.720
Wow. Mrs.. how did you know?

815
00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:57.400
Brian. do you know what stereotyping is?

816
00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.920
When you listen to music
with two earphones. Mrs.

817
00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.640
No. Brian. Stereotyping is when
you try to group people together

818
00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:06.840
predicting their behavior
according to their race.

819
00:56:07.560 --> 00:56:09.040
usually in a negative way.

820
00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:12.000
-And it's wrong.
-But I'm not a racist.

821
00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.680
Okay. fine. Let's see.
Does everyone here give Brian a free pass?

822
00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:20.400
It's to try and prove a point to him.

823
00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.320
Okay. complete this sentence for me.
All Black people…

824
00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.880
Come. the class gave you a free pass.

825
00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.960
All Black people…

826
00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.840
Don't know how to behave. Mrs.

827
00:56:37.320 --> 00:56:39.440
Let's test your theory with a survey.

828
00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:42.560
Who thinks Nolu
doesn't know how to behave?

829
00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:48.880
Who thinks Jama doesn't
know how to behave?

830
00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.080
Okay. fair enough.

831
00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.520
Who thinks Malusi
doesn't know how to behave?

832
00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:06.400
And who thinks
Brian doesn't know how to behave?

833
00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:11.960
Are you getting my point yet. Brian?

834
00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:13.440
Wow. Mrs.

835
00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:16.960
Let's try another one.
All Black people…

836
00:57:19.800 --> 00:57:22.800
Make a lot of children
by a lot of different women.

837
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.760
Let's test that one. Nolu?

838
00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:28.640
My parents are married
and I have two younger brothers. Mrs.

839
00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.840
Are there any children
outside the marriage?

840
00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.120
No. Mrs. They are pastors.

841
00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.680
Okay. Malusi. what about you?

842
00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:39.520
My parents are married. Mrs.
No outside children.

843
00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.840
Okay. Jama?

844
00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:44.160
Wow. Ma'am.

845
00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:49.480
My father is a player. Ma'am.
He have a lot of kids outside.

846
00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.480
Okay. Bukelwa what about you?

847
00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:55.200
My mother would kill my father.

848
00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:57.520
And you. Brian?

849
00:57:58.440 --> 00:57:59.520
My father.

850
00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.840
-No man. Mrs.
-Fair's fair. Brian.

851
00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:03.840
Does he have kids
outside the marriage?

852
00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:09.080
All is outside marriage. Mrs.

853
00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.960
Is it the same mom?

854
00:58:11.640 --> 00:58:13.080
No. Mrs.

855
00:58:13.160 --> 00:58:15.640
-Okay. let's try another one.
-No man. Mrs.!

856
00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.040
Let me make my point. Brian.

857
00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:19.680
All Black people…

858
00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:24.600
They don't work.
They just know how to drink.

859
00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:26.880
Nolu?

860
00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:29.360
My parents don't drink. Mrs..
and they are both working.

861
00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.160
Malusi?

862
00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:34.160
They are both working. Mrs.
They don't drink.

863
00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:36.600
Only my father sometimes.

864
00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:39.280
-Bukelwa?
-My father works.

865
00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:40.800
My mother is at home.

866
00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:43.360
They sometimes drink.
but not so much.

867
00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:45.640
Keegan. what about you?

868
00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:50.320
My father is an alcoholic
and he can't keep a job.

869
00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.720
My mum makes money
selling pies and stuff.

870
00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.960
Okay.
And your father. Brian?

871
00:59:01.360 --> 00:59:03.960
Everyone knows
he drinks all the time. Mrs.

872
00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:11.120
Do you understand
why you shouldn't stereotype?

873
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.120
I think so. Mrs.

874
00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.120
Do you have something to say
to Thandisizwe?

875
00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.480
You are not a 'Darkie'.

876
00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:29.080
I mean. you are.
but not a 'Darkie' Darkie.

877
00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:33.760
I'm not going to listen to music
with two earphones anymore.

878
00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:39.040
Yeah. Mrs. That's the best
we're going to get from him.

879
00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.160
It's cool.

880
00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:44.640
Yo. bro. You got schooled.

881
00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:46.080
Get lost. man.

882
00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:53.640
Does anybody here travel
from Bonteheuwel with Simone?

883
00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:58.280
Excuse me. Mr. Dorsey.
We're in the middle of a class here.

884
00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:00.120
Now is not the time. Mrs. Botes.

885
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.720
And anyway.
I don't see any books open.

886
01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.320
It doesn't seem
as if any work is being done.

887
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.880
Can anybody answer my question?

888
01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:09.000
-Me. Sir.
-Have you seen her this morning?

889
01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.560
No. Sir.
She wasn't at the terminus this morning.

890
01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:13.520
Have you spoken to her
or messaged her?

891
01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.600
I did message her. Sir.
but she didn't read it yet.

892
01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:18.240
Anybody else here traveling
from Bonteheuwel?

893
01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.360
No. Sir.

894
01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:24.080
Okay. Thank you.

895
01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.000
Sorry. Mrs.

896
01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:37.240
Sir.

897
01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:40.200
why did you ask those questions. Sir?

898
01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.680
It's nothing. Jerome.
just get back to your class.

899
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.360
That's it.
That fucking rude bastard.

900
01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:49.600
Whoa. Mrs.

901
01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.640
I can't do this anymore.

902
01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.640
What do you mean. Ma'am?

903
01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.360
I'm done.

904
01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:57.360
You quitting. Mrs.?

905
01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:00.360
Yes.

906
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.680
No. Mrs. No. no.
You can't quit.

907
01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:11.480
Please Sir. man.
she's my friend.

908
01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:15.280
Look. nothing is confirmed.
so it probably is nothing.

909
01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:16.720
Please. Sir.

910
01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.360
Look. the story
is going around the school.

911
01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:22.280
You're probably going to hear it anyway.

912
01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:28.000
The body of a young girl
was found on an open field.

913
01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.200
two streets away
from where she lives.

914
01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.560
I can't get hold of her
or her parents.

915
01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:36.480
The police told me they'll inform me
as soon as they have an I.D.

916
01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.760
but it could be anyone.

917
01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:42.160
I'm just trying to make sure.
Now just get back to your class. Jerome.

918
01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:54.400
You can't go. Mrs.

919
01:01:54.480 --> 01:01:56.400
You're the best teacher
in the school. Mrs.

920
01:01:56.480 --> 01:01:58.480
I don't expect
you guys to understand.

921
01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:03.160
It's nothing personal against you guys.

922
01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.240
I'm sorry.

923
01:02:06.320 --> 01:02:07.600
Fuck this. man.

924
01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.160
Mr. Dorsey.

925
01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.560
Get back to your class now.

926
01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.960
Why aren't you
in your class. Mrs. Botes?

927
01:02:30.040 --> 01:02:32.600
Bro. you missed it.
Botes just quit.

928
01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.560
Jerome. what's wrong?

929
01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:38.480
They found a body
on the field there by us.

930
01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.160
He wanted to make sure it's not her.

931
01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:46.240
But they find a body every week by us.
So I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

932
01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.720
Do you know what I was teaching them?

933
01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:51.120
Good manners. politeness.

934
01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:52.560
and a good attitude
to fellow human beings.

935
01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.640
I'm in a hurry. Mrs. Botes.
What is your point?

936
01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:58.600
My point is. Mr. Dorsey. I quit.
You can take care of the class.

937
01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:03.000
And it's a double period.

938
01:03:03.680 --> 01:03:07.040
No. wait. I have them for L.O.
after break. Three in a row.

939
01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:10.160
Now. isn't that
a well-constructed timetable?

940
01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:17.840
For the love of all
that's good in this world.

941
01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.800
I'm sure it's nothing. guys.

942
01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.520
She's probably
feeling sick or just sleeping-in.

943
01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.040
Where's the teacher?

944
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.960
It's a long story.

945
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.440
Okay. well. 12 Foxes. listen up.

946
01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:51.480
Guys. I think I hear
my teacher calling me.

947
01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:55.000
You can't leave.
You have to bunk all day. okay?

948
01:03:55.080 --> 01:03:57.120
No. no. no. no. no.
I can't do that.

949
01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:59.080
I can't seem to get
anywhere in this place.

950
01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:02.560
Guess we're just going to have to
chalk this one down to experience.

951
01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:09.040
Smoke this.
It's part of the experience.

952
01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.520
Right class.
Settle down.

953
01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:21.160
I will be supervising this class
until we have a substitute.

954
01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:24.720
Mrs. Botes just needs a bit of time.

955
01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:32.880
Yeah. it's a cultural journey.

956
01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:35.480
Take out your books
and get down to doing something.

957
01:04:35.560 --> 01:04:38.080
-I could just…
-Just be quiet. I asked you to be quiet.

958
01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.320
-I just wanted to say that I…
-Right. you. out.

959
01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.040
-But I…
-Out now!

960
01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.000
You know what? Fine. I'll leave.

961
01:04:44.560 --> 01:04:45.640
Can't believe this.

962
01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.600
Any more exchange students
have anything to say?

963
01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:53.960
Sir. my stomach is sore. Sir.

964
01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:56.640
Sir. I must go to the toilet. Sir.

965
01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:59.200
Brian. Don't start!

966
01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:02.600
Sir. I ate a samosa from the tuck shop.
it was maybe off or something.

967
01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.360
Sir. I must go
or I'm going to crap in my pants. Sir!

968
01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:08.400
-For Heaven's sake.
-Sir…

969
01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:09.520
You'd better not
be trying something.

970
01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.560
You can come smell the toilet. Sir.

971
01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:14.040
Just. get out of my face!

972
01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.320
Get!

973
01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:18.560
The rest of you.

974
01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.200
take out your books
and get down to doing something.

975
01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.160
I hope that doesn't set on fire.

976
01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:38.080
Yeah. it's burning up my nose.
I love it.

977
01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.240
This is great.

978
01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.800
Mrs.!

979
01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:44.800
Mrs.!

980
01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.280
Well. well. What a coincidence.

981
01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.480
We seem to be heading
in the same direction.

982
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:53.400
-I'm not in the mood right now.
-Relax. Mrs.

983
01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:56.320
Mr. Dorsey wanted me
to give you a tour of our school.

984
01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:57.400
You're so full of it.

985
01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:01.840
Yes. I am.
but do you have anything better to do?

986
01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:07.080
I suppose not.
Where can I go for a cigarette?

987
01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.040
I know just the spot.

988
01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.360
May I take your bag. my lady?

989
01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:13.920
-No. it's…
-It's all right.

990
01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:15.800
Prefect.

991
01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.280
Just hold on.

992
01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:22.440
Sorry. sir.

993
01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:25.320
This way.

994
01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:27.960
Sorry. sir.

995
01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:30.280
Why did you do that?

996
01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:34.400
I don't know. Mrs.
Everyone else does it.

997
01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.360
Don't you think
it distracts the class?

998
01:07:36.440 --> 01:07:37.720
From what. Mrs.?

999
01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:39.760
Fair enough. I suppose.

1000
01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:42.320
This way. Lynn.

1001
01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:50.000
Thank goodness. Mr. Smith.

1002
01:07:50.080 --> 01:07:51.760
Sorry to shuffle you around like this

1003
01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:54.720
but could you take
care of a class. please?

1004
01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.360
It's a bit of an emergency.

1005
01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:58.800
-Sure thing. No problem.
-Thank you.

1006
01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.000
Where's your teacher?

1007
01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.880
-Mr. Dorsey kicked her out.
-What?

1008
01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:18.760
Yeah. he was very angry.
Classic bullied-as-a-child syndrome.

1009
01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:22.520
You'd know. You're the expert.

1010
01:08:22.600 --> 01:08:25.120
-Are we going to do more Maths. Sir?
-I don't think so.

1011
01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:28.359
Just take out your books
and work on something.

1012
01:08:28.439 --> 01:08:30.720
Didn't take you long
to get into the flow of things.

1013
01:08:31.479 --> 01:08:35.120
What flow? There is no flow.
That's the problem.

1014
01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.520
Well put. Sir.

1015
01:08:39.399 --> 01:08:42.479
See here. Mrs.? Perfect.
Just for you.

1016
01:08:54.880 --> 01:08:56.279
How about one for me?

1017
01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:00.040
What the hell. There you go.

1018
01:09:05.240 --> 01:09:06.960
You don't smoke.
So why did you ask for a cigarette?

1019
01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:09.880
Of course. I smoke.
this is just a very weak cigarette.

1020
01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.880
I'm used stronger ones.
that's all.

1021
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:14.880
No. no. Give me that.
I'm not starting you off on a bad habit.

1022
01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.680
So caring.

1023
01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:25.000
Why do you try your level best
to be the pissiest student in the class?

1024
01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.000
Man…

1025
01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:28.960
I just got to say it.

1026
01:09:29.640 --> 01:09:32.279
You're so pretty.
Perfs…

1027
01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:36.040
-Perfect.
-Don't deflect from my question.

1028
01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:38.240
-Why?
-I'm serious Mrs.

1029
01:09:38.319 --> 01:09:41.240
My heart is beating so fast.
Here. feel.

1030
01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:44.720
I'll think about it if you tell me
why you behave so obnoxiously?

1031
01:09:49.479 --> 01:09:50.479
Mrs.

1032
01:09:51.439 --> 01:09:52.479
I'm so short…

1033
01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.600
if I didn't make a noise…

1034
01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:05.560
-Yeah. we better get back.
-Yeah. Mrs.

1035
01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:09.240
Before you do something crazy.
I know I'm irresistible to women.

1036
01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:12.120
Maybe one day
when you can actually grow a beard.

1037
01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.320
some girl might
give you the time of day.

1038
01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.840
A part of me
is growing right now as we speak.

1039
01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:20.240
Jeez.

1040
01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.080
Hey. girlie. haven't you got
a two Rand there for me?

1041
01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:42.160
No way. I'm not in the mood for you.
Just walk away.

1042
01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:44.440
Please. Not today.

1043
01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:53.080
I am not afraid of small spaces.

1044
01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:57.400
They try to confine us in our mind
and put us in small spaces.

1045
01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.640
But. no!

1046
01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.600
We are free.

1047
01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.040
Well. not if you're actually put in
a little spot like this one.

1048
01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:16.760
You know what? It's my dream to have
my wedding on Top Billing.

1049
01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:21.240
Like. all my furniture from overseas.

1050
01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:28.840
My bed from Japan
and my couch from Italy.

1051
01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:33.120
My fridge from London
because it's cold there.

1052
01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:37.000
All my clothes from Paris.
You know what I mean?

1053
01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:38.080
Malusi?

1054
01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:39.760
Are you listening?

1055
01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:43.360
Why do people stay together?

1056
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.600
What do you mean?

1057
01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:52.120
Like.
why do old married people stay together?

1058
01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:55.760
There are all these
beautiful girls out there.

1059
01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.480
Why does the man
stay with his old wife?

1060
01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:03.960
He must stay with her
because he married her.

1061
01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.800
she gave him children
now her body is all worn out.

1062
01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:09.360
So it is for guilt and not for love?

1063
01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:10.920
No. that is love.

1064
01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.080
So love is guilt?

1065
01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:15.480
No man. what are you talking about?

1066
01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:19.640
I'm talking about my dreams
like my garden with red roses.

1067
01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.960
You just don't understand.

1068
01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:33.400
You know. this is…
This is me becoming a part of them

1069
01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.280
and becoming a part of my ancestors.

1070
01:12:37.600 --> 01:12:39.560
Yeah. I could do this.

1071
01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:46.360
<i>We are freedom fighters</i>

1072
01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:51.720
<i>We are in tight spaces.</i>
<i>But we will rise… rise….</i>

1073
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.520
<i>Rise. rise…</i>

1074
01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:55.920
Got to hit that note.

1075
01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.600
Li Juan.

1076
01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:09.760
Britainee.

1077
01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.720
You help me?

1078
01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.840
Sure. if I can.
Why. what's up?

1079
01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.400
Want to look pretty like you.

1080
01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:28.560
What. do you mean like…
Like blonde?

1081
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.520
No. Like.

1082
01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.000
hairstyle.

1083
01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:37.840
paint face. nice clothes.

1084
01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:45.680
You mean like…
Like a makeover?

1085
01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.560
Want to look nice for…

1086
01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:54.480
You like a boy?

1087
01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.480
Is he in this class?

1088
01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:01.640
Girl. don't even worry.

1089
01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:05.040
We are going to
turn you into such a diva.

1090
01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:08.200
We are going to drive that guy crazy.

1091
01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:13.360
It's not like this is abuse or anything.

1092
01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.400
Hey. is this abuse?

1093
01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:23.360
It's okay. It's fine. I'm fine!
This is great!

1094
01:14:24.440 --> 01:14:27.040
I'm strong.

1095
01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:28.800
Yes!

1096
01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.120
Okay.
Get in contact with this list of people.

1097
01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.760
Maybe I should introduce you.

1098
01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:36.640
We could go and have.
like. coffee meetings.

1099
01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:39.000
-Someplace nice.
-Thank you.

1100
01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.040
This one is particularly important.

Where are you going to hang for break?

1116

1117
01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:42.880
-No. I think I'm going to stay here.
-Okay.

1118
01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:46.440
-You're on my spot.
-Sorry bro. I'll just move.

No. white boy.
That spot's also taken.

1120
01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:53.400
So…

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:57.920
Nowhere. bro.

This school is only for Brown people
and Black people.

Fuck it. bro.

1125

Yeah. you guys

Bro. if you don't have
good-school money. you fucked.

Everyone knows that.

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:00.840
Well. I don't have money.
I got a scholarship.

1140
01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:04.560
And they painted you white
as part of your repayment plan?

01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.800
Hey!

1192
01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:04.760
What are you doing with my brother?

1193
01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:22.280
What the fuck
is going on at this school?

1194
01:28:28.160 --> 01:28:30.080
So do you want my digits?

1195
01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:39.600
Call me.

1196
01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:44.480
Okay.

Wait.

1201
01:28:58.000 --> 01:28:59.360
You've got the wrong guy.

1202
01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:03.400
-For fuck's sakes. man!
-I was by Cindy's this morning.

1203
01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.440
I don't know. bro.
They all look the same with the hair.

1204
01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:09.680
-You know what I mean?
-So you're the pig who fucked Cindy?

1205
01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.200
I don't remember.

1206
01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:13.760
-No one remembers anything!
-Two thousand…

1207
01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:16.160
Eight hundred.

1208
01:29:18.560 --> 01:29:19.840
I'm sure you really nice

1209
01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:21.720
and I love sushi

1210
01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:27.440
but we're on different journeys.
you and I.

1211
01:29:27.520 --> 01:29:29.840
In the global metaphor of life.

1212
01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:32.320
I'm the undulating dunes

1213
01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:35.880
of a parched desert
in the darkest hour of the night.

1214
01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:37.240
And you.

1215
01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:42.280
you're three tiny green plants.
growing in someone's back garden

1216
01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:44.240
in between paving stones.

1217
01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:50.840
-What you say?
-How do I put this better?

1218
01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.400
Shoot this motherfucker!

1219
01:29:58.760 --> 01:29:59.880
Hey. Wakes!

1220
01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:02.160
What the hell are you doing there?

1221
01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.680
Well. don't stand there
with a mouthful of teeth.

1222
01:30:06.760 --> 01:30:08.400
Come. let me hear.

1223
01:30:08.480 --> 01:30:11.480
Cindy. I heard you've been
messing around with this Nigger.

1224
01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:12.920
What?

1225
01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:16.680
I heard you've been
messing around with this Nigger!

1226
01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:19.440
So what if I did?
Where were you last weekend?

1227
01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:20.880
A little birdie told me that

1228
01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:24.200
you were there with that whore Janice
there in Strandfontein!

1229
01:30:24.960 --> 01:30:26.360
Cindy. I'm in the middle of something.

1230
01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:30.000
In the middle of a rock and a hard place
you sick. wet. fucker!

1231
01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:35.560
-Cindy. please.
-Now it's 'Cindy please'?

1232
01:30:36.200 --> 01:30:37.880
Good manners
aren't going to help you now!

1233
01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:39.920
You can't just come here
and tell me what to do!

1234
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:41.960
You are not the boss of me!

1235
01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:49.320
What I'm trying to say is.
I'm gender fluid.

1236
01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:54.240
I mean. what these pigeonholes
we put ourselves in anyways.

1237
01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:55.960
I'm like liquid water at the point

1238
01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:59.200
just before it becomes steam
and at that point…

1239
01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:08.040
-Have you heard of Pan sexual?
-What?

1240
01:31:08.640 --> 01:31:10.320
Have you heard of Asexual?

1241
01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.360
Sapiosexual?

1242
01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.400
Well. I'm at the nexus of all three.

1243
01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.640
I'm Aspanpiosexual.

1244
01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:28.960
So you say no call me?

1245
01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.240
I say no call you.

1246
01:31:37.400 --> 01:31:39.800
You kill my brother now I kill you.

1247
01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:43.280
Malusi!

1248
01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:47.800
What am I hearing that you have
a thing with Cindy?

1249
01:31:54.640 --> 01:31:56.080
Answer me!

1250
01:31:56.160 --> 01:31:57.800
-I didn't do anything.
-You didn't do anything!

1251
01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.000
You. just

1252
01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:03.320
leave. me!

1253
01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.120
Get lost!

1254
01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:13.160
Actually. I don't think that he…

1255
01:32:13.240 --> 01:32:16.600
You stay out of it.
It's none of your business. man.

1256
01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.120
Out of my way!

1257
01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:30.520
Roberto. fuck it.
Let's just go.

1258
01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:33.080
-But…
-No. no buts.

1259
01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:35.760
Let's just go.

1260
01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:21.960
Simone. I can't even explain to you
how crazy this day has been.

1261
01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:23.440
I can see. yes.

1262
01:33:23.520 --> 01:33:25.560
Simone there's something
I want to tell you.

1263
01:33:26.720 --> 01:33:29.640
And I'm scared if I don't say it now.

1264
01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.640
I'm never going
to get the chance to say it.

1265
01:33:33.680 --> 01:33:35.640
-I just want to say that…
-No Jerome. stop.

1266
01:33:37.040 --> 01:33:38.040
Why?

1267
01:33:38.120 --> 01:33:39.720
What you want to say.

1268
01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:43.920
it's the kind of thing
you must say to someone in person.

1269
01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.640
someone who's really there.

1270
01:33:46.520 --> 01:33:49.800
And I'm not really here. Jerome.
You can't waste it.

1271
01:33:50.680 --> 01:33:52.720
It must be for someone
who can say it back to you.

1272
01:33:53.400 --> 01:33:55.360
-But Simone…
-Jerome.

1273
01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:57.720
I'm sorry.

1274
01:34:00.440 --> 01:34:01.680
They're here.

1275
01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:43.800
I'm sorry.

1276
01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:53.040
All of you from Fern Leaf House.
get out.

1277
01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:56.320
What do you mean?

1278
01:34:56.400 --> 01:35:00.520
You all have no right to be here for this.
Get out. Get out!

1279
01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:02.440
-What's going on?
-Come on 12 Foxes.

1280
01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:04.520
-But why?
-Just get the hell out!

1281
01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.560
Let's not ask questions. let's just go.
