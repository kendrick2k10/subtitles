What are we even

of the city and get away

184
00:15:58.566 --> 00:15:59.610
from how busy you are.

185
00:15:59.784 --> 00:16:01.177
- JAIME: Yes! Yes! Get away!

186
00:16:01.351 --> 00:16:03.092
Not be trapped for a week
with the last person I--

187
00:16:07.009 --> 00:16:08.445
- The last person that what?

188
00:16:15.409 --> 00:16:17.280
What. Jamie?

189
00:16:20.457 --> 00:16:22.285
- My whole life is
for someone else.

190
00:16:23.808 --> 00:16:25.071
We live in the city.
because that's

191
00:16:25.245 --> 00:16:27.464
where you are more comfortable.

192
00:16:27.638 --> 00:16:30.032
I stay at a fucking job I hate.

193
00:16:30.206 --> 00:16:32.730
that I am extremely
overqualified for.

194
00:16:32.904 --> 00:16:36.386
so there is a house.
and retirement account.

195
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.128
and insurance--
- Where is this all coming from?

196
00:16:40.738 --> 00:16:42.566
You and I always talked
about everything.

197
00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.741
- Hey. you talk.

198
00:16:43.915 --> 00:16:45.743
You talk and I listen.

199
00:16:45.917 --> 00:16:47.789
And after Ally--

200
00:16:47.963 --> 00:16:49.008
- Don't you do that.

201
00:16:50.618 --> 00:16:51.749
Don't use her as an excuse.

202
00:16:51.923 --> 00:16:52.794
- You wanted kids.

203
00:16:52.968 --> 00:16:54.230
I wanted you. and now--

204
00:16:54.404 --> 00:16:56.537
- Fuck you. Jamie!

205
00:16:56.711 --> 00:16:58.887
You think that-that
doesn't affect me. too?

206
00:16:59.061 --> 00:17:03.022
Like. I'm not in agony
over the whole thing?

207
00:17:04.849 --> 00:17:07.417
I feel so.

208
00:17:09.506 --> 00:17:10.594
so sad.

209
00:17:12.205 --> 00:17:13.554
And angry.

210
00:17:16.252 --> 00:17:17.949
And guilty.

211
00:17:20.387 --> 00:17:22.563
But I can't even talk
to you about it.

212
00:17:22.737 --> 00:17:24.695
because you just shut down.

213
00:17:26.436 --> 00:17:28.395
[cries]

214
00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:29.613
- Look.

215
00:17:31.441 --> 00:17:32.790
I think we both know

216
00:17:32.964 --> 00:17:34.444
this is just postponing
the inevitable.

217
00:17:40.059 --> 00:17:41.234
No! Don't stand--

218
00:17:43.236 --> 00:17:47.240
[muffled shouting]

219
00:17:53.289 --> 00:17:54.464
[bone breaking]
[muffled scream]

220
00:17:54.638 --> 00:17:55.944
JAIME: Alex!

221
00:17:56.118 --> 00:17:58.773
- ALEX: Oh fuck!
- I got you!

222
00:17:58.947 --> 00:18:00.079
[screams]

223
00:18:00.253 --> 00:18:01.384
JAIME: Come on.

224
00:18:03.169 --> 00:18:07.042
[screaming]

225
00:18:11.786 --> 00:18:13.004
JAIME:
Shit! All of our stuff...

226
00:18:13.179 --> 00:18:17.531
[Alex sobs]

227
00:18:17.705 --> 00:18:19.359
You're gonna be okay.

228
00:18:19.533 --> 00:18:21.274
- Oh. my leg...

229
00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:22.536
Fuck...

230
00:18:22.710 --> 00:18:24.712
[grunting]

231
00:18:24.886 --> 00:18:26.366
- The town is just
a few miles away.

232
00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:28.542
You're gonna be okay.

233
00:18:28.716 --> 00:18:29.978
We will go slow.

234
00:18:51.347 --> 00:18:53.697
Hey. hey. Lex?

235
00:18:53.871 --> 00:18:55.177
- My leg...

236
00:19:21.247 --> 00:19:23.945
- Hey! Hey! Lex?

237
00:19:24.119 --> 00:19:25.555
I need you to stay awake. okay?

238
00:19:25.729 --> 00:19:27.122
- Can we stop?

239
00:19:29.298 --> 00:19:31.257
We're almost done. okay.

240
00:19:32.823 --> 00:19:34.695
We're close.
just a bit farther.

241
00:19:38.742 --> 00:19:39.787
Hey. a car!

242
00:19:39.961 --> 00:19:41.702
Hey! Hey Lex. look!

243
00:19:41.876 --> 00:19:43.051
Look!

244
00:19:45.445 --> 00:19:47.664
[whistle blowing]

245
00:19:57.935 --> 00:19:59.633
Oh. thank God. a person.

246
00:19:59.807 --> 00:20:01.200
Hey!

247
00:20:01.374 --> 00:20:02.244
Hello!

248
00:20:02.418 --> 00:20:04.246
Hey! Hey!

249
00:20:04.420 --> 00:20:05.856
Hello?

250
00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.207
Hey. we need a little he--

251
00:20:08.381 --> 00:20:09.643
We need a little--

252
00:20:09.817 --> 00:20:11.819
Oh. Lex.

253
00:20:11.993 --> 00:20:14.430
Lex. hey!
Hey. we're almost done.

254
00:20:14.604 --> 00:20:16.867
Okay. Help is almost here.

255
00:20:17.041 --> 00:20:18.173
Just stay with me.

256
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.882
[gun shot]

257
00:20:32.056 --> 00:20:33.144
Oh!

258
00:20:34.798 --> 00:20:36.670
Holy shit! He just--

259
00:20:41.109 --> 00:20:43.111
Oh. no! No!

260
00:20:47.158 --> 00:20:48.769
[tense music]

261
00:20:52.599 --> 00:20:54.470
Hey!

262
00:20:54.644 --> 00:20:56.037
Hey. is anybody there?

263
00:20:57.256 --> 00:20:58.779
Hey! Hey!

264
00:20:58.953 --> 00:21:00.259
Hey. please!

265
00:21:04.045 --> 00:21:06.308
[gasps]

266
00:21:06.482 --> 00:21:07.570
- TATER:
Move away from the Hep!

267
00:21:07.744 --> 00:21:09.093
- Wait. what?
- Step aside.

268
00:21:09.268 --> 00:21:11.008
I can see she got the bug.

269
00:21:11.182 --> 00:21:12.662
- We were just trying to
get to the hospital.

270
00:21:12.836 --> 00:21:14.664
- Step aside.

271
00:21:14.838 --> 00:21:16.231
- No. please! He is insane.

272
00:21:16.405 --> 00:21:18.494
He just shot a man over there.

273
00:21:18.668 --> 00:21:20.279
- Tater?
- This one won't move aside.

274
00:21:20.453 --> 00:21:22.890
otherwise I'd have that Hep
down already. Big John.

275
00:21:23.064 --> 00:21:25.240
- I-- I don't even know
what he's talking about.

276
00:21:25.414 --> 00:21:26.850
Please!

277
00:21:27.024 --> 00:21:28.939
- You're just gonna
shoot us for no reason?

278
00:21:31.899 --> 00:21:32.813
- It spoke.

279
00:21:32.987 --> 00:21:35.250
[panting]

280
00:21:35.424 --> 00:21:36.512
What happened to you all?

281
00:21:36.686 --> 00:21:38.122
- She hurt her leg.

282
00:21:38.297 --> 00:21:39.776
We're just trying to get
to town for a hospital

283
00:21:39.950 --> 00:21:42.039
when this psycho
started shooting at us.

284
00:21:42.213 --> 00:21:43.650
- I-- I thought
she was one of 'em.

285
00:21:43.824 --> 00:21:45.695
- He just killed someone
right over there!

286
00:21:45.869 --> 00:21:47.523
We saw him.
- Jamie?

287
00:21:49.046 --> 00:21:50.309
Jamie Miller?

288
00:21:52.833 --> 00:21:55.052
It's Bernie.
We went to Junior High together.

289
00:21:56.663 --> 00:21:58.273
That's Jamie Miller.
Robert's daughter.

290
00:22:00.928 --> 00:22:01.755
- You know my dad?

291
00:22:01.929 --> 00:22:03.278
- Well. yeah. of course!

292
00:22:03.452 --> 00:22:04.540
Hell. our home base
is in his warehouse.

293
00:22:04.714 --> 00:22:06.325
But he went out to--
- Bernie!

294
00:22:06.499 --> 00:22:08.196
Get back in there and
get this thing ready to roll.

295
00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:10.111
- Yeah. yeah.

296
00:22:10.285 --> 00:22:12.069
- What happened to her?

297
00:22:12.243 --> 00:22:14.289
- Broke my leg.

298
00:22:14.463 --> 00:22:16.639
- Seems we have a bit of
a misunderstanding here.

299
00:22:16.813 --> 00:22:18.380
- We need to get
to the hospital.

300
00:22:18.554 --> 00:22:19.599
- Hospital's no good.

301
00:22:19.773 --> 00:22:20.774
It's been overrun.

302
00:22:21.992 --> 00:22:23.167
- Overrun?

303
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:26.040
- Where y'all been?

304
00:22:26.214 --> 00:22:28.347
- We-- We've been out camping.

305
00:22:29.913 --> 00:22:31.393
What the hell is going on?

306
00:22:31.567 --> 00:22:33.221
- This outbreak
or whatever it is.

307
00:22:33.395 --> 00:22:35.266
Hit us fast and hard.

308
00:22:35.441 --> 00:22:38.139
- They were saying
they had it under control.

309
00:22:38.313 --> 00:22:40.184
- Seems there's what they say
up there. and then.

310
00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:41.925
there's what we see
here on the ground.

311
00:22:43.536 --> 00:22:45.146
- DIANE: Gruber? Sterling's boys
just turned off the

312
00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.061
main road up here.
they're heading your way.

313
00:22:47.235 --> 00:22:48.584
- Copy that. Diane.

314
00:22:48.758 --> 00:22:49.759
Bernie. how long?

315
00:22:49.933 --> 00:22:51.326
We gotta get this off the road.

316
00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.893
- BERNIE: She's ready.

317
00:22:53.067 --> 00:22:54.764
- Tater. you get this RV
back to the warehouse.

318
00:22:54.938 --> 00:22:55.809
- You got it. Big John.

319
00:22:55.983 --> 00:22:57.419
Bernie!

320
00:22:57.593 --> 00:22:58.725
- BERNIE: Yeah.
- In the back of the truck.

321
00:22:58.899 --> 00:22:59.726
Make sure nothing
bothers these two.

322
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:00.770
- Yes.

323
00:23:02.076 --> 00:23:03.077
- GRUBER:
Get her over to Louie's.

324
00:23:03.251 --> 00:23:04.644
It's a vet clinic.

325
00:23:04.818 --> 00:23:06.167
Fix up her leg.

326
00:23:08.604 --> 00:23:10.214
You can trust me.

327
00:23:15.002 --> 00:23:17.308
- Again. we ask everyone.
please stay indoors

328
00:23:17.483 --> 00:23:19.310
and wait further instructions
from the authorities.

329
00:23:19.485 --> 00:23:21.487
Now. I have some data

330
00:23:21.661 --> 00:23:25.316
for you which is uh. good news.
- [dog howling &amp; barking]

331
00:23:25.491 --> 00:23:28.450
- What we're seeing in my office
from the more populated areas.

332
00:23:28.624 --> 00:23:29.669
those are the areas

333
00:23:29.843 --> 00:23:31.540
with a population of uh.

334
00:23:31.714 --> 00:23:33.673
- Oh. son of a bitch!

335
00:23:33.847 --> 00:23:35.544
- TIRED GOVERNOR:
50.000 or more. 50.000.

336
00:23:35.718 --> 00:23:37.938
Uh. we're seeing less infections
per day than two days ago.

337
00:23:38.112 --> 00:23:39.287
- GRUBER: Louie!

338
00:23:39.461 --> 00:23:41.115
- Alright. alright.

339
00:23:41.289 --> 00:23:42.682
- GRUBER: Open up!
- TIRED GOVERNOR: That's good.

340
00:23:42.856 --> 00:23:44.466
That's an improvement.
What we need

341
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.859
from the rest of the state...
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

342
00:23:46.033 --> 00:23:46.642
Don't bring her in here
if she's got it.

343
00:23:46.816 --> 00:23:47.643
- She doesn't.

344
00:23:47.817 --> 00:23:48.775
It's just a broken leg.

345
00:23:48.949 --> 00:23:50.733
- You have to help us. Please.

346
00:23:50.907 --> 00:23:52.300
- GOVERNOR: Our city has mo--
more populated places.

347
00:23:53.823 --> 00:23:54.955
As my father used to say
and I agree with this

348
00:23:55.129 --> 00:23:56.696
- Bring her back.

349
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:58.872
- GOVERNOR: from my TV show
in the 1950s.

350
00:23:59.046 --> 00:24:01.570
Just the facts. man.
just-- just the facts.

351
00:24:03.006 --> 00:24:04.573
- Alright.
Put her down right here.

352
00:24:04.747 --> 00:24:06.749
You can wheel that cart over
to put her legs on it.

353
00:24:06.923 --> 00:24:08.272
- GRUBER: You're doing
the right thing here.

354
00:24:08.447 --> 00:24:10.187
- I'm not gonna be
your personal physician.

355
00:24:10.361 --> 00:24:11.928
- We need you. Louie.

356
00:24:12.102 --> 00:24:13.103
- Don't start with me again.
We talked about it.

357
00:24:13.277 --> 00:24:14.540
- This is a critical situation.

358
00:24:14.714 --> 00:24:15.932
How things are out there.

359
00:24:16.106 --> 00:24:17.020
Difference between
life and death.

360
00:24:17.194 --> 00:24:18.761
is a game of inches.

361
00:24:18.935 --> 00:24:20.241
- Don't give me your game
of inches bullshit. alright.

362
00:24:20.415 --> 00:24:21.938
It won't gonna work on me.

- LOUIE: I'm not gonna be
ammunition for your little--

happens to you

377

- Governor's orders.

381
00:24:52.795 --> 00:24:54.318
- The Governor's got bigger
problems in the cities.

382

- Is this a hospital?

383
00:24:57.321 --> 00:24:58.758
- It's a vet's office.
It's okay.

384
00:24:58.932 --> 00:25:00.629
You're gonna be okay.

people are dying out there.

386
00:25:04.067 --> 00:25:06.113
If we don't take action.
more will die.

387
00:25:10.073 --> 00:25:11.379
- What did you give her?

388
00:25:11.553 --> 00:25:13.294
- Just something
to help her sleep.

389
00:25:13.468 --> 00:25:14.600
Alright. will you guys
get the hell out of here now!

390

So. I can focus.

I mean. that's a bad break.
but she'll be okay.

It's very important.
I wanna-- I wanna emphasize

00:34:02.127 --> 00:34:03.041
- Hey. watch your mouth there.

543
00:34:03.215 --> 00:34:04.607
- Oh shit.

544
00:34:04.781 --> 00:34:05.695
- You guys just get
the hell away from me.

545
00:34:05.869 --> 00:34:07.175
- Louie. hey! Think.

546
00:34:07.349 --> 00:34:09.569
If they scratched you.
you go--

547
00:34:09.743 --> 00:34:11.397
BERNIE:
Come out here. Louie.

548
00:34:11.571 --> 00:34:12.920
- LOUIE: Just get the hell
out of here. all of you!

549
00:34:13.094 --> 00:34:14.269
- BERNIE: You've been scratched.
We all saw it.

550
00:34:14.443 --> 00:34:15.879
We know you're gonna turn
into one of 'em.

551
00:34:16.054 --> 00:34:18.099
You come out here.
be a man about it.

552
00:34:20.841 --> 00:34:22.495
- LOUIE: You already got
what you came for.

553
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:24.453
So. just leave me alone already.

554
00:34:24.627 --> 00:34:26.847
- Either you open this door
or I will break it down. Louie.

555
00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.459
- Bernie?
- I will break this door down!

556
00:34:30.633 --> 00:34:31.982
- Sterling.

557
00:34:32.157 --> 00:34:33.375
Leave him!

558
00:34:35.508 --> 00:34:39.599
[engine starts]

559
00:34:39.773 --> 00:34:40.991
- Aah.

560
00:34:48.347 --> 00:34:49.130
[tires screeches]

561
00:34:49.304 --> 00:34:50.349
- What the fuck?

562
00:35:08.715 --> 00:35:09.629
- Might as well move on.

563
00:35:09.803 --> 00:35:11.326
They already cleared me out.

564
00:35:21.989 --> 00:35:24.905
Tell your friends to get their
hands off me please!

565
00:35:25.079 --> 00:35:27.647
Aah! What the fuck do I have
to do to get everybody

566
00:35:27.821 --> 00:35:29.344
to just leave me
the hell alone. huh?

567
00:35:29.518 --> 00:35:31.564
I don't have
anything left to take.

568
00:35:31.738 --> 00:35:33.000
Gruber took it all.

569
00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:35.437
- Yeah.

570
00:35:36.917 --> 00:35:38.875
Looks like we're a little late
to the party.

571
00:35:40.703 --> 00:35:42.444
A hep do that?

572
00:35:42.618 --> 00:35:44.229
- Oh. you must have been top
of your class at the academy!

573
00:35:44.403 --> 00:35:46.535
No actually.
a horse did this.

574
00:35:46.709 --> 00:35:48.537
See I had a big fruit basket
on my head

575
00:35:48.711 --> 00:35:50.278
and he thought it was
a fucking apple.

576
00:35:50.452 --> 00:35:52.062
Of course.
it was a fuckin' hep.

577
00:35:52.237 --> 00:35:54.674
Who else attacks people
except you fucking rednecks.

578
00:35:54.848 --> 00:35:57.329
At least. the heps
don't steal my shit!

579
00:35:57.503 --> 00:35:59.461
I am so sick
and tired of you guys

580
00:35:59.635 --> 00:36:02.203
just doing whatever you want.
as if there's no consequences

581
00:36:02.377 --> 00:36:03.726
what so all you--

582
00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.815
you bust into my office.
you push me around.

583
00:36:05.989 --> 00:36:07.948
you treat me like
a sack of shit.

584
00:36:17.087 --> 00:36:23.442
[dramatic music]

585
00:36:23.616 --> 00:36:25.270
- STERLING: I feel sorta bad
for those hillbillies.

586
00:36:25.444 --> 00:36:28.186
just blindly following Gruber.

587
00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:30.623
That grunt doesn't know his ass
from a hole in the ground.

588
00:36:30.797 --> 00:36:32.190
[men chuckling]

589
00:37:02.829 --> 00:37:04.831
[horn honking]

590
00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:22.718
- Alright. ladies.

591
00:37:22.892 --> 00:37:24.154
Let's see you all inside.

592
00:37:27.462 --> 00:37:28.420
- You okay?

593
00:37:29.986 --> 00:37:31.727
- I never thought
I'd see this place again.

594
00:37:35.296 --> 00:37:37.298
- Don't worry.

595
00:37:37.472 --> 00:37:39.996
Everyone here wants
the same thing you do.

596
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:41.563
a safe place to sleep.

597
00:37:43.086 --> 00:37:44.784
Hey. Diane!

598
00:37:44.958 --> 00:37:46.133
Why don't you go fetch
that wheelchair

599
00:37:46.307 --> 00:37:48.266
and help these two inside?

600
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:49.963
And show 'em to
a room over by you.

601
00:37:52.922 --> 00:37:56.404
Listen. once you get settled.
why don't you come find me?

602
00:37:56.578 --> 00:37:59.494
We need to have a...
little chat.

603
00:38:02.889 --> 00:38:04.586
- DIANE: Sorry. it's not such
a warm welcome.

604
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:07.415
Most everyone is out
getting things or

605
00:38:07.589 --> 00:38:10.679
trying to gather up folks
who haven't got the bug yet.

606
00:38:10.853 --> 00:38:14.814
Uh. well. uh down there.
there's supplies.

607
00:38:14.988 --> 00:38:17.425
and storage.
and-- and things. and...

608
00:38:17.599 --> 00:38:18.948
and past that.
that's the end bay.

609
00:38:19.122 --> 00:38:22.038
where most everyone else
has their room set up.

610
00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.739
Y'all roomies?

611
00:38:26.913 --> 00:38:28.523
- Yeah.

612
00:38:28.697 --> 00:38:30.264
Ever since college.

613
00:38:30.438 --> 00:38:32.614
- My sister had five roommates.

614
00:38:32.788 --> 00:38:34.529
[Diane chuckles]
With the ROTC.

615
00:38:34.703 --> 00:38:35.922
I used to tell her all the time.
I don't know

616
00:38:36.096 --> 00:38:37.184
how she lived
with that many people.

617
00:38:38.707 --> 00:38:40.143
Imagine what she would think

618
00:38:40.318 --> 00:38:42.624
seeing me living with
all of these folks now

619
00:38:42.798 --> 00:38:44.104
if she was still alive.

620
00:38:48.195 --> 00:38:50.458
I just want you to know
I am super grateful

621
00:38:50.632 --> 00:38:52.591
your dad was so prepared

622
00:38:52.765 --> 00:38:55.245
and has let me here
with the others.

623
00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:58.553
And I can't ever repay him
enough for it.

624
00:39:04.907 --> 00:39:06.735
- Um. ok-- okay.

625
00:39:09.956 --> 00:39:11.479
- Of course.
this is the common area.

626
00:39:12.872 --> 00:39:14.787
We've been having family meals.

627
00:39:17.137 --> 00:39:18.791
DIANE:
It's a God send. I think.

628
00:39:18.965 --> 00:39:22.621
A couple times day
where we can feel almost normal.

629
00:39:23.883 --> 00:39:25.014
- Bitch...

630
00:39:26.886 --> 00:39:28.191
Ah.

631
00:39:29.628 --> 00:39:31.369
What the fuck you looking at?

632
00:39:32.935 --> 00:39:33.980
- DIANE: You okay?

633
00:39:34.154 --> 00:39:35.373
- Oh yeah.
- Did I say something to

634
00:39:35.547 --> 00:39:37.418
upset you?
- No. no. You're--

635
00:39:37.592 --> 00:39:38.811
you're fine.

636
00:39:38.985 --> 00:39:40.290
I-- I um...

637
00:39:41.770 --> 00:39:42.815
I'm fine.

638
00:39:44.991 --> 00:39:46.253
Big John and the boys
put us all together

639
00:39:46.427 --> 00:39:48.037
a couple of days ago.

640
00:39:48.211 --> 00:39:50.910
It's rustic. but comfy.

641
00:39:51.084 --> 00:39:52.085
Here we are.

642
00:39:52.259 --> 00:39:54.043
Home sweet home.

643
00:39:54.217 --> 00:39:55.044
This will be your room.

644
00:39:55.218 --> 00:39:56.481
Uh. mine is just

645
00:39:56.655 --> 00:39:57.569
next door here.
- Yeah.

646
00:39:58.744 --> 00:40:00.746
[Alex coughs]

647
00:40:02.443 --> 00:40:04.924
- We're pretty lucky though.
Over here.

648
00:40:05.098 --> 00:40:07.187
there's a little more room
for those of us that.

649
00:40:07.361 --> 00:40:08.928
need a little more privacy.

650
00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.847
- Who is this
handsome young man?

651
00:40:15.021 --> 00:40:16.152
- Andrew. yeah.

652
00:40:16.326 --> 00:40:18.285
Can you say hi to Miss Alex?

653
00:40:20.766 --> 00:40:22.420
Andrew. come back here!
- It's okay.

654
00:40:23.638 --> 00:40:24.857
Maybe later.

655
00:40:25.031 --> 00:40:27.381
- He's just so timid.

656
00:40:28.774 --> 00:40:30.297
- I think that's normal
for his age.

657
00:40:31.864 --> 00:40:33.735
- I'll let you all get settled.

658
00:40:33.909 --> 00:40:35.128
Get you a fresh shirt.

659
00:40:35.302 --> 00:40:36.477
- Thank you.

660
00:40:40.568 --> 00:40:42.004
[sighs]

661
00:40:44.703 --> 00:40:45.878
Roommates?

662
00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.447
- We are not safe here.

663
00:40:49.621 --> 00:40:50.578
- I'm not going to lie
about being--

664
00:40:50.752 --> 00:40:52.319
- Alex. listen to me.

665
00:40:52.493 --> 00:40:54.190
You don't understand
these people.

666
00:40:54.364 --> 00:40:55.975
- You mean the people
who saved us?

667
00:40:58.281 --> 00:40:59.848
- I'm just saying.

668
00:41:00.022 --> 00:41:01.981
don't go assuming you trust
every smile you see.

669
00:41:02.155 --> 00:41:04.331
- I'm just saying why do you
have to always assume

670
00:41:04.505 --> 00:41:06.246
that people won't do
the right thing?

671
00:41:11.077 --> 00:41:12.034
- Experience.

672
00:41:12.208 --> 00:41:19.651
[ominous music]

673
00:41:23.916 --> 00:41:25.091
- Do you think he's here?

674
00:41:27.397 --> 00:41:28.877
- I'm gonna go find him.

675
00:41:29.051 --> 00:41:30.836
- I'll come with you.
- No. You stay here.

676
00:41:31.010 --> 00:41:32.446
I don't want you to
have to go by yourself.

677
00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:35.275
- He is my father.
and I will take care of it.

678
00:41:38.365 --> 00:41:42.064
I'm-- I'm just gonna
get cleaned up and

679
00:41:44.545 --> 00:41:45.415
you just rest.

680
00:41:49.071 --> 00:41:50.638
- Be happy you know
you got your wish.

681
00:41:52.161 --> 00:41:54.512
I completely regret
ever taking this trip.

682
00:42:22.365 --> 00:42:23.889
- Jamie. hi!

683
00:42:24.063 --> 00:42:25.673
It's funny.
I was just coming to find you.

684
00:42:27.370 --> 00:42:28.676
- I want...

685
00:42:32.288 --> 00:42:33.333
Is my dad in there?

686
00:42:35.465 --> 00:42:36.554
[sighs]

687
00:42:38.033 --> 00:42:39.339
- I need you to brace yourself.

688
00:42:44.083 --> 00:42:45.911
He was in a bad way
when I found him.

689
00:42:47.913 --> 00:42:49.479
He's in quite a bit of pain.

690
00:42:51.743 --> 00:42:53.396
Keeled over in the work bay.

691
00:42:56.312 --> 00:42:58.750
I locked him in here

692
00:42:58.924 --> 00:43:01.013
and did everything
I could think of.

693
00:43:02.667 --> 00:43:04.277
But he...

694
00:43:04.451 --> 00:43:05.800
He just kept getting worse.

695
00:43:08.194 --> 00:43:12.328
In the end. he had the strength
to do what I didn't.

696
00:43:15.854 --> 00:43:18.596
He had a gun room in here
I didn't know about.

697
00:43:21.729 --> 00:43:23.078
ROBERT: [shouting]

698
00:43:23.252 --> 00:43:24.253
GRUBER:
Found him yesterday morning.

699
00:43:25.733 --> 00:43:27.430
ROBERT:
[indistinct speech]

700
00:43:32.827 --> 00:43:34.089
- Bullshit!

701
00:43:34.263 --> 00:43:37.919
You're doing this shit
in my house!

702
00:43:38.093 --> 00:43:40.487
Who the fuck--
the fuck do you think you are?

703
00:43:48.364 --> 00:43:49.583
- We all owe him everything.

704
00:43:51.019 --> 00:43:52.368
If it wasn't for him
raising the alarm

705
00:43:52.542 --> 00:43:53.718
and getting us moving.

706
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:57.635
I don't think most of us
would still be here now.

707
00:44:11.387 --> 00:44:12.345
Your father.

708
00:44:14.608 --> 00:44:17.655
he was kind of my only friend
when I was in really dark place.

709
00:44:20.179 --> 00:44:23.399
Told me a little bit
about your uh. condition.

710
00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:29.188
And how he reacted when you
shared that news with him.

711
00:44:32.452 --> 00:44:33.540
I want you to know
I told him that

712
00:44:33.714 --> 00:44:35.281
he was wrong to do that.

713
00:44:37.109 --> 00:44:39.067
and he should be supporting you
no matter what.

714
00:44:47.293 --> 00:44:48.511
- I bet he took that well.

715
00:44:50.122 --> 00:44:51.863
- He didn't talk to me much
after that.

716
00:44:54.387 --> 00:44:56.998
I don't claim to be an expert
in these things. but

717

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:57.142
But you can lay
your heads down proud.

899
00:58:57.316 --> 00:58:59.753
Proud that you can reap
the fruits of your own labor.

900
00:58:59.927 --> 00:59:00.841
- WOMAN 1: Hell yeah!
- WOMAN 2: Oh yeah!

901
00:59:01.015 --> 00:59:03.452
[group cheering]

902
00:59:03.627 --> 00:59:06.760
- The days and weeks ahead
will be harder still.

903
00:59:06.934 --> 00:59:08.545
But we all here are a team.

904
00:59:09.807 --> 00:59:13.288
And we live. sleep. eat.

905
00:59:13.462 --> 00:59:15.116
fight as a team.

[whistling]

908
00:59:18.685 --> 00:59:22.210
The bureaucrats say
they want you to rely on them.

909
00:59:22.384 --> 00:59:23.560
That they're gonna
come help you.

910
00:59:24.865 --> 00:59:26.040
That's a lot of horse dung.

911
00:59:27.389 --> 00:59:29.348
Now is the time to have faith.

912
00:59:30.828 --> 00:59:32.090
The faith in yourselves.

913
00:59:33.439 --> 00:59:36.573
More importantly.
faith in your neighbors.

914
00:59:39.401 --> 00:59:40.620
We're all a family.

915
00:59:42.622 --> 00:59:44.406
And I know we can rely
on each other

916
00:59:44.581 --> 00:59:46.060
to do what's necessary to keep

917
00:59:46.234 --> 00:59:48.454
this family safe.

[group cheering. whistling]

919
00:59:50.064 --> 00:59:51.500
That's right. Big John.

920
00:59:53.372 --> 00:59:54.721
- Thirty years from now.

921
00:59:54.895 --> 00:59:56.767
when you're sitting
in front of the fire

922
00:59:56.941 --> 00:59:59.291
with your grandson
on your lap.

923
00:59:59.465 --> 01:00:01.554
these will be the days
you tell him about.

924
01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:05.689
Our founding fathers knew that--

925
01:00:05.863 --> 01:00:06.690
- MAN 1: Hey John...

926
01:00:06.864 --> 01:00:11.042
[indistinct chatter]

927
01:00:11.216 --> 01:00:12.521
- Tater. Bernie.
get your equipment.

928
01:00:12.696 --> 01:00:14.306
Turn the perimeter lights on.

929
01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:18.005
Keep them at a safe distance.

930
01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:22.096
Sterling and his crew are here
saying they wanna trade.

931
01:00:23.707 --> 01:00:25.360
We don't know how dangerous
these men can be.

932
01:00:25.534 --> 01:00:28.407
Stay alert. and everybody to
your positions. Let's move!

933
01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:32.933
[indistinct chatter]

934
01:00:33.107 --> 01:00:33.934
Hurry up. fellas.

935
01:00:35.153 --> 01:00:37.024
- Big John. what's going on?

936
01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:39.679
- Everything will be fine.

937
01:00:41.072 --> 01:00:43.509
Just keep calm.
stay back here.

938
01:00:43.683 --> 01:00:44.989
Okay?

939
01:00:45.163 --> 01:00:47.165
- On it now.

940
01:00:47.339 --> 01:00:50.516
You gonna take this here.
Just like we practiced. okay?

941
01:00:50.690 --> 01:00:52.083
This here's your spot.

942
01:00:52.257 --> 01:00:53.824
Nothing should happen.

943
01:00:53.998 --> 01:00:56.435
But you just keep your eyes
on the back door here.

944
01:00:56.609 --> 01:00:59.743
Anyone tries to get in.
you pull that trigger. alright?

945
01:01:02.484 --> 01:01:04.486
Don't hesitate. okay?

946
01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.097
Alright. go get 'em. buddy.

947
01:01:18.457 --> 01:01:19.937
- Alright. open the perimeter.

948
01:01:20.111 --> 01:01:21.590
Let 'em inside the outer walls.

949
01:01:31.557 --> 01:01:32.819
- Time to show 'em
what you're made of.

950
01:01:32.993 --> 01:01:34.081
Boy! Get over here!

951
01:01:34.255 --> 01:01:35.779
Come on!
- Calm down.

952
01:01:35.953 --> 01:01:37.171
Everything's gonna be fine.

953
01:01:37.345 --> 01:01:38.869
Just stay vigilant
in that corner.

954
01:01:39.043 --> 01:01:40.871
- Alright. Big John. I'm ready.
- Let's do this.

955
01:01:41.045 --> 01:01:42.089
- Hey. get back down
to your station

956
01:01:42.263 --> 01:01:43.830
on the other end.

957
01:01:44.004 --> 01:01:46.659
- But I figured you'd want me
back here with you.

958
01:01:46.833 --> 01:01:48.879
- You figured wrong.
Your post is the back roll top.

959
01:01:49.053 --> 01:01:50.315
Now get back down there.
- Well. I'm telling you.

960
01:01:50.489 --> 01:01:52.056
it's all locked
and loaded back there.

961
01:01:52.230 --> 01:01:53.274
- I don't want to hear about it.
Get back to your station.

962
01:01:53.448 --> 01:01:54.711
- You don't trust me!

963
01:01:57.757 --> 01:01:58.932
It's all secure.

964
01:02:01.108 --> 01:02:03.023
Now you're gonna want your
best guns down here

965
01:02:03.197 --> 01:02:05.373
front and center
where the action is.

966
01:02:05.547 --> 01:02:06.853
And that's where I belong.

967
01:02:10.161 --> 01:02:11.249
- Alright.

968
01:02:13.077 --> 01:02:14.382
- Alright.

[door rattling]

970
01:02:32.226 --> 01:02:33.532
- John...

971
01:02:36.056 --> 01:02:38.363
You gonna let me stand out here
like a beggar?

972
01:03:03.040 --> 01:03:06.826
- Why don't you just come back
in daylight hours. say noon.

973
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.306
we'd be more than happy
to trade.

974
01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.003
- Afraid I can't do that. John.

975
01:03:11.265 --> 01:03:14.051
Not since you took all the gas.

976
01:03:14.225 --> 01:03:16.009
- We took the fuel. because you
raided the grocery store.

977
01:03:16.183 --> 01:03:18.577
- We have a young man
with a real bad fever.

978
01:03:21.145 --> 01:03:22.581
The vet office
is pretty picked over

979
01:03:22.755 --> 01:03:24.191
when we got there. too.

980
01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:29.631
But.

981
01:03:31.285 --> 01:03:33.200
I'm not here
to split hairs.

982
01:03:37.204 --> 01:03:38.553
We're here to trade.

[tense music]

984
01:03:55.092 --> 01:03:55.962

985
01:03:57.268 --> 01:03:58.399
- What you got?

986
01:03:58.573 --> 01:04:01.098
- Don't jerk me around.
Sterling.

987
01:04:01.272 --> 01:04:02.708
You got us out here
in the middle of the night.

988
01:04:04.275 --> 01:04:06.799

you around. John.

[door opens]

990
01:04:19.943 --> 01:04:20.900

Antibiotics. pills.

994
01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:33.957
- We can't afford to part
with any of our meds.

995
01:04:34.131 --> 01:04:35.828
I got too many families here.

996
01:04:42.052 --> 01:04:43.227
- MASKED MAN 1:
Go. go. go. go...

997

did you get that tingle?

1030
01:06:36.644 --> 01:06:37.906

That's your responsibility!

1037
01:06:47.264 --> 01:06:48.743
- What the hell
is wrong with you?

1038
01:06:48.917 --> 01:06:49.875
- He let them--
he let 'em walk right past him!

1039

He just let 'em walk right in

1040

- You okay. son?

1041
01:07:00.146 --> 01:07:01.800
It's okay to be scared.

1042
01:07:04.063 --> 01:07:07.414
And sometimes we have to do
things we don't want.

1043
01:07:08.763 --> 01:07:09.851
things...

1044
01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:15.640
we never dreamed
to keep people safe.

1045

[Diane pants]

1062
01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:00.511
I need time to think.

1063
01:08:00.685 --> 01:08:02.339
- Ain't no thinking to be done.

1064
01:08:02.513 --> 01:08:04.341
It's like you been saying.

"Room for doubt
equals room for death".

1066

[coughing]

1071
01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:24.274
- There ain't no reason
you need to do this. Big John.

1072
01:08:24.448 --> 01:08:25.927
Tater and I can take care
of this for you.

1073
01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:27.146

You're gonna be okay.
You have to...

You have to believe that.

Ladies and gentlemen.

1334
01:25:06.144 --> 01:25:07.798
as of 10:00 a.m. this morning.

1335
01:25:07.972 --> 01:25:10.192
my office
is pleased to announce.

1336
01:25:10.366 --> 01:25:13.195
that the outbreak has been
mostly contained in our state.

1337
01:25:14.979 --> 01:25:16.763
Statistically.
the events of the past week

1338
01:25:16.937 --> 01:25:18.809
have been the most significant
in the generation.

1339
01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:22.247
What started out
as a localized outbreak.

1340
01:25:22.421 --> 01:25:26.121
quickly spread.
prompting a statewide emergency.

1341
01:25:26.295 --> 01:25:29.994
The National Guard was deployed.
as were the Army reserves

1342
01:25:30.168 --> 01:25:33.215
in an effort to contain
infected individuals

1343
01:25:33.389 --> 01:25:34.825
and suppress local militias.

1344
01:25:36.609 --> 01:25:39.525
I'd like to thank our military
as well as our first responders

1345
01:25:39.699 --> 01:25:42.137
for the sacrifices
they have made for us

1346
01:25:42.311 --> 01:25:44.574
over the course of this event.

1347
01:25:45.966 --> 01:25:47.490
It was touchy for a while.

1348
01:25:48.969 --> 01:25:51.189
But I believe this shows
the strength of America.

1349
01:25:52.712 --> 01:25:54.714
How we can band together
in times of distinct need

1350
01:25:56.325 --> 01:26:00.329
and do what is necessary
to overcome any obstacle.

1351
01:26:00.503 --> 01:26:03.767
any challenge. any hardship.
[gun shot]

1352
01:26:15.648 --> 01:26:17.215
- Ms. Miller. I wanted to
give you an update

1353
01:26:17.389 --> 01:26:19.086
before we go into surgery.

1354
01:26:19.261 --> 01:26:22.177
Alex has a grade three
splenic laceration

1355
01:26:22.351 --> 01:26:24.396
and likely a few broken ribs.

1356
01:26:24.570 --> 01:26:26.093
A CT scan revealed

1357
01:26:26.268 --> 01:26:28.531
that the bullet stopped just
short of her spinal cord

1358
01:26:28.705 --> 01:26:30.054
and the good news is
that it didn't appear

1359
01:26:30.228 --> 01:26:31.447
to enter her chest cavity.

1360
01:26:31.621 --> 01:26:32.926
So. it didn't hit her heart.
her lungs

1361
01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:35.190
or any of the arteries
in her abdomen.

1362
01:26:35.364 --> 01:26:37.104
I'm gonna go in.
I'm gonna remove the bullet.

1363
01:26:37.279 --> 01:26:40.107
I'm gonna pack the spleen
and we'll proceed from there.

1364
01:26:40.282 --> 01:26:42.980
- Doctor. um...

1365
01:26:43.154 --> 01:26:44.677
You should know that she was...

1366
01:26:46.462 --> 01:26:48.638
She was scratched
by an infected person.

1367
01:26:48.812 --> 01:26:50.205
- Miss Miller. I saw the wound.

1368
01:26:51.554 --> 01:26:53.077
- We can go--
- Miss Miller--

1369
01:26:53.251 --> 01:26:55.645
- Just don't say anything
and I'll take her if--

1370
01:26:55.819 --> 01:26:57.516
- We treated the infection.

1371
01:26:57.690 --> 01:26:59.910
which can be quite serious
if left untreated

1372
01:27:00.084 --> 01:27:01.433
for a long period of time.

1373
01:27:01.607 --> 01:27:04.044
But in Miss Kanai's case.
we caught it early

1374
01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:05.916
and she's responding
to the treatment.

1375
01:27:06.090 --> 01:27:07.483
At this point.
I'm much more concerned

1376
01:27:07.657 --> 01:27:09.224
about the damage to her spleen.

1377
01:27:09.398 --> 01:27:10.660
I'll-- I'll be back with you
as soon as I can

1378
01:27:10.834 --> 01:27:12.096
with another update.

1379
01:27:17.928 --> 01:27:21.323
[indistinct chatter
in background]

1380
01:27:25.588 --> 01:27:27.242
- Lex?

1381
01:27:27.416 --> 01:27:28.504
Hey.

1382
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:31.637
- [sighs]
- Oh. Easy. here.

1383
01:27:31.811 --> 01:27:34.466
The doctor said
if it hurts to push this.

1384
01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:36.381
And it'll release
more painkillers.

1385
01:27:41.952 --> 01:27:42.996
That better?

1386
01:27:46.783 --> 01:27:48.828
- We need one of these for home.

1387
01:27:53.964 --> 01:27:55.966
How long have I...

1388
01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:57.359
- Couple of days.

1389
01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:01.972
Oh no. don't worry.

1390
01:28:02.146 --> 01:28:03.452
It was treatable.

1391
01:28:06.846 --> 01:28:07.804
Yeah.

1392
01:28:09.806 --> 01:28:11.938
Another day or so.
and we can go home.

1393
01:28:14.724 --> 01:28:16.291
Here. they said your throat
might hurt.

1394
01:28:19.511 --> 01:28:21.426
[chuckles]

1395
01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.515
Okay.
How about something cool?

1396
01:28:23.689 --> 01:28:24.777
Ice cream?

1397
01:28:24.951 --> 01:28:26.301
[sighs]

1398
01:28:27.911 --> 01:28:29.391
Yeah.

1399
01:28:29.565 --> 01:28:31.218
- TATER:
Well. they kicked my damn door.

1400
01:28:31.393 --> 01:28:34.091
And they confiscated
every single gun that I own.

1401
01:28:34.265 --> 01:28:35.571
They didn't knock or nothing.

1402
01:28:37.616 --> 01:28:38.835
- Let me see
if I can go get some.

1403
01:28:41.881 --> 01:28:43.230
- BERNIE: Yeah. me too.

1404
01:28:43.405 --> 01:28:44.841
Took a search warrant
to my mom's house.

1405
01:28:45.015 --> 01:28:46.799
Broke half her damn
Precious Moments Figurines

1406

trying to move the false wall
to get in to my gun room.

1407
01:28:52.022 --> 01:28:53.371
I was like.

1408
01:28:53.545 --> 01:28:55.373
"I don't why
you're so mad at us?

1409
01:28:55.547 --> 01:28:57.897
We basically just did your job
for you. Mr. Government."

1410
01:28:58.071 --> 01:28:59.290
- TATER: Hmm.

1411
01:28:59.464 --> 01:29:01.597
- They was talking about
jail time.

1412
01:29:01.771 --> 01:29:03.250
talking about pressing charges

1413
01:29:03.425 --> 01:29:05.601
until I told 'em it was
all Big John's idea.

1414
01:29:05.775 --> 01:29:07.646
- Yeah. I said the same thing.

1415
01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:10.301
They made me write it down.
make it all official and shit.

1416
01:29:10.475 --> 01:29:12.390
- TATER: Hmm.
- I said. "Sir.

1417
01:29:12.564 --> 01:29:13.826
"How many times
you gonna ask me

1418
01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.741
the same question
over and over again?"

1419
01:29:15.915 --> 01:29:17.308
- TATER: I was in there
for damn near an hour.

1420
01:29:17.482 --> 01:29:19.658
- Mm-hmm. I told him...

1421
01:29:19.832 --> 01:29:21.225
I told him. "I know my rights."

1422
01:29:21.399 --> 01:29:22.792
- Hmm.
- "I'm allowed by the

1423
01:29:22.966 --> 01:29:25.969
constitution to protect myself
and my property."

1424
01:29:26.143 --> 01:29:27.405
Got all red in the face.

1425
01:29:27.579 --> 01:29:28.928
He didn't know what to do
with that. so.

1426
01:29:29.102 --> 01:29:31.670
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. careful now.
you'll wake him.

1427
01:29:31.844 --> 01:29:33.106
- Him?

1428
01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.108
No. don't worry about him.

1429
01:29:35.282 --> 01:29:37.023
He's practically a vegetable.
doctor said.

1430
01:29:38.024 --> 01:29:39.243
- Oh...

1431
01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:42.115
Big John...

1432
01:29:43.595 --> 01:29:44.857
Hell. that's a shame.

1433
01:29:46.032 --> 01:29:47.251
- Yep.

1434
01:29:47.425 --> 01:29:48.513
Sure is.

1435
01:29:50.472 --> 01:29:53.257
Problem is we didn't come out

1436
01:29:53.431 --> 01:29:55.172
hard enough on day one.

1437

negotiating to be done

when you're looking down
the wrong end of a bolt action.

- No. you can't do it.

1445
01:30:14.452 --> 01:30:15.453
- Hmm.

1446
01:30:15.627 --> 01:30:16.889

It is so good to be home.

1451
01:30:25.158 --> 01:30:26.812
- Alex. I...

1452
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:30.294
I want to say...

1453
01:30:30.468 --> 01:30:31.817
- I know.
- No.

1454
01:30:31.991 --> 01:30:34.124
Uh. please let me say this.

1455
01:30:36.343 --> 01:30:40.435
I haven't been myself
after Ally.

1456
01:30:42.524 --> 01:30:46.310
I got twisted up.
and I had to find a way to...

1457
01:30:49.792 --> 01:30:53.752
I felt like-- like I was...

1458
01:30:53.926 --> 01:30:55.232
- Like you were trapped?

1459
01:30:57.103 --> 01:31:01.325
- It felt like
all I could try was to run.

1460
01:31:01.499 --> 01:31:04.589
Like. I've always been running.

1461
01:31:05.982 --> 01:31:09.202

from the only person

who ever made me feel...

1463
01:31:13.685 --> 01:31:14.904
normal.

1464
01:31:17.036 --> 01:31:19.691
But it doesn't matter
where I go.

1465
01:31:19.865 --> 01:31:22.085
It's not about getting away
or going somewhere else.

1466
01:31:22.259 --> 01:31:24.957
It's about
where you choose to be.

1467
01:31:26.916 --> 01:31:28.744
And I choose to be here.

1468
