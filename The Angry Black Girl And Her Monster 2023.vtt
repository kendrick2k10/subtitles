3
00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:37.437
Death is a disease.

4
00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:17.745
I heard my mom's heart stop
when I was 8.

5
00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:22.215
My mom's last heartbeat.

6
00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.493
A few more years and she
would have been a doctor.

7
00:01:35.462 --> 00:01:38.833
A five-year plan broken
with the one bullet.

8
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.710
The disease spread.

9
00:01:50.912 --> 00:01:53.548
It infected my brother. Chris.

10
00:01:56.684 --> 00:01:59.621
He grew up and started banging
with Kango.

11
00:02:16.771 --> 00:02:18.740
I thought that'd be the last
of it.

12
00:02:23.276 --> 00:02:25.713
To support us.
my dad is a mechanic in the day

13
00:02:25.747 --> 00:02:27.782
and security at night.

14
00:02:35.957 --> 00:02:39.192
He started showing symptoms
after my brother died.

15
00:02:49.737 --> 00:02:53.841
Death is the disease
that broke my family.

16
00:03:00.948 --> 00:03:02.684
I'm sick of seeing it.

17
00:03:08.556 --> 00:03:10.525
My hypothesis.

18
00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:16.898
If death is a disease...

19
00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:23.738
...then there's a cure.

20
00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:31.813
And I'm gonna find it.

21
00:03:56.704 --> 00:03:58.472
Fuck.

22
00:05:15.516 --> 00:05:18.553
The Mad Scientist!

23
00:05:19.386 --> 00:05:22.355
The Mad Scientist!

24
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:26.527
-How'd I get that name?
-H!

25
00:05:27.427 --> 00:05:28.796
Um...

26
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.865
H. Come on. You know it.

27
00:05:30.898 --> 00:05:32.934
-H?
-Yes.

28
00:05:32.967 --> 00:05:34.068
Oh.
Hydrogen.

29
00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:36.537
- Yes.
- Yeah?

30
00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:37.738
Co.

31
00:05:37.772 --> 00:05:39.941
Co.

32
00:05:39.974 --> 00:05:41.876
Oh. that's a --
I don't know Co.

33
00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:43.744
Um...

34
00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:44.912
-Cobalt.
-Yes!

35
00:05:44.946 --> 00:05:46.914
Yeah?
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

36
00:05:46.948 --> 00:05:49.884
Hey. yo. V.
When you coming through?

37
00:05:49.917 --> 00:05:51.118
Uh. this afternoon.

38
00:05:51.152 --> 00:05:52.787
Oh. all right.

39
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.022
Yo. you tell her to call me
The Mad Scientist?

40
00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:58.726
I don't know nothing about that.
Jada. we got to go soon.

41
00:05:58.759 --> 00:06:01.762
Can't you see?
I'm busy.

42
00:06:01.796 --> 00:06:03.531
Pt.

43
00:06:03.898 --> 00:06:05.566
Uh. platinum.

44
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.767
Sg.

45
00:06:06.801 --> 00:06:08.870
- Seaborgium.
- Ti.

46
00:06:08.903 --> 00:06:10.171
Titanium.

47
00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:13.440
Help me with my homework again.

48
00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:14.976
Ca.

49
00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:16.644
Calcium.

50
00:06:18.478 --> 00:06:20.380
Got you.

51
00:06:21.015 --> 00:06:21.983
Aah!

52
00:06:22.016 --> 00:06:23.651
Got you!

53
00:06:35.196 --> 00:06:37.565
I won!

54
00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:43.671
- Little homey.
- What's up?

55
00:06:43.704 --> 00:06:45.806
What up. though?

56
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.974
Champ. what's good?

57
00:06:47.008 --> 00:06:49.476
- Cm.
- Curium.

58
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.145
U.

59
00:06:51.178 --> 00:06:53.714
Um...Hmm.

60
00:06:53.748 --> 00:06:55.716
Do I have to give you
the answer?

61
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.218
- Uranium.
- Yes.

62
00:06:57.251 --> 00:06:58.519
Hey. yo!

63
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.693
Kango-head ass.
Yerr.

64
00:07:05.726 --> 00:07:07.094
What up. Jamaal?

65
00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:11.933
Curt. what's good?

66
00:07:17.705 --> 00:07:19.740
Yeah. We got that work.

67
00:07:23.744 --> 00:07:25.780
Yo. Curt. go grab that.

68
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:58.612
- I.
- Iodine.

69
00:07:58.646 --> 00:08:01.048
- Fe.
- Iron.

70
00:08:01.082 --> 00:08:02.283
Cr.

71
00:08:02.316 --> 00:08:04.618
Mm.
I don't know that one.

72
00:08:04.652 --> 00:08:05.820
Which one?

73
00:08:05.853 --> 00:08:08.255
-Cr.
-Cr.

74
00:08:08.289 --> 00:08:11.525
Uh...
Can you give me a hint?

75
00:08:12.159 --> 00:08:15.863
I don't really know
how to give you a hint.

76
00:08:15.896 --> 00:08:17.732
The only hint I can give you
is --

77
00:08:17.765 --> 00:08:19.700
Oh. wait. I got it.
Chromium.

78
00:08:19.734 --> 00:08:21.836
-Right?
-Yes!

79
00:08:21.869 --> 00:08:23.304
How do you know all this?

80
00:08:23.337 --> 00:08:27.908
It's because I study great minds
like Valerie Thomas.

81
00:08:27.942 --> 00:08:29.677
Who's that?

82
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:32.747
Well. she's a physicist
that invented --

83
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.315
Shoot.

84
00:08:34.348 --> 00:08:37.985
She's a physicist that invented
the illusion transmitter.

85
00:08:38.019 --> 00:08:41.088
a mechanism that simulates
a 3-D viewing of an object

86
00:08:41.122 --> 00:08:44.692
using optical illusions
with parabolic mirrors at NASA.

87
00:08:44.725 --> 00:08:47.261
Tell your sister to tell you
about Alice H. Parker.

88
00:08:47.294 --> 00:08:48.996
the inventor of central heating.

89
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.999
Or Sister Rosetta Tharpe.
the inventor of rock 'n' roll.

90
00:08:52.033 --> 00:08:54.969
Do you think you're smart 'cause
you go to that white school?

91
00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:58.939
Well. that white school is smart
because I go there.

92
00:09:00.007 --> 00:09:03.344
They only talk about Einstein
and Edison at school.

93
00:09:03.377 --> 00:09:05.279
Maybe that's because we need
better schools.

94
00:09:05.312 --> 00:09:07.982
It's not like Edison
invented shit.

95
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.318
Learn from the greats.

96
00:09:11.352 --> 00:09:12.920
All of them.

97
00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:14.889
Not some dude who just watches
people make ideas

98
00:09:14.922 --> 00:09:16.157
and then patents them.

99
00:09:22.363 --> 00:09:24.665
Test me later.

100
00:09:24.698 --> 00:09:28.169
You have ketchup
on your glasses.

101
00:09:49.223 --> 00:09:52.059
No. No. no.
Jerome. no!

102
00:09:52.093 --> 00:09:53.694
Open the door.

103
00:09:54.328 --> 00:09:55.696
-What's the code?
-Go on.

104
00:09:55.729 --> 00:09:57.198
No. No.
Come on.

105
00:09:57.231 --> 00:09:59.633
-What's the code?
-So you're not late for school.

106
00:09:59.667 --> 00:10:01.368
I'm serious.
I don't want your mom tripping.

107
00:10:01.402 --> 00:10:03.904
Don't worry about her.
And what's that smell? Hey!

108
00:10:03.938 --> 00:10:07.074
Hey.
Who did that to you?

109
00:10:07.108 --> 00:10:08.109
Hmm?

110
00:10:08.142 --> 00:10:09.810
Don't worry about it.

111
00:10:09.844 --> 00:10:12.046
I'll make his heartbeat stop.

112
00:10:12.079 --> 00:10:14.248
You know what happens
when a heartbeat stops?

113
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:15.783
He stops breathing?

114
00:10:15.816 --> 00:10:17.718
Oxygen in your blood
doesn't reach the brain.

115
00:10:17.751 --> 00:10:19.386
The brain fails in minutes.
resulting in death.

116
00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:20.988
Say you hit the head.

117
00:10:21.021 --> 00:10:22.823
The brain controls
all functions of the body.

118
00:10:22.857 --> 00:10:25.359
Destruction of the frontal lobe
inhibits all personality.

119
00:10:25.392 --> 00:10:27.161
body movement. and intelligence.

120
00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:30.231
All sense of touch. vision.
hearing. and memory vanish.

121
00:10:30.264 --> 00:10:32.967
Who wants to know
all the different ways to die?

122
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.402
Life is cheap.
You know that.

123
00:10:36.437 --> 00:10:37.872
Do you really want to know

124
00:10:37.905 --> 00:10:39.406
I know all the ways
someone can die?

125
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.275
Just open the door.

126
00:10:41.308 --> 00:10:43.144
I'll tell you.

127
00:10:43.177 --> 00:10:44.378
Come here.

128
00:10:48.883 --> 00:10:50.918
It's 'cause I have bodies
in there.

129
00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:56.924
I got living ones...dead ones.

130
00:10:57.358 --> 00:11:01.262
I open them up...
see what's inside.

131
00:11:01.295 --> 00:11:03.130
Then I put them
back together again

132
00:11:03.164 --> 00:11:05.666
to try and bring them back
to life.

133
00:11:11.105 --> 00:11:13.440
You're the body snatcher.

134
00:11:14.775 --> 00:11:16.177
"To examine the causes of life.

135
00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:18.379
we must first have recourse
to death."

136
00:11:18.412 --> 00:11:19.914
Aah!

137
00:11:19.947 --> 00:11:21.382
Jerome. I'm just messing
with you.

138
00:11:21.415 --> 00:11:22.716
Come on.

139
00:11:24.485 --> 00:11:25.986
Hey. Wait.
Let me see that.

140
00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.321
Get off me.

141
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:30.257
Come here.
Look at me.

142
00:11:31.392 --> 00:11:34.161
The mind and body. they're
beautiful things. Jerome.

143
00:11:35.262 --> 00:11:37.097
Don't waste or destroy them.

144
00:11:37.532 --> 00:11:40.734
Who's stopping someone
from destroying minds?

145
00:11:42.169 --> 00:11:43.804
Exactly.

146
00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:58.252
Now. the problem
with the cancer cells

147
00:11:58.285 --> 00:12:01.222
is once it begins
to metastasize.

148
00:12:01.255 --> 00:12:02.890
it's almost incurable because --

149
00:12:02.923 --> 00:12:04.725
There are over 100
different types.

150
00:12:05.826 --> 00:12:08.963
That is right. Vicaria.
However. if you --

151
00:12:08.996 --> 00:12:10.431
Kill cancer stem cells.

152
00:12:10.464 --> 00:12:13.234
we can prevent other cancers
from coming back.

153
00:12:13.267 --> 00:12:15.069
Thank you.
But --

154
00:12:15.102 --> 00:12:17.438
But that won't really work
since it adapts under pressure

155
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:19.240
and learns how to survive
under stress.

156
00:12:19.273 --> 00:12:21.942
-Do you have a question?
-No.

157
00:12:21.976 --> 00:12:24.245
Okay.
Moving forward with the lesson.

158
00:12:24.278 --> 00:12:26.313
I mean. but I do have a theory.

159
00:12:26.347 --> 00:12:27.515
What is it?

160
00:12:27.549 --> 00:12:29.984
Cancer is not a disease.

161
00:12:30.017 --> 00:12:31.418
It's a symptom.

162
00:12:31.452 --> 00:12:32.753
Symptom of what?

163
00:12:33.854 --> 00:12:35.155
Death.

164
00:12:36.357 --> 00:12:37.491
That's a little morbid for
the morning. don't you think?

165
00:12:37.525 --> 00:12:40.461
I mean. it really isn't
any more morbid than leukemia.

166
00:12:40.494 --> 00:12:42.062
Death isn't a disease.

167
00:12:42.096 --> 00:12:43.497
-Care to explain why?
-Because it's not.

168
00:12:43.531 --> 00:12:47.134
The human body is just
as dynamic as any cancer.

169
00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:48.936
I mean. if it never broke down.
it never died...

170
00:12:48.969 --> 00:12:50.538
- Stop interrupting.
- ...it wouldn't need help

171
00:12:50.572 --> 00:12:52.172
fighting off the cancer cell.

172
00:12:52.206 --> 00:12:53.974
I mean. listen to me
for like a second. okay?

173
00:12:54.008 --> 00:12:56.277
That's why death is the disease.

174
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:57.945
Are you kidding me right now?

175
00:13:00.948 --> 00:13:02.449
I need security at Room 10H.
please.

176
00:13:02.483 --> 00:13:04.285
-Okay. Come on.
-Thank you.

177
00:13:04.318 --> 00:13:05.419
I gave you a warning.

178
00:13:05.452 --> 00:13:07.087
Yeah.
That wasn't a warning.

179
00:13:07.121 --> 00:13:08.122
I'll tell you what.

180
00:13:08.155 --> 00:13:09.890
You can go to detention yourself

181
00:13:09.923 --> 00:13:11.526
or you can wait to be escorted
by an officer.

182
00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:13.160
It is your choice. Vicaria.

183
00:13:13.193 --> 00:13:16.163
It is Va-car-ia.
not Vie-care-ia.

184
00:13:16.598 --> 00:13:19.867
I'll call you Vicki.
because it's much easier.

185
00:13:21.235 --> 00:13:23.304
If you look right down
to the nucleolus.

186
00:13:23.337 --> 00:13:25.072
you will see the same exact...

187
00:13:27.575 --> 00:13:29.476
Well. if you get to call me
whatever you want.

188
00:13:29.511 --> 00:13:31.912
I guess I'm just gonna call you
Ms. Bitch from now on.

189
00:13:33.581 --> 00:13:35.983
Get out of my classroom
right now.

190
00:13:36.016 --> 00:13:37.184
Stand up.

191
00:13:44.124 --> 00:13:46.528
Get her out of my classroom.

192
00:13:47.261 --> 00:13:48.462
Let's go.

193
00:13:49.496 --> 00:13:50.998
I said let's go.

194
00:13:51.031 --> 00:13:52.433
- Let go of me.
- Get up.

195
00:13:52.466 --> 00:13:54.234
-Let go.
-Stop.

196
00:13:54.268 --> 00:13:55.503
-Get up! Come on!
-Get off of me.

197
00:14:28.969 --> 00:14:30.337
Thank you.

198
00:14:33.608 --> 00:14:36.276
Thank you for coming in today.

199
00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:38.979
I'm sorry if it was
any inconvenience.

200
00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:42.416
You know. I was thinking.

201
00:14:42.449 --> 00:14:44.985
Your last name.
it's so beautiful.

202
00:14:45.018 --> 00:14:46.286
It sounds European.

203
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.322
Where are you from?

204
00:14:49.557 --> 00:14:50.991
Yeah.

205
00:14:52.459 --> 00:14:56.430
Your daughter has
a very disturbing obsession.

206
00:14:56.463 --> 00:14:58.098
What obsession?

207
00:14:58.633 --> 00:15:00.702
Death.

208
00:15:00.735 --> 00:15:02.102
Death.

209
00:15:02.136 --> 00:15:04.338
It's all she talks about
in my classroom.

210
00:15:04.371 --> 00:15:07.040
She's been obsessed with it.
She thinks she can cure it.

211
00:15:07.074 --> 00:15:09.176
No.
I know I can cure it.

212
00:15:10.612 --> 00:15:12.714
I am not afraid of my ideas.

213
00:15:12.747 --> 00:15:15.215
I just think
time would be better spent

214
00:15:15.249 --> 00:15:17.619
on something
that she could actually do.

215
00:15:17.652 --> 00:15:21.188
Maybe an alternative school
would be a better fit for her.

216
00:15:21.221 --> 00:15:23.591
My daughter doesn't need
no continuation school.

217
00:15:23.625 --> 00:15:25.660
She's missing tests
and assignments.

218
00:15:25.693 --> 00:15:27.729
and there is only so much
extra credit I can --

219
00:15:29.263 --> 00:15:33.267
She takes the tests.
the assignments.

220
00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:35.335
extra credit. whatever.

221
00:15:35.369 --> 00:15:37.438
She got that.

222
00:15:37.471 --> 00:15:40.140
And I will continue
to encourage my daughter

223
00:15:40.174 --> 00:15:42.242
to think outside the box.

224
00:15:44.178 --> 00:15:47.448
Who do we talk to
about her college?

225
00:15:47.481 --> 00:15:50.618
I believe Mrs. Padilla
in the career center

226
00:15:50.652 --> 00:15:51.985
can help her make a plan.

227
00:15:52.019 --> 00:15:54.021
Ms. <i>Padilla.</i>

228
00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:57.991
What I need from you

229
00:15:58.025 --> 00:16:01.529
is to not call the goddamn cops
on my daughter

230
00:16:01.563 --> 00:16:04.566
whenever you have
a little petty disagreement.

231
00:16:04.599 --> 00:16:06.534
<i>That's</i> the child.

232
00:16:06.568 --> 00:16:07.602
Not you.

233
00:16:09.637 --> 00:16:12.206
Teach. lady.

234
00:16:12.574 --> 00:16:14.341
Teach.

235
00:16:18.513 --> 00:16:19.647
Come on. baby.

236
00:16:24.619 --> 00:16:25.753
Oh.

237
00:16:26.386 --> 00:16:28.723
And since you're so curious.

238
00:16:28.756 --> 00:16:33.060
our last name is German
because some overseer

239
00:16:33.093 --> 00:16:37.732
probably branded one of
my ancestors with his last name.

240
00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:42.402
Don't ever let them touch
my daughter again.

241
00:17:35.557 --> 00:17:37.357
Come on.

242
00:18:12.627 --> 00:18:14.829
Come on.

243
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:26.574
Okay. Chris.

244
00:18:27.775 --> 00:18:29.611
I got you.

245
00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:40.555
Come on.

246
00:18:46.594 --> 00:18:50.364
It's been a while.
but you're gonna be okay.

247
00:18:50.732 --> 00:18:52.900
I got you. Chris.

248
00:18:52.934 --> 00:18:54.602
I got you.

249
00:19:04.311 --> 00:19:07.447
You'll be back soon.
Mm-hmm.

250
00:19:24.866 --> 00:19:28.402
So. wait. Did he find out
about you missing classes?

251
00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:30.538
Does your mom know
that you're helping me out?

252
00:19:30.571 --> 00:19:31.806
No.

253
00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:34.474
You already know.

254
00:19:35.342 --> 00:19:36.878
I mean. he's using again. so...

255
00:19:36.911 --> 00:19:39.514
I told you.
Don't even worry about it. girl.

256
00:19:39.547 --> 00:19:40.882
He's thinking about
your brother.

257
00:19:40.915 --> 00:19:42.583
He didn't even have the chance
to bury him.

258
00:19:42.617 --> 00:19:44.284
Like. he shouldn't have to.

259
00:19:44.317 --> 00:19:46.219
-We shouldn't have to.
-I know.

260
00:19:46.253 --> 00:19:49.657
I just wish I could catch that
sick fuck who took his body.

261
00:19:49.691 --> 00:19:51.693
You and I both know
Chris wasn't the only body

262
00:19:51.726 --> 00:19:52.994
that went missing. V.

263
00:19:53.027 --> 00:19:54.261
Ooh!

264
00:19:54.294 --> 00:19:55.630
Hey.

265
00:19:55.663 --> 00:19:58.265
That's a Little Chris move
for his Auntie V.

266
00:19:58.298 --> 00:20:00.400
You feel him? Boy.

267
00:20:00.434 --> 00:20:02.335
Do we know his name yet?

268
00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:03.538
Stop asking me.

269
00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:05.640
-You know I'm not telling.
-Why?

270
00:20:05.673 --> 00:20:07.842
I promised Chris I wouldn't
say it until the baby's born.

271
00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:09.242
You know my loyalty to him.

272
00:20:09.276 --> 00:20:11.512
-I don't care about your racket.
-Bitch.

273
00:20:11.546 --> 00:20:15.482
Freeman!
Don't call your sister no bitch.

274
00:20:15.516 --> 00:20:17.451
When you call her a bitch.
you call all of us one.

275
00:20:17.484 --> 00:20:19.620
That's me. Mama. and Grandma.
Is that what you want?

276
00:20:19.654 --> 00:20:21.789
-No.
-Get out of here.

277
00:20:26.027 --> 00:20:27.394
Come here.

278
00:20:29.396 --> 00:20:31.364
Go study the alphabet.

279
00:20:33.034 --> 00:20:35.235
Without an attitude.

280
00:20:37.038 --> 00:20:38.740
A.

281
00:20:38.773 --> 00:20:40.541
B.

282
00:20:40.575 --> 00:20:42.476
C.

283
00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.377
D.

284
00:20:44.411 --> 00:20:46.514
E. F.

285
00:20:46.547 --> 00:20:48.281
-She about to get popped.
-G.

286
00:20:48.315 --> 00:20:49.884
-She know it.
-H.

287
00:20:49.917 --> 00:20:51.552
Stop playing with me.
little girl.

288
00:20:51.586 --> 00:20:53.788
-I. J.
-Girl. you're ready.

289
00:20:55.757 --> 00:20:56.858
L.

290
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.904
- Five-0. Five-0.
- Get down!

291
00:21:09.937 --> 00:21:12.372
Hey. Kango. let's roll.

292
00:21:12.405 --> 00:21:13.875
- Shit.
- Get off me!

293
00:21:13.908 --> 00:21:15.977
- Fuck y'all niggas.
- Get the fuck off me!

294
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.645
Hey. step back.

295
00:21:17.678 --> 00:21:19.346
-Shit! You shot him!
-Back the fuck off me. man!

296
00:21:19.379 --> 00:21:21.716
-Get the fuck off of me!
-Fucking pig!

297
00:21:21.749 --> 00:21:23.383
You shot my little nigga!
What the fuck. man?

298
00:21:23.416 --> 00:21:24.786
Dad.

299
00:21:27.054 --> 00:21:28.388
What happen. V?

300
00:21:28.421 --> 00:21:30.091
The fuck you do?

301
00:21:30.124 --> 00:21:32.693
- Requesting backup.
- You shot a kid. man!

302
00:21:32.727 --> 00:21:34.427
You shot a goddamn kid!

303
00:21:34.461 --> 00:21:37.397
What the fuck he could've
possibly did to you?

304
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:38.766
The rest of you. get back!

305
00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:40.568
Hey. yo. J. back up.
Back up.

306
00:21:40.601 --> 00:21:43.004
You pussy-ass niggas don't know
where the fuck they at.

307
00:21:46.007 --> 00:21:47.775
Seal off the edge
of the parking lot.

308
00:21:48.943 --> 00:21:50.377
Come on.
Let's get the boys. man.

309
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:51.712
They shot Jerome.

310
00:21:55.716 --> 00:21:57.618
117 is gonna move out.

311
00:21:57.652 --> 00:21:59.854
Go ahead and make a hole
for him.

312
00:21:59.887 --> 00:22:03.591
Everybody back.
Everybody over here. move back.

313
00:22:14.001 --> 00:22:16.469
Give us space and let us work.

314
00:22:16.504 --> 00:22:18.438
Hey.

315
00:22:18.471 --> 00:22:21.142
Get back.
You hear me?

316
00:22:21.175 --> 00:22:23.511
Give them space.

317
00:22:29.650 --> 00:22:31.152
Clear.

318
00:22:31.185 --> 00:22:33.521
All right. You heard him.
Everybody stand back.

319
00:22:33.554 --> 00:22:36.023
Charge.

320
00:22:37.758 --> 00:22:39.459
Clear.

321
00:22:39.492 --> 00:22:41.696
Stay with me. little man.

322
00:22:46.634 --> 00:22:49.103
Charge.

323
00:22:49.136 --> 00:22:50.538
Clear.

324
00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:31.258
Come on.

325
00:28:17.898 --> 00:28:19.400
Chris?

326
00:28:23.538 --> 00:28:26.040
Holy shit!
I did it!

327
00:28:27.975 --> 00:28:30.044
Oh. my God.

328
00:28:30.411 --> 00:28:32.313
Holy shit.

329
00:28:34.448 --> 00:28:36.116
Chris?

330
00:28:37.519 --> 00:28:39.320
It's Vicaria.

331
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:50.431
I'm not gonna hurt you.

332
00:28:50.464 --> 00:28:53.500
I'm not gonna hurt you.
It's okay.

333
00:28:59.974 --> 00:29:01.308
It's okay.

334
00:29:08.882 --> 00:29:10.751
It's okay.

335
00:29:13.387 --> 00:29:16.790
I'm gonna show you
who killed you.

336
00:29:18.926 --> 00:29:21.996
And I'm gonna show you
what's killing our dad. okay?

337
00:29:42.449 --> 00:29:44.485
Yo. what the fuck are you doing?

338
00:29:44.519 --> 00:29:47.021
Whoa.
Vicaria?

339
00:29:47.054 --> 00:29:48.822
-Who the fuck is you --
-Yo. Curtis. No.

340
00:29:48.856 --> 00:29:50.824
You stay.

341
00:29:52.459 --> 00:29:53.894
Move. nigga.

342
00:29:55.863 --> 00:29:57.264
I said move.

343
00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:01.969
No! Chris. stop!

344
00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:25.092
Hey. yo. Curt.

345
00:30:25.125 --> 00:30:27.194
Shit. Curt!
Hey.

346
00:30:27.227 --> 00:30:30.230
- Help me! Please!
- Hey. yo! Go get them. man!

347
00:30:31.633 --> 00:30:33.133
Shit.

348
00:30:46.146 --> 00:30:47.615
Shit.

349
00:30:51.318 --> 00:30:53.921
Right here. Right here.

350
00:30:54.355 --> 00:30:56.156
Go down there and check.

351
00:30:58.992 --> 00:31:00.160
Fuck!

352
00:31:00.528 --> 00:31:02.129
All right. man.
Let's circle back.

353
00:31:02.162 --> 00:31:03.897
We need to check on Curt.

354
00:31:03.931 --> 00:31:05.499
Come on. man.
Let's roll!

355
00:32:16.103 --> 00:32:17.371
-Yo.
-Walk. little nigga.

356
00:32:20.407 --> 00:32:21.475
Man. walk.

357
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:23.310
Get off of me.

358
00:32:32.720 --> 00:32:35.255
Who was with you?

359
00:32:35.289 --> 00:32:37.559
Where the fuck my shit at?

360
00:32:39.493 --> 00:32:42.262
Jamaal said he seen you
running away.

361
00:32:43.497 --> 00:32:46.066
What. you hardheaded
like your brother?

362
00:32:46.099 --> 00:32:48.001
Fuck you. Kango.

363
00:32:48.435 --> 00:32:50.070
- Hey. yo. Chill!
- No. man.

364
00:32:50.103 --> 00:32:51.405
We don't know
if Curt gonna make it.

365
00:32:51.438 --> 00:32:53.207
Relax. nigga!

366
00:32:58.345 --> 00:32:59.547
Look here. nigga.

367
00:32:59.581 --> 00:33:01.683
Let's just set
the record straight.

368
00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:04.184
I ain't kill your brother.

369
00:33:04.619 --> 00:33:07.020
-You sent him down there.
-He his own man. ain't he?

370
00:33:07.054 --> 00:33:08.455
Is that really how you feel?

371
00:33:10.257 --> 00:33:12.459
You still ain't answered
my question.

372
00:33:14.161 --> 00:33:15.462
Who was with you?

373
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:20.568
That's all right.
You ain't got to say shit.

374
00:33:21.201 --> 00:33:23.470
My niggas gonna raise him.

375
00:33:23.505 --> 00:33:25.807
But see. now. me and you.
we got a problem.

376
00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.610
'Cause you know
you done fucked up. right?

377
00:33:32.547 --> 00:33:34.248
Now. your ass lucky
Curt ain't dead.

378
00:33:34.281 --> 00:33:36.149
Otherwise. this shit
could've went real sideways.

379
00:33:36.183 --> 00:33:37.451
But you already know that.
don't you?

380
00:33:38.218 --> 00:33:39.754
Now. why Jada
be running around here

381
00:33:39.787 --> 00:33:42.222
calling you some type
of mad scientist or shit?

382
00:33:42.256 --> 00:33:44.659
- Ain't that right?
- Yeah. That's that shit.

383
00:33:44.692 --> 00:33:47.394
I mean. I got a lab for you.

384
00:33:47.427 --> 00:33:49.296
Whole little chemistry set. too.

385
00:33:49.329 --> 00:33:52.734
You can get busy in there. do
your little tables and whatnot.

386
00:33:55.603 --> 00:33:58.171
And I mean.
since you ain't saying shit.

387
00:33:58.205 --> 00:33:59.674
I guess you're cutting
for me now.

388
00:34:02.744 --> 00:34:04.044
Hey. yo!

389
00:34:13.521 --> 00:34:15.757
Death come quick around here.

390
00:34:43.585 --> 00:34:45.419
Hey. Little nigga.

391
00:34:45.452 --> 00:34:47.722
-Come roll with me real quick.
-Okay. Wait. Where we going?

392
00:34:47.755 --> 00:34:49.624
Time to work. What you mean?
Come on.

393
00:34:49.657 --> 00:34:51.659
Okay. Can I change
clothes first? Damn.

394
00:34:56.698 --> 00:34:58.365
Get off of me.

395
00:35:08.643 --> 00:35:10.143
Sit.

396
00:35:21.321 --> 00:35:22.890
I'm not helping you cut poison.

397
00:35:22.924 --> 00:35:23.992
All right.

398
00:35:27.729 --> 00:35:29.764
Just tell us where your boy at
and you ain't got to.

399
00:35:29.797 --> 00:35:33.433
-I don't know where he is.
-Ah. So there <i>is</i> somebody.

400
00:35:39.272 --> 00:35:41.876
God.

401
00:35:44.812 --> 00:35:47.447
No. I'm --

402
00:35:49.984 --> 00:35:51.786
You like rice?

403
00:35:53.353 --> 00:35:55.690
Me personally. I love rice.

404
00:35:56.758 --> 00:35:58.760
It's cheap. plentiful.

405
00:35:58.793 --> 00:36:00.595
It's kind of like synthetics.

406
00:36:00.628 --> 00:36:03.196
Cheap and can feed
a whole family.

407
00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:04.799
Now. too much of that shit.
and. I mean...

408
00:36:07.935 --> 00:36:09.837
...it all fall apart.

409
00:36:19.279 --> 00:36:21.281
You want to know how much
is too much?

410
00:36:22.382 --> 00:36:25.853
Just the size of a small grain
of rice.

411
00:36:26.486 --> 00:36:27.922
See. I'm gonna need you
to remember that

412
00:36:27.955 --> 00:36:29.724
when you're cutting my shit.
yeah?

413
00:36:32.459 --> 00:36:34.829
My niggas <i>will</i> find your boy.

414
00:36:35.462 --> 00:36:37.632
What are you gonna do
if you find him?

415
00:36:48.375 --> 00:36:49.677
Shh.

416
00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:06.994
How about you just focus on
cutting. measuring. and bagging?

417
00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:12.432
Keep that little bougie-ass
attitude to yourself. yeah?

418
00:37:15.837 --> 00:37:17.471
Pick it up.

419
00:37:22.409 --> 00:37:23.711
Pick it up.

420
00:37:38.593 --> 00:37:40.293
See?

421
00:37:44.999 --> 00:37:46.299
Hey!

422
00:37:46.333 --> 00:37:48.636
Don't be slamming
my fucking door!

423
00:37:49.537 --> 00:37:51.773
Hawaiian-shirt-ass nigga.

424
00:39:19.894 --> 00:39:21.529
Shit.

425
00:39:21.562 --> 00:39:23.396
Stop there
and get your ass on the ground!

426
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:24.599
Now!

427
00:40:02.703 --> 00:40:05.438
Freeman. Ma doesn't
want me teaching this to you

428
00:40:05.472 --> 00:40:07.008
because she thinks
you're too young.

429
00:40:07.041 --> 00:40:08.441
But they killed Emmett Till

430
00:40:08.475 --> 00:40:11.078
when he was just two years older
than you.

431
00:40:11.746 --> 00:40:13.581
And you know
what them folks say.

432
00:40:14.582 --> 00:40:17.752
You want to hide something from
a nigga. you put it in a book.

433
00:40:18.185 --> 00:40:20.521
But this.

434
00:40:20.554 --> 00:40:21.789
Do you see this?

435
00:40:22.757 --> 00:40:25.026
The truth.

436
00:40:25.059 --> 00:40:27.028
This is your real history.

437
00:40:27.061 --> 00:40:30.598
They out here fighting to keep
true history out of schools

438
00:40:30.631 --> 00:40:32.867
so they can keep teaching you
the fake shit.

439
00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:37.004
But Columbus wasn't nothing
but a human-trafficking rapist.

440
00:40:38.839 --> 00:40:40.074
Now go on.

441
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:44.477
You ready to move on to reading?

442
00:40:44.512 --> 00:40:47.048
Can I practice my alphabet
a little more?

443
00:40:47.081 --> 00:40:49.183
Okay.
But this is the last day.

444
00:40:49.216 --> 00:40:51.652
Yay.
More learning.

445
00:40:55.957 --> 00:40:58.125
Can I hang out
with my friend after?

446
00:40:58.159 --> 00:40:59.794
What friend?

447
00:40:59.827 --> 00:41:00.795
Chris.

448
00:41:02.163 --> 00:41:04.198
Yeah. but only after you finish.

449
00:41:04.832 --> 00:41:08.002
Okay. A.

450
00:41:12.239 --> 00:41:13.808
Who's her friend?

451
00:41:13.841 --> 00:41:15.710
Girl. I don't know.

452
00:41:16.277 --> 00:41:17.979
Probably a new tenant.

453
00:41:18.012 --> 00:41:19.513
So. what's up?

454
00:41:19.547 --> 00:41:20.781
You helping me out?

455
00:41:20.815 --> 00:41:22.116
C.

456
00:41:22.149 --> 00:41:24.185
Hello?
You helping me out or what?

457
00:41:24.218 --> 00:41:25.586
Come on. You can do it.

458
00:41:25.619 --> 00:41:27.088
Uh. yeah.

459
00:41:27.722 --> 00:41:30.858
Yeah. Uh. look. You keep missing
this part about ions.

460
00:41:30.891 --> 00:41:33.194
Nigga. what's up with you?

461
00:41:33.227 --> 00:41:35.162
I seen you on the block
hanging out with Kango.

462
00:41:35.196 --> 00:41:38.566
-You know it. Come on. C.
-You're not mixed up in that?

463
00:41:38.599 --> 00:41:40.868
-No. I'm not. I'm not.
-Chris wouldn't want that.

464
00:41:40.901 --> 00:41:42.536
-You better not be.
-Aisha. I'm not.

465
00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:45.606
All right.
I just don't want you caught up.

466
00:41:45.639 --> 00:41:47.875
-I told my mom about your dad.
-What?

467
00:41:47.908 --> 00:41:49.677
She wants to have y'all over
for dinner.

468
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:51.312
And maybe it's good for him
to get around family.

469
00:41:51.345 --> 00:41:54.982
Look. I want my kid's
grandfather in his life.

470
00:41:55.016 --> 00:41:57.918
So what. you coming or not?

471
00:41:57.952 --> 00:41:59.954
Yeah. Fine.
I'll come.

472
00:42:01.088 --> 00:42:02.757
I'll see about him.

473
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:07.028
While you see about him.
a girl got to pee -- for two.

474
00:42:07.728 --> 00:42:10.231
This little nigga tap-dancing
on my bladder.

475
00:42:11.832 --> 00:42:13.768
Fucking nasty.

476
00:42:14.135 --> 00:42:16.103
Come on. You can do it.

477
00:42:16.137 --> 00:42:17.972
L.

478
00:42:24.178 --> 00:42:25.980
M.

479
00:42:27.114 --> 00:42:29.150
N.

480
00:42:29.183 --> 00:42:31.052
O.

481
00:42:31.685 --> 00:42:33.687
P.

482
00:42:33.721 --> 00:42:35.790
Q.

483
00:42:35.823 --> 00:42:37.825
R.

484
00:42:37.858 --> 00:42:40.094
S.

485
00:42:41.128 --> 00:42:43.164
T.

486
00:42:44.298 --> 00:42:46.734
U.

487
00:42:47.968 --> 00:42:49.770
-V.
-Who is that?

488
00:42:49.804 --> 00:42:52.273
You scared him.

489
00:42:56.410 --> 00:42:58.045
Jada. scared who?

490
00:42:59.747 --> 00:43:01.248
You know who.

491
00:43:02.716 --> 00:43:04.718
Jada. who was that?

492
00:43:06.754 --> 00:43:08.155
Jada.

493
00:43:08.789 --> 00:43:10.724
Chris.

494
00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.962
You saw my brother?

495
00:43:20.234 --> 00:43:21.936
Did you tell anyone?

496
00:43:24.705 --> 00:43:27.007
Where did you see him. Jada?

497
00:44:29.069 --> 00:44:30.838
- Hey.
- Let go of me!

498
00:44:30.871 --> 00:44:33.240
Kango been looking for you.
Let's go.

499
00:44:33.274 --> 00:44:34.742
Come on.

500
00:44:34.775 --> 00:44:36.477
You ain't been showing up
to put in work.

501
00:44:36.511 --> 00:44:37.912
and I'm tired
of looking for you.

502
00:44:37.945 --> 00:44:40.347
Who the fuck you think you is?

503
00:44:40.381 --> 00:44:43.150
You know.
Curtis still in the hospital.

504
00:44:43.184 --> 00:44:45.352
All he do is scream
about what he saw.

505
00:44:45.386 --> 00:44:48.756
You know. I didn't believe him
until I seen your nigga.

506
00:44:48.789 --> 00:44:51.492
Yeah.
I seen him.

507
00:44:51.526 --> 00:44:54.061
And I would have got him
if the cops wasn't there.

508
00:44:54.094 --> 00:44:56.163
But he got away.

509
00:44:56.197 --> 00:44:59.300
Kango don't believe it.
but I'm gonna prove it to him.

510
00:45:02.504 --> 00:45:05.172
You better pray
that Curtis don't die.

511
00:45:05.206 --> 00:45:07.074
Or I'm gonna dead you
like I did that cop.

512
00:45:08.943 --> 00:45:10.878
You know you're fucking with
my family structure. right?

513
00:45:10.911 --> 00:45:12.780
Don't give me that shit.
You've been messing with mine.

514
00:45:12.813 --> 00:45:14.516
Kicking that shit to my daddy.

515
00:45:14.549 --> 00:45:18.018
Addiction is an emotional issue.
not a substance one.

516
00:45:18.052 --> 00:45:19.420
Think about it.

517
00:45:19.453 --> 00:45:21.288
If there were more
mental clinics around here

518
00:45:21.322 --> 00:45:24.024
instead of police precincts. I'd
probably be in a different job.

519
00:45:24.458 --> 00:45:25.993
Whole different hustle.

520
00:45:27.494 --> 00:45:28.996
Like what?

521
00:45:29.029 --> 00:45:31.031
I mean. Kango. really.
What would you --

522
00:45:31.065 --> 00:45:33.167
What would you really be doing?
Huh?

523
00:45:33.901 --> 00:45:35.102
What. Kango?
Huh?

524
00:45:35.135 --> 00:45:37.471
What hustle? Huh?
King of the throne.

525
00:45:37.505 --> 00:45:39.240
-Fellas.
-What would you be doing?

526
00:45:39.273 --> 00:45:42.843
Y'all niggas remember
when her daddy came to me?

527
00:45:42.876 --> 00:45:45.813
I mean. he was
practically begging for it.

528
00:45:45.846 --> 00:45:47.014
Pleading.

529
00:45:47.549 --> 00:45:49.416
Hell. I almost forgot
he had a daughter

530
00:45:49.450 --> 00:45:52.152
the way he kept talking about
his baby boy.

531
00:45:52.186 --> 00:45:54.154
Looked like the nigga
was about to off himself.

532
00:45:54.188 --> 00:45:56.524
So yeah. I gave him that shit.

533
00:45:57.124 --> 00:45:58.826
That's not true.

534
00:45:58.859 --> 00:46:01.895
I'm the one that's keeping
your fucking family alive!

535
00:46:11.238 --> 00:46:13.107
You got something else to say?

536
00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:23.984
Get to work.

537
00:46:41.869 --> 00:46:43.470
See you tomorrow.

538
00:46:50.477 --> 00:46:51.445
Follow her.

539
00:48:27.709 --> 00:48:30.177
- Boo!
- Jesus.

540
00:48:33.447 --> 00:48:35.583
J. this isn't funny.

541
00:48:35.617 --> 00:48:37.317
I'm serious.

542
00:48:37.351 --> 00:48:39.486
Chris isn't in here.

543
00:48:39.521 --> 00:48:41.589
How do you know?

544
00:48:41.623 --> 00:48:45.359
Maybe he's waiting for you.

545
00:48:47.629 --> 00:48:49.129
Okay.
Where?

546
00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:52.299
Behind you.

547
00:50:29.463 --> 00:50:31.031
Okay.

548
00:50:41.743 --> 00:50:43.143
Vicaria.

549
00:50:44.378 --> 00:50:46.681
V?

550
00:50:46.714 --> 00:50:48.315
V?!

551
00:50:49.116 --> 00:50:50.518
V?!

552
00:50:52.654 --> 00:50:55.122
V!
What's wrong?

553
00:50:55.155 --> 00:50:57.424
I saw something.
It was over there.

554
00:50:57.457 --> 00:50:59.426
No. no.
No. Dad.

555
00:50:59.459 --> 00:51:02.396
There's no one there.

556
00:51:02.429 --> 00:51:04.464
I don't know who that was.

557
00:51:08.502 --> 00:51:11.806
Whoever it was.
you scared them off.

558
00:51:12.439 --> 00:51:13.675
They're gone.

559
00:51:14.842 --> 00:51:16.678
It's okay.

560
00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.414
I got to go see
if somebody out there.

561
00:51:20.447 --> 00:51:22.282
No.
No. no.

562
00:51:22.316 --> 00:51:23.585
I'm okay.

563
00:51:23.618 --> 00:51:26.253
I'm okay.
I swear.

564
00:51:26.286 --> 00:51:27.789
Okay.

565
00:51:27.822 --> 00:51:29.089
All right.

566
00:51:30.925 --> 00:51:33.226
Get some rest.
It's all right.

567
00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:34.696
Okay.

568
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.487
Mom. I'm hungry.

569
00:53:07.522 --> 00:53:09.489
Me too. baby. okay? Just wait.

570
00:53:09.524 --> 00:53:11.491
Have you seen
Malcolm X's book. Jada?

571
00:53:11.526 --> 00:53:13.260
Chris took it.

572
00:53:13.293 --> 00:53:15.262
Jada. enough with
the imaginary friend.

573
00:53:15.295 --> 00:53:17.765
He's not my imaginary friend.

574
00:53:17.799 --> 00:53:18.866
He talks to me.

575
00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:21.836
Jada. stop it.

576
00:53:23.571 --> 00:53:25.238
You know what?

577
00:53:25.272 --> 00:53:26.808
This close.

578
00:53:28.475 --> 00:53:30.778
Y'all come to the table.

579
00:53:30.812 --> 00:53:32.747
Hey.

580
00:53:36.483 --> 00:53:37.852
- Who is it?
- Donald.

581
00:53:37.885 --> 00:53:39.620
He talks to you?

582
00:53:41.522 --> 00:53:43.323
Okay.
Stay away from him.

583
00:53:43.356 --> 00:53:46.326
-Why?
-He's dangerous.

584
00:53:46.359 --> 00:53:47.628
No. he's not.

585
00:53:47.662 --> 00:53:50.397
Jada. just do it.

586
00:53:52.399 --> 00:53:54.434
I'm gonna see
a lot more of you around here

587
00:53:54.468 --> 00:53:55.803
when our grandchild arrives.

588
00:53:55.837 --> 00:53:57.538
Of course.

589
00:53:57.572 --> 00:54:00.340
Busting down the door
like you're the police.

590
00:54:02.977 --> 00:54:04.779
Sorry. sweetheart.

591
00:54:04.812 --> 00:54:06.413
Sit down so we can eat.

592
00:54:06.446 --> 00:54:08.281
Okay.

593
00:54:08.315 --> 00:54:09.550
Ooh.

594
00:54:09.584 --> 00:54:10.985
All right.

595
00:54:11.018 --> 00:54:12.887
You gonna say the grace?

596
00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.522
Come on.

597
00:54:16.456 --> 00:54:18.291
Lord. thank you for this food

598
00:54:18.325 --> 00:54:20.528
and bless the hands
that prepared it.

599
00:54:20.561 --> 00:54:21.996
- Amen.
- Amen.

600
00:54:23.865 --> 00:54:25.900
All right. y'all.
Dig in.

601
00:54:31.105 --> 00:54:32.507
This looks amazing.

602
00:54:35.042 --> 00:54:36.744
Aisha. you want some of this?

603
00:54:41.916 --> 00:54:44.484
Does anybody want some of this?

604
00:54:44.519 --> 00:54:45.820
So. how's school?

605
00:54:46.453 --> 00:54:49.724
Ms. K raised my grades
after you talked to her.

606
00:54:50.792 --> 00:54:52.794
And your other classes?

607
00:54:52.827 --> 00:54:53.861
It's good.

608
00:54:54.494 --> 00:54:56.396
Even with your truancies?

609
00:54:56.429 --> 00:54:58.331
Mm-hmm.

610
00:54:58.365 --> 00:55:01.334
You've been taking advantage of
your dad working double shifts.

611
00:55:01.368 --> 00:55:03.336
And we know you cover for her.

612
00:55:03.370 --> 00:55:06.541
Calling into the school.
acting like somebody's guardian.

613
00:55:06.574 --> 00:55:09.544
Well. um. I'll have a 3.9
before the end of the semester.

614
00:55:09.577 --> 00:55:11.913
Yeah. And she's helping me
raise my biology grade. so...

615
00:55:11.946 --> 00:55:13.781
Mm-hmm.

616
00:55:13.815 --> 00:55:15.482
-That's good.
-Yeah.

617
00:55:15.516 --> 00:55:16.984
Just don't lie to us.

618
00:55:17.018 --> 00:55:18.753
He's got another pair of eyes
now.

619
00:55:18.786 --> 00:55:20.721
-Yes. Dad.
-Yes. Mom.

620
00:55:20.755 --> 00:55:24.859
I even heard about Ms. Kempe
asking y'all where you're from.

621
00:55:25.526 --> 00:55:27.562
Negroes been here
just as long as them folks.

622
00:55:27.595 --> 00:55:29.396
and they still act confused
when they see us.

623
00:55:29.429 --> 00:55:31.966
Longer than them.
We just left after we visited.

624
00:55:31.999 --> 00:55:34.101
- Okay. You're hotepping.
- I ain't hotepping.

625
00:55:34.135 --> 00:55:37.370
We got to know who we are. V.
Miss PWI Princess.

626
00:55:37.404 --> 00:55:39.073
"I'm gonna bring Jesus back
from the grave. cure death."

627
00:55:39.106 --> 00:55:40.508
Shut up. Aisha.

628
00:55:40.541 --> 00:55:41.876
You want to cure death.
Then what?

629
00:55:41.909 --> 00:55:43.476
-What you mean?
-What happens after that?

630
00:55:43.511 --> 00:55:44.846
We get a second chance at life.

631
00:55:44.879 --> 00:55:46.581
What's the point
when them folks still active?

632
00:55:46.614 --> 00:55:47.849
We can't do nothing dead.

633
00:55:47.882 --> 00:55:49.050
The system traps us
if we're alive.

634
00:55:49.083 --> 00:55:50.685
-Fuck the system.
-Hey.

635
00:55:50.718 --> 00:55:52.086
That system that you don't give
a fuck about.

636
00:55:52.119 --> 00:55:53.521
Aisha!

637
00:55:55.122 --> 00:55:56.791
That system that you
don't care about.

638
00:55:56.824 --> 00:55:59.459
-Go on.
-Been robbing us of our culture.

639
00:55:59.492 --> 00:56:02.129
our name. our identity.
our history.

640
00:56:02.163 --> 00:56:04.565
They got us out here
killing each other. V.

641
00:56:04.599 --> 00:56:06.100
not knowing who we are.

642
00:56:06.133 --> 00:56:08.468
-You got your way. I got mine.
-Fine. Then say less.

643
00:56:08.501 --> 00:56:12.874
V. you can take in
more than one idea.

644
00:56:13.774 --> 00:56:15.475
Think about it.

645
00:56:16.777 --> 00:56:18.512
What if both of y'all are right?

646
00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:20.514
-No.
-No.

647
00:56:25.052 --> 00:56:26.854
You're doing good.

648
00:56:28.089 --> 00:56:29.857
You still got family here.

649
00:56:29.891 --> 00:56:31.993
I just want to see him again.

650
00:56:32.026 --> 00:56:33.861
I'm gonna get it right.

651
00:56:33.895 --> 00:56:37.198
Right. I know it's hard
with you working double shifts.

652
00:56:52.146 --> 00:56:53.981
You too. Miss Lady.

653
00:56:54.015 --> 00:56:55.482
V.

654
00:56:55.516 --> 00:56:57.484
Don't worry about that.
Jada did that.

655
00:57:00.087 --> 00:57:02.590
I know I'm not the same.

656
00:57:03.157 --> 00:57:06.694
It's so hard trying to be there
for you

657
00:57:06.727 --> 00:57:08.562
when I failed Chris.

658
00:57:08.596 --> 00:57:10.765
It's not your fault. Dad.

659
00:57:10.798 --> 00:57:14.769
I'm gonna get this right. baby.
I promise you.

660
00:57:15.770 --> 00:57:17.138
I ain't gonna let you down.

661
00:57:18.172 --> 00:57:20.041
You never have.

662
00:57:21.242 --> 00:57:25.179
He's been
watching you. body snatcher.

663
00:57:29.050 --> 00:57:31.519
He's here.

664
00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:40.995
-Who is it?
-No. Freeman.

665
00:57:41.028 --> 00:57:42.930
- This is the police.
- Oh. shit.

666
00:57:42.964 --> 00:57:44.865
Get away from the door.

667
00:57:46.267 --> 00:57:47.802
Yes?

668
00:57:47.835 --> 00:57:50.638
We're investigating
the murder of an officer!

669
00:57:52.673 --> 00:57:54.275
Can you open the door. please?!

670
00:57:54.308 --> 00:57:56.544
No. we cannot.

671
00:57:56.911 --> 00:57:59.680
Have you seen
any suspicious activity?

672
00:57:59.714 --> 00:58:01.682
No. we have not.

673
00:58:06.887 --> 00:58:08.522
What'd I tell you?

674
00:58:08.556 --> 00:58:10.257
Don't open the door
unless I know who it is.

675
00:58:10.291 --> 00:58:12.293
If them folks ask where
you're going. what do you say?

676
00:58:12.326 --> 00:58:14.862
That I'm going home.

677
00:58:14.895 --> 00:58:16.797
- What else?
- My name.

678
00:58:20.067 --> 00:58:22.770
Man.

679
00:58:22.803 --> 00:58:24.038
Hm.

680
00:58:25.873 --> 00:58:27.041
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

681
00:58:27.808 --> 00:58:28.976
You did good.

682
00:58:31.312 --> 00:58:32.747
Mm.

683
00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:35.182
Don't let them racketeers
ruin the meal.

684
00:58:38.019 --> 00:58:40.554
What did Chris use to call them?

685
00:58:40.588 --> 00:58:41.722
Racketeers. right?

686
00:58:44.225 --> 00:58:45.960
I know it's hard
to talk about him.

687
00:58:45.993 --> 00:58:48.662
but it's good to remember
the happy times.

688
00:58:49.897 --> 00:58:52.099
Death always got to be
so tragic.

689
00:58:56.070 --> 00:58:58.706
It's racket busters.

690
00:59:00.841 --> 00:59:02.043
Racket busters.

691
00:59:02.076 --> 00:59:04.779
No.
Dad. don't.

692
00:59:06.047 --> 00:59:07.348
Do not.

693
00:59:07.381 --> 00:59:10.351
- The racket busters!
- Don't.

694
00:59:10.384 --> 00:59:12.586
Stop. You sound corny.

695
00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:16.624
Hey. don't let the
racket busters ruin the meal!

696
00:59:16.657 --> 00:59:18.993
You sound corny.

697
00:59:19.026 --> 00:59:20.261
You got one for me?

698
00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:23.697
Racket busters.

699
00:59:23.731 --> 00:59:26.367
No. no.
This is for your brother.

700
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.369
This is for your brother
right here.

701
00:59:28.402 --> 00:59:31.105
-Put some on it. now.
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

702
00:59:31.138 --> 00:59:33.007
Racket busters!

703
00:59:36.043 --> 00:59:37.945
All right.

704
00:59:37.978 --> 00:59:39.046
You ready?

705
00:59:39.080 --> 00:59:40.648
The racket busters.

706
00:59:40.681 --> 00:59:42.817
Yay!
That's my baby girl.

707
00:59:44.051 --> 00:59:46.053
Hey.
Can you top that?

708
00:59:46.087 --> 00:59:47.688
Racket busters.

709
00:59:49.156 --> 00:59:51.792
-You have to get up in here.
-Racket busters!

710
00:59:53.694 --> 00:59:56.297
You sound like a white
woman. but you're all right.

711
00:59:56.330 --> 00:59:58.732
-Hit it for me.
-Racket busters.

712
01:00:00.668 --> 01:00:02.236
She put her neck in it.

713
01:00:02.269 --> 01:00:05.806
She put everything.
Put her foot up in that one.

714
01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.008
R-R-Racket!

715
01:00:08.042 --> 01:00:09.176
I love you. Dad.

716
01:00:09.210 --> 01:00:10.744
I love you too. baby.

717
01:00:12.146 --> 01:00:14.982
You know
you had to get in there.

718
01:00:31.332 --> 01:00:33.667
Hey. pal.
Where you headed?

719
01:00:33.701 --> 01:00:35.336
He fits the description.

720
01:00:35.369 --> 01:00:36.971
Home.

721
01:00:38.272 --> 01:00:44.378
See...my...father.

722
01:00:44.411 --> 01:00:46.213
You feeling
all right tonight. sir?

723
01:00:46.247 --> 01:00:49.116
Put your hands behind your back
for me. okay?

724
01:00:50.951 --> 01:00:53.721
I'm Chris.

725
01:00:53.754 --> 01:00:55.389
You're not Chris.

726
01:00:55.422 --> 01:00:58.826
You're the monster
who kills cops.

727
01:01:01.095 --> 01:01:03.797
Hey! Hey. sir! Sir!

728
01:01:03.831 --> 01:01:05.699
Stand down!

729
01:01:08.269 --> 01:01:09.870
Oh. shit.

730
01:01:13.474 --> 01:01:15.176
You got him.
You got him.

731
01:01:15.209 --> 01:01:17.411
Jesus Christ.
Did you see that?

732
01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:22.750
I think it's him.

733
01:01:39.433 --> 01:01:42.203
I got a --
I have a monster out here.

734
01:01:42.236 --> 01:01:43.404
Monster.

735
01:01:46.273 --> 01:01:48.309
Man. what the fuck do you want?

736
01:01:48.342 --> 01:01:50.811
-I need to see Kango.
-That nigga not here.

737
01:01:51.245 --> 01:01:54.381
-Little nigga. I swear to God.
-Fuck you. Jamaal.

738
01:02:14.802 --> 01:02:16.270
Vicaria?

739
01:02:19.006 --> 01:02:21.942
Hello?
V?

740
01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.335
Yo.
What's g--

741
01:02:50.572 --> 01:02:52.006
What?

742
01:02:53.474 --> 01:02:55.510
Hey!

743
01:03:11.058 --> 01:03:13.193
Uh-huh.

744
01:03:13.227 --> 01:03:14.495
All right.

745
01:03:21.569 --> 01:03:23.270
I found your drugs.

746
01:03:23.904 --> 01:03:26.073
Now. stay away from my family.

747
01:03:26.106 --> 01:03:27.875
I'm done.

748
01:03:27.908 --> 01:03:30.010
But what about your boy?

749
01:03:30.044 --> 01:03:31.278
Chris?

750
01:03:33.947 --> 01:03:36.183
Chris.

751
01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:45.159
Where you been?

752
01:03:48.996 --> 01:03:51.999
Everybody said you was...
was dead.

753
01:03:55.502 --> 01:03:57.404
Chris.

754
01:04:01.041 --> 01:04:02.409
Father.

755
01:04:03.678 --> 01:04:06.880
You ain't Chris.
No.

756
01:04:07.381 --> 01:04:09.249
You know what I heard
on the phone?

757
01:04:10.652 --> 01:04:12.587
Curtis is dead.

758
01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.357
While her nigga gave me this.

759
01:04:16.390 --> 01:04:18.092
Jamaal.

760
01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:20.060
You said it'd go the other way
if he didn't make it.

761
01:04:20.094 --> 01:04:21.495
-He ain't here no more.
-Jamaal.

762
01:04:21.529 --> 01:04:23.397
So why the fuck
is she still standing there?

763
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:24.898
Keep your voice down.

764
01:04:24.932 --> 01:04:27.067
Now. let her the fuck go.

765
01:04:28.168 --> 01:04:30.437
-You heard me.
-No.

766
01:04:30.471 --> 01:04:32.172
She don't get off that easy.

767
01:04:32.206 --> 01:04:33.907
You better remember
who the fuck you're talking to.

768
01:04:33.941 --> 01:04:35.476
-Her nigga almost killed me.
-Yeah. I know that.

769
01:04:35.510 --> 01:04:37.144
You won't believe me when
I tell you what it looked like.

770
01:04:37.177 --> 01:04:40.147
-I told you I believe you.
-And it's right here!

771
01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:43.884
You get out of here.

772
01:04:44.318 --> 01:04:45.953
You're just gonna side with her.

773
01:04:52.226 --> 01:04:54.061
Oh. shit!

774
01:04:59.099 --> 01:05:00.200
Fuck.

775
01:05:01.468 --> 01:05:04.338
No!

776
01:05:04.371 --> 01:05:06.473
V!

777
01:05:06.508 --> 01:05:08.543
No. No.

778
01:05:49.450 --> 01:05:50.718
Dad?

779
01:06:02.597 --> 01:06:04.064
Dad.

780
01:07:52.372 --> 01:07:54.241
I'm sorry.

781
01:07:54.274 --> 01:07:56.243
I'm sorry.

782
01:08:02.517 --> 01:08:05.319
No!

783
01:08:23.538 --> 01:08:25.472
Get away from me.

784
01:08:26.808 --> 01:08:29.309
Get away from me!

785
01:08:34.348 --> 01:08:35.683
Get away.

786
01:08:36.818 --> 01:08:38.185
I said get away!

787
01:09:06.781 --> 01:09:08.448
That's him.

788
01:09:10.551 --> 01:09:12.319
I told you.

789
01:10:05.439 --> 01:10:06.708
-That was him. wasn't it?
-Yeah.

790
01:10:06.741 --> 01:10:08.009
-Huh?
-Yes.

791
01:10:08.042 --> 01:10:09.911
Tell me what the fuck
that nigga's --

792
01:10:09.944 --> 01:10:11.746
-It's hard to explain.
-Nigga. get that --

793
01:10:11.779 --> 01:10:13.380
It's Chris.

794
01:10:13.413 --> 01:10:14.582
That shit wasn't Chris.
That shit looked dead.

795
01:10:14.615 --> 01:10:15.850
Who do you think moved the body?

796
01:10:15.883 --> 01:10:17.250
What the fuck
are you talking about?

797
01:10:17.284 --> 01:10:18.553
Look.
I wanted to cure death.

798
01:10:18.586 --> 01:10:19.854
I had to get as many bodies
as I could

799
01:10:19.887 --> 01:10:21.388
to make Chris look like
his old self.

800
01:10:21.421 --> 01:10:23.356
You used dead Black bodies
for that shit?

801
01:10:23.390 --> 01:10:24.992
You're the fucking
body snatcher!

802
01:10:25.026 --> 01:10:27.294
You can't fucking judge me.
Look at what you do.

803
01:10:27.327 --> 01:10:29.262
I know your ass always want to
blame me for some shit.

804
01:10:29.296 --> 01:10:30.665
but I'm not out wilding
for the fuck of it!

805
01:10:30.698 --> 01:10:32.800
I ain't make no fucking monster!

806
01:10:32.834 --> 01:10:35.368
I got to put a --
I got to put a stop to it.

807
01:10:35.402 --> 01:10:37.004
-Shit.
-No.

808
01:10:37.038 --> 01:10:38.840
-No. I need him alive.
-Are you crazy?

809
01:10:38.873 --> 01:10:40.273
I need him alive so I can see
what would happen with him.

810
01:10:40.307 --> 01:10:41.609
-How the fuck do I kill it?
-Him.

811
01:10:41.642 --> 01:10:42.844
-It.
-Him!

812
01:10:42.877 --> 01:10:44.045
That shit ain't Chris
and you know it!

813
01:10:44.078 --> 01:10:45.680
-Get it through your head.
-Okay.

814
01:10:45.713 --> 01:10:47.048
You sold my daddy that poison.

815
01:10:47.081 --> 01:10:49.050
-You killed Chris. You did that.
-Shut the fuck up!

816
01:10:49.083 --> 01:10:50.651
This wouldn't have happened
if you'd just left him alone.

817
01:10:50.685 --> 01:10:52.419
But he had to put his hands
on his family.

818
01:10:52.452 --> 01:10:54.021
I mean. the gun was never meant
to be a tool of death.

819
01:10:54.055 --> 01:10:56.524
They used to make beautiful
fireworks in China with it.

820
01:10:56.557 --> 01:10:57.925
-Shut the fuck up!
-When Einstein made his equation

821
01:10:57.959 --> 01:10:59.727
to unlock new sources
of energy...

822
01:10:59.761 --> 01:11:01.529
-Quit the science shit.
-...they took that. and they --

823
01:11:01.562 --> 01:11:03.564
-Can you just shut the fuck up?
-Let me fucking finish!

824
01:11:03.598 --> 01:11:06.033
They took that.
and they made death.

825
01:11:07.568 --> 01:11:10.004
All I wanted to do
was fucking cure it.

826
01:11:11.072 --> 01:11:13.574
I didn't mean for this
to happen.

827
01:11:15.810 --> 01:11:17.879
I didn't mean for this
to happen.

828
01:11:23.483 --> 01:11:24.619
Fuck.

829
01:11:24.652 --> 01:11:26.954
Fuck.
Fuck!

830
01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:30.390
Come on! Come on!

831
01:11:30.423 --> 01:11:32.093
Okay!
Okay!

832
01:11:39.466 --> 01:11:41.536
Fuck.

833
01:11:41.569 --> 01:11:42.670
Okay.
Okay.

834
01:11:52.113 --> 01:11:54.347
We need to kill this thing.

835
01:11:56.617 --> 01:11:57.819
Now.

836
01:11:57.852 --> 01:12:00.721
Okay. Okay.

837
01:12:00.755 --> 01:12:04.125
Okay. I'm thinking.
I'm thinking.

838
01:12:04.158 --> 01:12:06.694
-Before it kills somebody else.
-Okay.

839
01:12:10.164 --> 01:12:12.465
Okay.

840
01:12:16.537 --> 01:12:18.573
Okay.

841
01:12:20.675 --> 01:12:22.643
Okay.

842
01:12:22.677 --> 01:12:25.046
Okay.
I did -- I did build it.

843
01:12:25.079 --> 01:12:27.014
I-I built it. so...

844
01:12:27.048 --> 01:12:29.951
so if I -- if I hit it
with enough electricity.

845
01:12:29.984 --> 01:12:32.419
then -- then maybe its body
will go down.

846
01:12:32.452 --> 01:12:34.922
-Maybe what? Come on.
-Look. Look. It's a theory.

847
01:12:34.956 --> 01:12:38.458
There are no guarantees. okay?
I just -- I need my tools.

848
01:12:39.093 --> 01:12:42.063
Wait?
Where the fuck are the tools?

849
01:12:42.897 --> 01:12:44.866
-One is in my lab.
-Where's the lab?

850
01:12:44.899 --> 01:12:46.433
-It's. um...
-Come on.

851
01:12:46.466 --> 01:12:48.102
It's the other side
of the complex. okay?

852
01:12:48.135 --> 01:12:50.705
It's through the green alleyway.
It's next to an abandoned unit.

853
01:12:50.738 --> 01:12:52.573
Okay?

854
01:12:52.607 --> 01:12:54.407
And the other one?

855
01:12:54.441 --> 01:12:56.010
It's in my room.

856
01:12:59.479 --> 01:13:01.515
We got to go the fuck
back out there with that thing?

857
01:13:01.549 --> 01:13:03.618
Kango -- Kango. we need both.

858
01:13:06.787 --> 01:13:08.089
Fuck!

859
01:13:08.122 --> 01:13:09.790
Shit!

860
01:13:13.561 --> 01:13:14.929
Please.

861
01:13:16.030 --> 01:13:17.497
Please.

862
01:13:30.645 --> 01:13:31.612
-Come on!
-Okay.

863
01:13:31.646 --> 01:13:32.947
-Go!
-Okay. Okay.

864
01:13:37.818 --> 01:13:40.154
You really just cheat death.

865
01:13:40.721 --> 01:13:42.156
What?

866
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:46.160
I shouldn't have never sent
Chris to kill them niggas.

867
01:13:47.094 --> 01:13:48.562
Go prep your lab.

868
01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:51.966
-I got the rest.
-Okay. Remember.

869
01:13:51.999 --> 01:13:54.635
It's on my desk. It's metal.
It's wired with antennas.

870
01:13:54.669 --> 01:13:56.137
-Go!
-Okay.

871
01:15:11.045 --> 01:15:12.213
Shit.

872
01:15:12.246 --> 01:15:14.215
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

873
01:15:17.318 --> 01:15:18.819
Shit.

874
01:15:34.235 --> 01:15:35.970
Jada. how did you find
this place?

875
01:15:36.003 --> 01:15:37.238
Okay. No.
You need to go home.

876
01:15:37.271 --> 01:15:39.707
It's not safe for you
to be here. okay?

877
01:15:40.875 --> 01:15:42.676
Oh. my God.
What happened to you?

878
01:15:45.379 --> 01:15:47.214
Jada.

879
01:15:49.083 --> 01:15:50.584
Jada. what happened?

880
01:15:50.618 --> 01:15:52.586
-I saw Chris.
-Hmm?

881
01:15:52.620 --> 01:15:53.721
He's coming.

882
01:15:58.025 --> 01:15:59.693
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

883
01:16:03.397 --> 01:16:05.132
Chris showed me this place.

884
01:16:05.166 --> 01:16:07.668
Jada. go back inside. okay?

885
01:16:07.701 --> 01:16:09.637
I told Chris who his family was.

886
01:16:09.670 --> 01:16:11.038
Jada!

887
01:16:11.072 --> 01:16:14.909
And when you came over
for dinner. I showed him.

888
01:16:14.942 --> 01:16:16.944
Jada. I'm serious. okay?
Go back inside.

889
01:16:16.977 --> 01:16:19.180
I showed him to his father.

890
01:16:19.814 --> 01:16:22.917
Something happened
when he was out there.

891
01:16:22.950 --> 01:16:26.020
because he came back different.
Vicaria.

892
01:16:26.887 --> 01:16:28.189
What?

893
01:16:31.292 --> 01:16:33.794
Okay.
Jada. it's not safe.

894
01:16:33.828 --> 01:16:35.229
You can't stay here.

895
01:16:35.262 --> 01:16:37.064
I'm serious.

896
01:17:07.828 --> 01:17:11.098
Oh. my God.
Kango. No.

897
01:22:02.990 --> 01:22:07.428
I'm...a...

898
01:22:07.461 --> 01:22:10.197
monster.

899
01:22:10.998 --> 01:22:15.102
My name...

900
01:22:15.135 --> 01:22:16.704
monster.

901
01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.509
No.

902
01:22:23.611 --> 01:22:25.412
You're Chris.

903
01:22:28.215 --> 01:22:30.317
You're my daddy's son.

904
01:22:31.586 --> 01:22:34.154
My mother's child.

905
01:22:43.397 --> 01:22:46.033
Who taught him how to talk?

906
01:22:46.066 --> 01:22:47.968
I did.

907
01:22:48.770 --> 01:22:51.472
Why did he hurt everyone?

908
01:22:52.239 --> 01:22:54.308
They called him a monster.

909
01:22:54.341 --> 01:22:56.611
Them folks did.

910
01:22:57.177 --> 01:22:58.979
And he believed it.

911
01:22:59.413 --> 01:23:01.482
They made him one. Jada.

912
01:23:03.551 --> 01:23:07.622
Can you bring our family back
like you did to Chris?

913
01:23:13.460 --> 01:23:15.530
What do you mean.
bring them back?

914
01:23:15.563 --> 01:23:19.333
Our family.
Can you bring them back?

915
01:23:35.817 --> 01:23:40.087
When Chris came back.
no one believed it was Chris.

916
01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.356
Not even Aisha.

917
01:23:42.389 --> 01:23:44.424
They attacked him.

918
01:23:44.458 --> 01:23:46.694
You can bring them back.
I know you can.

919
01:23:46.728 --> 01:23:48.530
Jada. it won't work.

920
01:23:52.534 --> 01:23:56.403
I saw Chris walk again
after he died.

921
01:23:56.436 --> 01:23:58.540
Because of you.

922
01:23:58.573 --> 01:24:01.543
You saw
what happened with Chris.

923
01:24:02.442 --> 01:24:05.647
Them folks ruined my idea.
They...

924
01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:07.549
Not just your idea.

925
01:24:07.582 --> 01:24:10.785
Remember what your dad said?
What Aisha said?

926
01:24:10.818 --> 01:24:13.621
Jada...I can't.

927
01:24:14.187 --> 01:24:18.292
You mean...they're gone?

928
01:24:28.468 --> 01:24:30.504
I'm sorry.

929
01:24:46.821 --> 01:24:48.523
Jada?

930
01:24:57.765 --> 01:24:59.433
Jada.

931
01:25:02.937 --> 01:25:04.706
Jada. look at me.

932
01:25:06.874 --> 01:25:09.443
They were just here.

933
01:25:15.850 --> 01:25:17.885
What'd you say?

934
01:25:19.621 --> 01:25:22.122
They were just here.

935
01:25:35.803 --> 01:25:37.805
They're still fresh.

936
01:25:38.438 --> 01:25:39.641
What?

937
01:25:46.848 --> 01:25:49.182
Jada...

938
01:25:50.417 --> 01:25:52.687
...they're still fresh.

939
01:26:23.718 --> 01:26:25.419
No. No.
No. no.

940
01:26:29.957 --> 01:26:31.659
Can you hear me?

941
01:26:36.396 --> 01:26:37.732
Where am I?

942
01:26:42.804 --> 01:26:44.872
What's your name?

943
01:26:45.506 --> 01:26:48.609
Victor -- Is he okay?

944
01:26:48.643 --> 01:26:51.344
No.
I-I need to hear your real name.

945
01:26:51.378 --> 01:26:54.615
It's Aisha.
Shut up.

946
01:27:01.421 --> 01:27:03.490
He's alive!

947
01:27:04.892 --> 01:27:07.929
He's -- He's really alive.

948
01:27:10.531 --> 01:27:12.567
He's alive.

949
01:27:16.303 --> 01:27:17.572
Victor.

950
01:27:18.606 --> 01:27:20.608
Chris wanted to name him
after you.

951
01:27:21.943 --> 01:27:23.945
Aisha!

952
01:27:24.612 --> 01:27:25.780
It's okay. sweetie.

953
01:27:25.813 --> 01:27:27.648
I'm glad you're back.

954
01:27:27.682 --> 01:27:29.884
Where's the rest of our family?

955
01:27:45.967 --> 01:27:48.002
They'll be here soon.
