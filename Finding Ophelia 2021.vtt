3
00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.430
Take
this kiss upon the brow.

4
00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.521
And in parting from you now.

5
00:04:21.957 --> 00:04:25.395
thus much let me avow.
you are not wrong.

6
00:04:25.395 --> 00:04:28.180
who deem that my days
have been a dream.

7
00:04:40.062 --> 00:04:44.284
Yet if hope has flown away.
in a night. or in a day.

8
00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:48.505
in a vision. or in none. is
it therefore the less gone?

9
00:04:50.855 --> 00:04:55.860
All that we see or seem is
but a dream within a dream.

10
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:31.608
- Well. you're out late tonight.

11
00:06:37.222 --> 00:06:39.094
Don't worry. I got
somethin' for ya.

12
00:06:40.008 --> 00:06:41.879
So today at the bank.

13
00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:43.490
an old lady asked me if I
could check her balance.

14
00:06:58.461 --> 00:06:59.680
You know. I told my girlfriend

15
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.812
she draws her eyebrows too high.

16
00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.535
What do you call a
guy with a rubber toe?

17
00:07:30.972 --> 00:07:32.495
Roberto.

18
00:07:38.588 --> 00:07:39.894
There it is. There it is.

19
00:07:39.894 --> 00:07:41.112
I know funny.

20
00:12:44.198 --> 00:12:45.677
Hey Will. it's Mike.

21
00:12:45.677 --> 00:12:47.375
Just got off the
phone with the client.

22
00:12:47.375 --> 00:12:48.680
Couldn't have gone better.

23
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.681
We're through to the next round.

24
00:12:49.681 --> 00:12:50.378
Call me back. okay?

25
00:13:00.214 --> 00:13:02.085
Hey Will. it's Mike.

26
00:13:02.085 --> 00:13:04.087
The client loved your ideas
and wants to have your babies.

27
00:13:04.087 --> 00:13:05.262
Call me.

28
00:13:25.892 --> 00:13:28.155
Hey Will. it's Mike.
Are you coming in today?

29
00:13:28.155 --> 00:13:29.678
I just wanted to say.

30
00:13:29.678 --> 00:13:31.201
I really appreciate
the amazing work

31
00:13:31.201 --> 00:13:32.812
you've put into
this pitch so far.

32
00:13:32.812 --> 00:13:34.596
So um. call me when
you get this. Okay?

33
00:15:50.601 --> 00:15:52.516
Will.

34
00:15:52.516 --> 00:15:54.518
You better have a good excuse
for not being here right now.

35
00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.790
- Sorry I'm late.

36
00:16:11.144 --> 00:16:12.928
- What's gotten into
you lately. Will?

37
00:16:14.669 --> 00:16:15.583
- Bourbon. Rocks.

38
00:16:18.716 --> 00:16:20.457
- You don't even
notice me anymore.

39
00:16:24.766 --> 00:16:28.161
You've changed. Ever since
you just started to check out.

40
00:16:32.034 --> 00:16:35.342
Will. the office called me
today. It sounded pretty urgent.

41
00:16:37.126 --> 00:16:38.301
I hope you're not messing
things up at work. Will.

42
00:16:38.301 --> 00:16:39.781
You really don't need that.

43
00:16:39.781 --> 00:16:42.131
You've got some
serious bills to pay.

44
00:16:42.131 --> 00:16:43.915
And I'm not gonna
pay them for you.

45
00:16:45.134 --> 00:16:46.918
Will. put that thing down.

46
00:16:48.007 --> 00:16:49.269
- Sorry.

47
00:16:57.451 --> 00:17:00.236
- You've gotta face up to
your responsibilities. Will.

48
00:17:00.236 --> 00:17:02.673
Face up to your
responsibilities. Will.

49
00:17:02.673 --> 00:17:05.633
You can't just keep going
around like you don't have any.

50
00:17:05.633 --> 00:17:07.243
I'd like to settle down someday.

51
00:17:07.243 --> 00:17:08.244
I'd like to settle down someday.

52
00:17:08.244 --> 00:17:09.245
Maybe raise a family.

53
00:17:09.245 --> 00:17:10.420
Maybe raise a family.

54
00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:12.292
You're not a kid anymore. Will.

55
00:17:12.292 --> 00:17:14.294
You've gotta start to take
things a bit more seriously.

56
00:17:14.294 --> 00:17:15.295
Do you doubt that?

57
00:17:15.295 --> 00:17:15.991
Do you doubt that?

58
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.256
Are you even listening to me?

59
00:17:22.041 --> 00:17:22.867
- Sorry. what?

60
00:17:57.163 --> 00:18:00.514
Will. I'm not sure
this is working out anymore.

61
00:18:00.514 --> 00:18:03.299
I think maybe we should take
a break for a while. Okay?

62
00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.085
Sorry.

63
00:21:51.397 --> 00:21:52.659
- Are you okay?

64
00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:54.965
What's wrong?

65
00:21:54.965 --> 00:21:57.054
Has someone been hurt?

66
00:22:14.942 --> 00:22:16.596
Hey Will. it's Mike.

67
00:22:16.596 --> 00:22:18.467
I'm worried about you. buddy.

68
00:22:18.467 --> 00:22:20.077
Listen. I'm anxious to get
you briefed on this Patreon.

69
00:22:20.077 --> 00:22:22.210
Call me back as soon
as you hear this. Okay?

70
00:22:22.210 --> 00:22:23.559
Thanks buddy.

71
00:22:51.282 --> 00:22:52.980
- Will?
- Yes.

72
00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:54.590
- Hello. I'm Dr. Hope.

73
00:22:55.678 --> 00:22:57.593
Nice to meet you.

74
00:23:07.255 --> 00:23:11.259
- Now. what seems
to be the problem?

75
00:23:13.783 --> 00:23:14.610
- I can't sleep.

76
00:23:18.397 --> 00:23:21.008
I'm having these dreams
that I can't explain.

77
00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:24.925
I don't know if
they're real or not.

78
00:23:26.927 --> 00:23:28.798
I keep having a
dream about a girl.

79
00:23:32.411 --> 00:23:33.368
I'm losing my mind.

80
00:23:42.986 --> 00:23:45.032
- I may have something
that can help you.

81
00:24:23.984 --> 00:24:25.725
I'm going to
prescribe you these.

82
00:24:27.466 --> 00:24:29.293
They'll help you sort
out your sleeping issues.

83
00:24:31.034 --> 00:24:32.949
Make sure you follow the
instructions very carefully.

84
00:24:34.864 --> 00:24:37.606
They can have very
strong side effects.

85
00:24:37.606 --> 00:24:40.435
So let me know immediately
if that happens. Will. Okay?

86
00:24:41.392 --> 00:24:42.219
- I will.

87
00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:47.747
- Here's my card.

88
00:24:56.233 --> 00:24:57.060
- Thanks.

89
00:28:30.447 --> 00:28:33.537
Hey Will. it's Mike.
Are you sick or something?

90
00:28:33.537 --> 00:28:35.365
The client called said
we're in a great position.

91
00:28:35.365 --> 00:28:37.498
but we're not out
of the woods yet.

92
00:28:37.498 --> 00:28:39.108
A lot riding on this one. buddy.

93
00:28:39.108 --> 00:28:40.022
Do you doubt that?

94
00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.775
- My finest work.
Do you doubt that?

95
00:29:48.569 --> 00:29:51.398
- They're not
circles. They're Os.

96
00:30:10.809 --> 00:30:12.332
- Do you doubt that?

97
00:30:12.332 --> 00:30:13.855

98
00:30:13.855 --> 00:30:15.074

106
00:30:24.605 --> 00:30:26.128
- Do. do you doubt
that? Do you doubt that?

107
00:30:26.128 --> 00:30:27.695
- Do you doubt that?

Do you doubt that?

110
00:30:29.697 --> 00:30:30.872
- Do you doubt that?

111
00:30:32.265 --> 00:30:34.223
Do you doubt that?

112
00:30:34.223 --> 00:30:35.746
Do you doubt that?

Do you doubt that?

Do you doubt that?

115
00:30:43.885 --> 00:30:45.408
Do you doubt that?

116
00:31:01.772 --> 00:31:03.209
It's true.

117
00:31:03.209 --> 00:31:05.733
It's true. Do you doubt that?

118
00:31:24.056 --> 00:31:26.014
- Do you doubt that?

119
00:31:29.365 --> 00:31:31.193

Hey Will. it's Mike.

Do you doubt that?

152
00:33:24.872 --> 00:33:26.439

Do you doubt that?

154
00:33:56.947 --> 00:33:57.513
- Will?

155
00:33:59.037 --> 00:33:59.863
Will?

156
00:34:04.172 --> 00:34:07.349
She's trying to reach
you. Ignore her.

157
00:34:09.786 --> 00:34:12.876
Ignore the signs.
Stay away from her.

158
00:34:48.434 --> 00:34:50.349
Will. It's Mike.

159
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:53.265
Dude. I'm seriously concerned.
We're running out of time.

160
00:34:53.265 --> 00:34:54.266
Call me back.

161
00:35:03.797 --> 00:35:05.364
Do you doubt that?

162
00:35:05.364 --> 00:35:06.234
Do you doubt that?
Do you doubt that?

163
00:38:28.131 --> 00:38:32.745
- I told you. stay
away from her.

164
00:41:55.034 --> 00:41:58.385
- That's pretty messed up. Will.

165
00:41:58.385 --> 00:42:01.431
Although I'm sure the pills
and the booze aren't helping.

166
00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:02.955
- Well. the good news is.

167
00:42:02.955 --> 00:42:04.913
I finally found the
girl of my dreams.

168
00:42:04.913 --> 00:42:06.524
- Well. that's great. Will.

169
00:42:06.524 --> 00:42:09.918
- The only problem is.
I don't know her name.

170
00:42:09.918 --> 00:42:12.530
where she's from. or
if she even exists.

171
00:42:13.618 --> 00:42:14.793
Well it sounds like

172
00:42:14.793 --> 00:42:16.316
you're off to a great start.

173
00:42:16.316 --> 00:42:18.187
- Let me ask you a question.

174
00:42:19.667 --> 00:42:21.756
Where do you think we go
to when we go to sleep?

175
00:42:23.497 --> 00:42:24.542
- Mm. I don't know.

176
00:42:27.675 --> 00:42:30.112
- So my ex-wife
walks into a bar--

177
00:42:30.112 --> 00:42:31.157
- Not tonight. Steve.

178
00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:35.378
I've been thinking.

179
00:42:35.378 --> 00:42:38.033
What if cyberspace is just
a copy of outer space?

180
00:42:38.033 --> 00:42:40.645
I mean. the universe is
made up of code. right?

181
00:42:41.863 --> 00:42:43.473
Just a bunch of ones and zeros.

182
00:42:45.084 --> 00:42:46.955
If you can have a relationship
with someone online

183
00:42:46.955 --> 00:42:50.306
then it's entirely feasible
you could have a relationship

184
00:42:50.306 --> 00:42:52.352
with someone in the
dream world. right?

185
00:42:53.353 --> 00:42:55.050
It's the same thing.

186
00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:56.791
- I think you just
have way too much

187
00:42:56.791 --> 00:42:58.619
time on your hands. Will.

188
00:42:58.619 --> 00:43:00.534
- I don't know if she's a ghost.

189
00:43:00.534 --> 00:43:03.232
I don't know if she lives
in some other dimension.

190
00:43:03.232 --> 00:43:06.845
All I know is our minds
are connected in some way.

191
00:43:06.845 --> 00:43:10.022
And if she is real.
then I have to find her.

192
00:43:11.501 --> 00:43:13.242
- Be careful what
you wish for. Will.

193
00:43:17.377 --> 00:43:18.770
You sure you're
gonna be okay. bro?

194
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.641
- I'll be fine.

195
00:43:20.641 --> 00:43:22.948
- Maybe you should lay off
the cheese for a while.

196
00:49:45.286 --> 00:49:46.722
- Ophelia.

197
00:54:03.762 --> 00:54:06.243
Will. it's Mike.
The pitch is tomorrow.

198
00:54:06.243 --> 00:54:08.114
All I can say is.

199
00:54:08.114 --> 00:54:09.811
I hope you've been working
on something magical at home.

200
00:54:11.204 --> 00:54:12.205
- Excuse me.

201
00:54:24.739 --> 00:54:26.524
Have you seen this woman?

202
00:54:26.524 --> 00:54:27.525
- Sorry.

203
00:54:31.572 --> 00:54:33.835
- Have you seen this woman?

204
00:54:35.446 --> 00:54:37.012
- Sorry.

205
00:55:05.954 --> 00:55:06.781
- Excuse me.

206
00:55:08.305 --> 00:55:10.611
I'm looking for the
girl in this photo.

207
00:55:10.611 --> 00:55:12.439
Do you recognize her?

208
00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:17.314
- Yes I do.

209
00:55:18.837 --> 00:55:21.970
I'm sad to say. she
is no longer alive.

210
00:55:24.103 --> 00:55:26.584
She died uh. a while back.

211
00:55:27.715 --> 00:55:29.326
Car accident.

212
00:55:29.326 --> 00:55:30.675
Great shame.

213
00:55:30.675 --> 00:55:33.765
She was a wonderful young woman.

214
00:55:35.462 --> 00:55:36.724
I'm sorry.

215
00:55:43.209 --> 00:55:44.036
- Thank you.

216
00:55:48.693 --> 00:55:53.132
- Monarch. That was
her last name. Monarch.

217
00:56:17.374 --> 00:56:22.379
I stand amid the
roar of a surf-tormented shore.

218
00:56:24.206 --> 00:56:27.209
and I hold within my hand
grains of the golden sand.

219
00:56:27.209 --> 00:56:29.081
How few.

220
00:56:29.081 --> 00:56:31.779
Yet how they creep through
my fingers to the deep.

221
00:56:31.779 --> 00:56:34.739
while I weep. while I weep.

222
00:56:34.739 --> 00:56:39.308
Oh God. can I not grasp
them with a tighter clasp?

223
00:56:39.308 --> 00:56:43.922
Oh God. can I not save one
from the pitiless wave?

224
00:56:43.922 --> 00:56:48.927
Is all that we see or seem
but a dream within a dream?

225
00:57:10.992 --> 00:57:14.256
Will. it's
Mike. as you can imagine.

226
00:57:14.256 --> 00:57:16.737
the meeting did not go well.

227
00:57:16.737 --> 00:57:18.826
You let us all down. Will.

228
00:57:18.826 --> 00:57:21.350
You and I are done.
buddy. We are done.

229
00:57:52.991 --> 00:57:55.123
- Police. stop. Up
against the wall.

230
00:57:56.429 --> 00:57:57.474
Up against the wall.

231
00:58:00.868 --> 00:58:02.087
Feet back.

232
00:58:07.135 --> 00:58:08.223
Give me your left hand.

233
00:58:15.274 --> 00:58:16.710
Right hand.

234
00:58:21.367 --> 00:58:22.368
All right. let's go.

235
00:58:31.899 --> 00:58:36.904
So. Mr. Edgar. what brings
you all the way out here?

236
00:58:38.297 --> 00:58:39.864
- I was looking for a woman.

237
00:58:41.387 --> 00:58:43.084
- Does this woman have a name?

238
00:58:44.216 --> 00:58:45.652
- Well. she did.

239
00:58:48.742 --> 00:58:49.700
Ophelia Monarch.

240
00:58:51.179 --> 00:58:53.138
- Oh. Yeah. the
Monarch accident.

241
00:58:54.661 --> 00:58:57.316
That was a big blow to
a small town like this.

242
00:58:58.578 --> 00:59:00.232
The parents never got over it.

243
00:59:00.232 --> 00:59:01.712
They died soon thereafter.

244
00:59:03.191 --> 00:59:04.976
Some said the loss
of two daughters

245
00:59:04.976 --> 00:59:06.499
was just too much to bear.

246
00:59:08.762 --> 00:59:10.503
- Two daughters?

247
00:59:10.503 --> 00:59:12.418
- Yeah. they were twin sisters.

248
00:59:12.418 --> 00:59:14.768
Their car plunged over
a bridge into the river.

249
00:59:14.768 --> 00:59:17.031
It was very nasty.

250
00:59:19.033 --> 00:59:22.602
Odessa. the twin in the picture
here. she died instantly.

251
00:59:24.430 --> 00:59:28.695
Ophelia. the other sister.
she was in a coma for years.

252
00:59:30.088 --> 00:59:30.958
I don't know whatever
happened to her.

253
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:35.528
- So technically. she
could still be alive?

254
00:59:37.095 --> 00:59:40.272
- Technically. yes. But.
it's been many years.

255
00:59:41.926 --> 00:59:43.928
Perhaps I could run a
hospital check in the morning.

256
00:59:43.928 --> 00:59:45.277
- Would you. seriously?

257
00:59:46.974 --> 00:59:49.803
- I could do that. but we gotta
lock you up for the night.

258
00:59:49.803 --> 00:59:50.630
Let's go.

259
01:01:04.530 --> 01:01:08.186
There's a patient at St.
John's Hospital in a coma.

260
01:01:08.186 --> 01:01:10.667
Registered under the
name Ophelia Monarch.

261
01:01:12.538 --> 01:01:15.715
Here's the phone number of the
doctor in charge of the ward.

262
01:01:15.715 --> 01:01:16.629
- Thank you. sir.

263
01:01:19.327 --> 01:01:21.982
- Don't let me catch you
trashing my town again. okay?

264
01:01:22.896 --> 01:01:24.376
- No. sir.

265
01:01:24.376 --> 01:01:25.682
Thank you again. sir.

266
01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.031
- Let's go. Get outta here.

267
01:01:33.167 --> 01:01:34.908
Hello.
this is St John's Hospital.

268
01:01:34.908 --> 01:01:36.344
Can I help you?

269
01:01:36.344 --> 01:01:39.173
- Hello? This is William Edgar.

270
01:01:39.173 --> 01:01:41.785
I'd like to speak to
Dr. Marcellus. please.

271
01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:43.700
Can I
ask what it's regarding?

272
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:45.919
- It's regarding a patient
of his. Ophelia Monarch.

273
01:01:47.355 --> 01:01:48.705
Just a moment.

274
01:01:50.358 --> 01:01:52.273
- Hello. Mr. Edgar?

275
01:01:52.273 --> 01:01:53.840
- Yes?

276
01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.625
- Mr. Edgar. are you a
member of the family?

277
01:01:56.625 --> 01:01:58.453
- No.

278
01:01:58.453 --> 01:02:01.543
- Mr. Edgar it is most bizarre
that you're calling today.

279
01:02:02.457 --> 01:02:03.981
- Why is that?

280
01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:07.985
- Well you see. no one's
visited here in years.

281
01:02:07.985 --> 01:02:09.508
- And?

282
01:02:09.508 --> 01:02:11.728
- Well I'm sorry
to have to tell you

283
01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.512
that we've made
the tough decision

284
01:02:13.512 --> 01:02:15.862
to terminate the
life support system.

285
01:02:20.475 --> 01:02:21.955
- Oh.

286
01:02:21.955 --> 01:02:24.871
- I'm sorry. but we did
everything we could.

287
01:02:24.871 --> 01:02:27.004
- Well. can I at least see her?

288
01:02:27.004 --> 01:02:31.008
- Well. you're gonna have
to hurry. I'm afraid.

289
01:02:31.008 --> 01:02:32.618
- Why is that?

290
01:02:32.618 --> 01:02:36.491
- Well. the procedure is
set for 9:30 a.m. today.

291
01:02:57.599 --> 01:02:58.426
- Taxi.

292
01:03:01.734 --> 01:03:03.127
- Yeah. where to. bud?

293
01:03:03.127 --> 01:03:05.085
- St. John's Hospital.
Please hurry.

294
01:03:05.085 --> 01:03:06.608
- You got it. Hop in.

295
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:14.921
Here you are. Bud.
St. John's Hospital.

296
01:03:14.921 --> 01:03:15.792
- Thanks.

297
01:03:15.792 --> 01:03:17.097
- You got it.

298
01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:24.191
- No. no.

299
01:03:28.892 --> 01:03:29.893
Where's St. John's Hospital?

300
01:03:29.893 --> 01:03:31.068
- That way. two miles.

301
01:05:13.518 --> 01:05:15.433
- Wait. Wait.

302
01:05:15.433 --> 01:05:16.260
Please.

303
01:05:18.088 --> 01:05:21.613
Just one moment alone with
her. I need to say goodbye.

304
01:05:25.051 --> 01:05:25.922
Please.

305
01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:26.966
- Five minutes.

306
01:05:35.366 --> 01:05:36.193
- Ophelia.

307
01:08:15.439 --> 01:08:17.658
Take this
kiss upon the brow.

308
01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:21.184
And. in parting from you now.

309
01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:26.580
thus much let me avow.
you are not wrong.

310
01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:29.322
who deem that my days
have been a dream.

311
01:08:41.552 --> 01:08:45.512
Yet if hope has flown away
in a night. or in a day.

312
01:08:45.512 --> 01:08:49.777
in a vision. or in none. is
it therefore the less gone?

313
01:08:51.344 --> 01:08:52.867
- Help!

314
01:08:52.867 --> 01:08:53.868
All that
we see or seem

315
01:08:54.956 --> 01:08:58.612
Is but a dream within a dream.

316
01:10:00.544 --> 01:10:02.894
Do you doubt that?

317
01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:07.203
Do you doubt that?

318
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.793
Do you doubt that?

319
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:33.506
Sorry.

320
01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:14.259
- Do you doubt that?
