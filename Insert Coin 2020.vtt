00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.375
- Midway is the
punk rock. you know.

00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.625
They're like The Ramones
or The Sex Pistols

4
00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:07.750
of the video game industry.

5
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.041
the guys who are like.

00:00:09.041 --> 00:00:10.458
"Oh. this is how you
think we should do it?

8
00:00:10.458 --> 00:00:12.875
"These are the rules that
you think we should obey?

9
00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:14.250
"Well. what if we
go the other way?"

10
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.250
[music]
[character screaming]

11
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.208
- What was the culture
of Midway in the '90s?

12
00:00:21.208 --> 00:00:23.375
And my take on it
was aggressive.

13
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.166
- It's being. pushing the
boundaries of maybe good taste.

14
00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:34.291
- [Character] I love it.

15
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:36.916
[car screeching]

16
00:00:39.541 --> 00:00:41.333
- I don't think that there
a single gamer that exists

17
00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.125
that never played a Midway game.

18
00:00:47.333 --> 00:00:48.583
- They were the only
company. in a lot of ways.

19
00:00:48.583 --> 00:00:50.333
that could make
fantastic sports games

20
00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:51.541
that anyone could
pick up and play.

21
00:00:51.541 --> 00:00:54.250
[character yelling]

22
00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:04.250
- It looked so real to
me. that I was like.

23
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.666
Boop. you just killed me.

24
00:01:05.666 --> 00:01:08.666
[character yelling]

25
00:01:13.166 --> 00:01:15.916
- I remember thinking to myself.
wow. I'm working with gods.

26
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.291
- We made great games.

27
00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:29.000
And at one point.
we led the world.

28
00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:35.750
[gentle music]

29
00:01:44.583 --> 00:01:47.291
- I call it like the Big Bang
of the video game universe.

30
00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:50.458
I mean. we want
from blank screens

31
00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:53.375
to very rudimentary
games like Pong.

32
00:01:53.375 --> 00:01:55.833
to all of the sudden.
we've got Space Invaders.

33
00:01:55.833 --> 00:01:58.291
Pac-Man. Donkey Kong.

34
00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:00.083
You know. we came
out with Defender.

35
00:02:01.708 --> 00:02:03.500
- [Announcer] Within months
of appearing on the market

36
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.250
in 1981. his game Defender shot
to the top and stayed there.

37
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.333
For Williams. the
company that owned it.

38
00:02:10.333 --> 00:02:13.416
his idea was worth $100 million.

39
00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:16.125
- Well. it's sort of the.
it's the ultimate fantasy

40
00:02:16.125 --> 00:02:20.875
where you are the only force
left between evil and good.

41
00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:23.791
- You'd go into a place.

42
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:25.291
I mean. there'd be
eight Defenders.

43
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.916
People would be standing
in line. you know.

44
00:02:26.916 --> 00:02:28.250
three or four. five deep.

45
00:02:29.583 --> 00:02:30.500
It was a golden era.

46
00:02:35.708 --> 00:02:38.041
But then we got to '84.

47
00:02:38.041 --> 00:02:41.250
All this great stuff
got kind of buried

48
00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.208
under like this stinking
pile of shitty clones.

49
00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:48.375
and you know. six-week
Atari 2600 ports.

50
00:02:50.041 --> 00:02:51.666
- Anything was
selling at the time.

51
00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:53.750
as far as the home
market was concerned.

52
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.416
And people started just
shoving garbage out the door.

53
00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:58.291
And at some point in time.

54
00:02:58.291 --> 00:03:00.208
the customer got fed
up with the thing.

55
00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:05.333
- This year's hit is the
next year's firewood.

56
00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:07.041
- It's that tough.
this business?

57
00:03:07.041 --> 00:03:08.750
- It is. I mean
three years from now.

58
00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.541
you'll ask somebody
what Defender was.

59
00:03:10.541 --> 00:03:13.375
and they'll go.
hmm. I don't know.

60
00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:17.000
- The consumer got disenchanted
with what was going on

61
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.625
with. I think. the
consumer product.

62
00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:21.250
It affected how things were
going on in the arcades

63
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.500
and how the game's
earnings went down.

64
00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.541
And we did backtrack.

65
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.291
- The whole video game
crash. we just kind of like.

66
00:03:29.291 --> 00:03:31.541
wow. man. this is
like game over.

67
00:03:31.541 --> 00:03:34.250
And went back to school for
a couple years in California.

68
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.875
But I just couldn't get the
video game thing out of my head.

69
00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:42.958
So it was like. yeah. man.
we gotta do a new game.

70
00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.375
get the band back together.

71
00:03:44.375 --> 00:03:49.083
So back to working at what
was known as Williams.

72
00:03:50.708 --> 00:03:54.000
I just remember him. before
he started doing anything.

73
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.583
coming to New York when
I was still in New York.

74
00:03:57.583 --> 00:04:01.208
talking about the idea of
doing another video game.

75
00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:04.916
- Eugene came in and
wasn't really prepared.

76
00:04:04.916 --> 00:04:07.375
But he knew in his mind
what he wanted to do.

77
00:04:07.375 --> 00:04:11.041
And he wrote down on a big
piece of paper. N-A-R-C.

78
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:13.250
He held up the piece of
paper. and it says NARC.

79
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.041
And they said. "What's NARC"?

80
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:18.791
- Guy. you know. protecting
the world from this scourge

81
00:04:18.791 --> 00:04:21.958
of drugs and pushers
and drug dealers.

82
00:04:21.958 --> 00:04:24.291
I felt like video
games was always

83
00:04:24.291 --> 00:04:25.916
in some kind of fantasy
world. you know.

84
00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:28.583
It was always like. oh.
we're men in tights.

85
00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:30.625
We're running around with swords

86
00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:33.583
and casting spells on people.
and spears. and stuff.

87
00:04:33.583 --> 00:04:37.500
And like. why can't a video
game be about something real?

88
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.708
We wanted to make an
impression to the world

89
00:04:40.708 --> 00:04:42.000
that Williams was back.

90
00:04:45.708 --> 00:04:47.500
- My job was in field service.

91
00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.291
Like I answered the 800 number.

92
00:04:49.291 --> 00:04:52.750
And I would badger
the programmers at ni

93
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.416
to understand what they did.

94
00:04:54.416 --> 00:04:55.541
So then I would go to college

95
00:04:55.541 --> 00:04:57.583
and I would try to find classes

96
00:04:57.583 --> 00:05:01.166
that somehow matched
what these guys knew

97
00:05:01.166 --> 00:05:03.250
because I wanted to
know what that was.

98
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.250
You know. my goal was
to program a game.

99
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.250
And I just. there's
no way you can learn

100
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:08.583
You just have to
do it on your own.

101
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.875
- You think about the
casualness of this era.

102
00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:12.583
you know. you're kind of
like putting together a team

103
00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:17.041
and like man. I need a
programmer for this game.

104
00:05:17.041 --> 00:05:19.208
And then. you talk
to a couple people.

105
00:05:19.208 --> 00:05:22.791
and here's some kid. you
know. just got out of college.

106
00:05:22.791 --> 00:05:24.958
Actually. I think he's
still trying to finish

107
00:05:24.958 --> 00:05:26.875
the last couple of
courses [laughs]

108
00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:28.625
- I'm gonna be. this is.

109
00:05:28.625 --> 00:05:30.791
I did visualize that
as the opportunity.

110
00:05:30.791 --> 00:05:33.000
the video game opportunity
of a lifetime for me.

111
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.500
I mean. if Eugene's
starting video

112
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.333
and I'm not on the ground floor.

113
00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:40.583
I mean. if I wait six months
to go do summer school

114
00:05:40.583 --> 00:05:42.083
or whatever. I'm
gonna miss something.

115
00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:44.958
- Jack Haeger was
really the lead artist

116
00:05:44.958 --> 00:05:47.958
and then kind of
the art director.

117
00:05:47.958 --> 00:05:49.750
- Jack has a great history
where he went on to be

118
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.791
one of the founders
of the Amiga.

119
00:05:51.791 --> 00:05:52.791
- What more can you say?

120
00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:55.583
[audience laughing]

121
00:05:55.583 --> 00:06:00.083
- When we started. I guess
there wasn't a clear sense

122
00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:01.916
of what we were going to do.

123
00:06:01.916 --> 00:06:05.083
It was more let's develop
a hardware and a software.

124
00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:06.750
- I always thought
with video games.

125
00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.916
when you make them. someone
would come with this great.

126
00:06:07.916 --> 00:06:09.791
like this book. here it is.

127
00:06:09.791 --> 00:06:11.416
This is what we're gonna
make. and we start page one

128
00:06:11.416 --> 00:06:12.625
and we start making it.

129
00:06:12.625 --> 00:06:13.958
It was never like that.

130
00:06:13.958 --> 00:06:15.291
It was like. so what
do you guys wanna do

131
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:18.500
- At the time. then. the
Japanese games had such.

132
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.000
they had this animation down.

133
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.958
I mean. they had just armies
of incredibly talented artists.

134
00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:26.583
How can you compete?

135
00:06:26.583 --> 00:06:29.375
- I started playing
with video digitization.

136
00:06:29.708 --> 00:06:31.958
That became a huge thing
for me during my career.

137
00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:35.958
The idea of taking actual
images. video images.

138
00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:39.083
and getting them
into a video game.

139
00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:40.750
that was kind of revolutionary.

140
00:06:40.916 --> 00:06:43.375
- The only thing that had
happened like this prior

141
00:06:43.375 --> 00:06:44.958
was a game called Journey.

142
00:06:44.958 --> 00:06:47.583
They actually like digitized
the heads of five frames

143
00:06:47.583 --> 00:06:49.541
of the band members.
and they would like. go.

144
00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:52.458
[video game music]

145
00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:59.916
A normal company. right.
would go out and buy

146
00:06:59.916 --> 00:07:02.125
tens of thousands of
dollars worth of equipment

147
00:07:02.125 --> 00:07:03.583
and cameras and studio
setup and everything.

148
00:07:03.583 --> 00:07:06.166
But no. we worked
for Eugene Jarvis.

149
00:07:06.166 --> 00:07:09.750
He's like. "Yeah. go out. I
bought a camera at Target."

150
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.375
It's like one of these.

151
00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:13.250
you remember those RCA cameras
where you put the videotape

152
00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:14.583
in the side and you
held it like that?

153
00:07:14.583 --> 00:07:17.333
That's what we had.
right. it was [laughs]

154
00:07:17.333 --> 00:07:19.708
- We bought a treadmill
that we were able

155
00:07:19.708 --> 00:07:21.416
to take the top off.
'cause I realized

156
00:07:21.416 --> 00:07:24.791
we would have to film
people walking in place.

157
00:07:24.791 --> 00:07:29.625
And teaching actors how to
be a video game character.

158
00:07:29.625 --> 00:07:33.000
And to my mind. nobody had
done that up to that point.

159
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.041
- Jack Haeger approached
me one day and said.

160
00:07:36.041 --> 00:07:39.166
"Hey. Mark. I got this
concept for this character.

161
00:07:39.166 --> 00:07:40.625
"I think you'd be
perfect for it."

162
00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:42.250
- [Jack Haeger] I came up
with that character

163
00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:47.250
basically from the
old Ironsides TV show

164
00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:49.958
with Raymond Burr
in a wheelchair.

165
00:07:49.958 --> 00:07:52.875
And the wheelchair was
mounted with guns. of course.

166
00:07:52.875 --> 00:07:54.958
- It really was. at the
time. just another day.

167
00:07:54.958 --> 00:07:56.875
I don't think it hit
me till decades lat

168
00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:59.333
that oh my gosh. my
image is still in there.

169
00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:01.250
I have daughters now.
they're gonna see this.

170
00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.541
- I did have a question.

171
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:04.625
At that point. we had
filmed a few characters.

172
00:08:04.625 --> 00:08:06.958
We had filmed the environments.

173
00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:10.000
And I asked. okay. we're.

174
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.875
a rocket launcher is
one of your weapons now.

175
00:08:12.875 --> 00:08:15.875
And I said. "Okay. when a player
fires the rocket launcher.

176
00:08:15.875 --> 00:08:17.125
"what happens?"

177
00:08:17.125 --> 00:08:18.458
And people said.
"What do you mean?"

178
00:08:18.458 --> 00:08:21.000
I go. "Well. I can
make it look real.

179
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000
"These are real people."

180
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
The mission was to
no. make it look real

181
00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:30.583
- The body parts would fly.

182
00:08:30.583 --> 00:08:34.750
I mean. I guess this was one
of the first body part games.

183
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:36.291
I think maybe the first.

184
00:08:36.291 --> 00:08:38.166
- I remember George was like.

185
00:08:38.166 --> 00:08:39.625
"God. this is so cool.
I can't believe this!

186
00:08:39.625 --> 00:08:40.958
"It's so cool!"

187
00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:45.750
And I came up and I was really
being very gentle about it

188
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.125
and I just said. "I
mean. it is cool.

189
00:08:49.125 --> 00:08:52.875
"But do you think that's
a good thing to put

190
00:08:52.875 --> 00:08:55.958
"in an arcade where
little kids are there?"

191
00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:59.000
- You have to understand.
arcades at that point

192
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.541
were still very
democratic environments.

193
00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:07.041
Any family. any age could
walk in without concern.

194
00:09:07.041 --> 00:09:09.583
- And this escalated
into a huge argumen

195
00:09:09.583 --> 00:09:12.708
And I just remember. it was
a huge. huge screaming match.

196
00:09:12.708 --> 00:09:14.291
And all I'm saying is.

197
00:09:14.291 --> 00:09:15.375
"I'm just saying we
should think about i

198
00:09:15.375 --> 00:09:17.375
"I'm not trying to
limit your creativity

199
00:09:17.375 --> 00:09:19.000
"I'm not trying to censor you."

200
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.875
- You know. I think.
and I think. too.

201
00:09:24.875 --> 00:09:29.250
with a game that involved
realistic content.

202
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:34.041
when we crossed that
bridge of digitizing life.

203
00:09:34.041 --> 00:09:37.541
the game was no
longer an escape.

204
00:09:37.541 --> 00:09:40.500
- I remember actually a member
of the board of directors

205
00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.250
of Williams called the game
a surrealistic nightmare.

206
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.958
And he was really concerned
that there might be some.

207
00:09:49.958 --> 00:09:53.416
you know. negative ramifications
from releasing this game

208
00:09:53.416 --> 00:09:58.166
to the public. and felt that
the game should be canceled.

209
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.583
- With the coin-op business.

210
00:10:04.583 --> 00:10:08.250
you're selling that game
a quarter at a time.

211
00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:10.541
With the home business.
once you sell the cartridge.

212
00:10:10.541 --> 00:10:12.291
if it was back in the old days.

213
00:10:12.291 --> 00:10:14.250
it was a cartridge
that fit into a Sega.

214
00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.333
fit into a Nintendo.

215
00:10:16.333 --> 00:10:19.958
And it was a crappy game.
okay. you made your money.

216
00:10:20.166 --> 00:10:23.000
Coin-op. it was one
quarter at a time.

217
00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:26.791
And if that game sucked.
the second quarter

218
00:10:26.791 --> 00:10:29.541
or the third quarter. the
fourth quarter wouldn't happen.

219
00:10:29.541 --> 00:10:33.375
And in our case. we wouldn't
even get out of the test phase.

220
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.291
- We had this magic
number of like $700.

221
00:10:39.291 --> 00:10:41.958
I don't know how
that number came up.

222
00:10:41.958 --> 00:10:44.750
But we wanted to
earn $700 in a week.

223
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.833
That would be. if
we could do that.

224
00:10:46.833 --> 00:10:49.541
we felt like we've
got something.

225
00:10:49.541 --> 00:10:52.791
- So we put it out there.

226
00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:54.166
I remember. actually.

227
00:10:54.166 --> 00:10:55.291
I actually think we
had some champagne.

228
00:10:55.291 --> 00:10:56.791
You know. we were
drinking champagne

229
00:10:56.791 --> 00:10:59.166
in this high school arcade.

230
00:11:00.666 --> 00:11:02.250
- I remember the first
two guys that played it.

231
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.791
They were literally
drug dealers.

232
00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:07.958
I was like [laughs].
these guys walk in.

233
00:11:07.958 --> 00:11:09.875
I'm like. these are
some bad characters.

234
00:11:09.875 --> 00:11:11.875
They're like. oh. check
this out. you know.

235
00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:13.500
and they start playing it.

236
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.500
- The cool thing was the
kids really dug the game.

237
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:20.083
And just this whole new world
of kind of like reality.

238
00:11:20.083 --> 00:11:21.625
No one had ever seen
anything like that

239
00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:23.166
in a video game before.

240
00:11:23.166 --> 00:11:25.000
- Even with all of the problems
in the software and stuff.

241
00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.541
I think the first week.
it earned like $742.

242
00:11:29.250 --> 00:11:31.416
And we're like we've done it!
[triumphant video game music]

243
00:11:31.416 --> 00:11:32.958
We are successful!

244
00:11:32.958 --> 00:11:35.500
Yeah. that was the first
time that we actually started

245
00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.208
like going. maybe. you know.
maybe there's something here.

246
00:11:38.208 --> 00:11:39.333
And that's when we
got confident enough

247
00:11:39.333 --> 00:11:41.000
to actually make
a plan to sell it.

248
00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:44.750
I think then management
all of the sudde

249
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:46.625
all of the sudden.
he actually goes.

250
00:11:46.625 --> 00:11:48.791
"Well. maybe we should order
some parts for this game.

251
00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:50.541
"Maybe we should actually
plan to build this game

252
00:11:50.541 --> 00:11:52.166
"at some point."

253
00:11:52.166 --> 00:11:52.875
- I don't know if they thought
about canceling the game.

254
00:11:52.875 --> 00:11:54.458
but it made so much money.

255
00:11:54.458 --> 00:11:56.958
I think that thought
kind of quickly vanished.

256
00:11:58.416 --> 00:11:59.958
[Reporter] - The new game is called NARC.

257
00:11:59.958 --> 00:12:02.625
It's manufactured by
a company in Chicago

258
00:12:02.625 --> 00:12:04.416
by Williams Electronics.

259
00:12:04.416 --> 00:12:07.083
And it's currently the
number one video arcade game

260
00:12:07.083 --> 00:12:07.875
in the country.

261
00:12:08.208 --> 00:12:08.916
- People were talking
about this game

262
00:12:08.958 --> 00:12:11.000
that was extremely violent.

263
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.500
And people could explode
and this all other stuff.

264
00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.916
But it was okay. because they
were drug dealers [laughs]

265
00:12:15.916 --> 00:12:17.125
- [Reporter] For some players.

266
00:12:17.125 --> 00:12:19.000
the carnage is
part of the appeal.

267
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.625
- I love the gore and the blood

268
00:12:20.625 --> 00:12:22.208
and the guts
spilling everywhere.

269
00:12:22.208 --> 00:12:24.208
Then when you hit people.
they go flying through the air

270
00:12:24.208 --> 00:12:25.416
and their heads smash
on the pavement.

271
00:12:25.416 --> 00:12:26.458
It's really cool.

272
00:12:26.875 --> 00:12:28.083
- Still ahead of its time.
Pac-Man sitting next to it.

273
00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:29.500
and things like Donkey Kong.

274
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:30.916
And now here's NARC.

275
00:12:30.916 --> 00:12:33.791
It was like fast sports
cars. drug dealers

276
00:12:33.791 --> 00:12:35.041
trying to like take you down.

277
00:12:35.041 --> 00:12:36.250
and body parts
flying everywhere.

278
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:37.333
And it looked like a movie.

279
00:12:37.666 --> 00:12:40.000
[guns shooting]
[characters yelling]

280
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
- We weren't aware of
the changing groundswell

281
00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.125
and the appetite for

282
00:12:47.583 --> 00:12:50.958
aggressive or realistic
types of games were.

283
00:12:50.958 --> 00:12:54.750
and what NARC brought
to that evolution.

284
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:59.458
[characters yelling]
[guns firing]

285
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.375
- One of the things that
Williams was so successful

286
00:13:04.375 --> 00:13:09.333
at doing was hiring very
creative. dynamic designers.

287
00:13:09.333 --> 00:13:11.791
But in order to do that.
creative people have a tendency

288
00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:16.791
sometimes to be kind of
off the wall situation.

289
00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:18.250
But we tried to
bring those people in

290
00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:19.958
because we knew that
they could design

291
00:13:19.958 --> 00:13:21.333
the most successful games.

292
00:13:21.333 --> 00:13:22.666
- Ken goes. "Oh. I want
you to meet this guy.

293
00:13:22.666 --> 00:13:24.291
"He's flying in. his
name's Mark Turmell

294
00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:25.958
"He's coming from California."

295
00:13:26.416 --> 00:13:29.041
And here comes this
larger than life dude

296
00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:33.125
tall. big like
permed blond hair.

297
00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:35.500
- What's funny. the
interview process in Chicago

298
00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:38.625
was a little bit crazy because
I was kinda Mr. California.

299
00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:40.458
I had kinda long hair.

300
00:13:40.458 --> 00:13:43.333
And I think I came in there
with some white pants on

301
00:13:43.333 --> 00:13:46.583
and a blue vest. and. you
know. kinda looking funny.

302
00:13:46.583 --> 00:13:48.625
- Pretty much the
conclusion was this guy

303
00:13:49.333 --> 00:13:51.250
you know. like he's
Hollywood. he's crazy

304
00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:53.541
He'll never be able to
actually do any real work.

305
00:13:55.041 --> 00:13:57.625
- No. no.

306
00:13:57.625 --> 00:13:59.041
- They did not wanna hire Mark.

307
00:13:59.041 --> 00:14:00.291
We said. "No. we're hiring Mark.

308
00:14:00.291 --> 00:14:01.625
"whether you like it or not."

309
00:14:01.625 --> 00:14:03.458
- We're going. "Oh.
this is a big mistake."

310
00:14:04.875 --> 00:14:06.625
But you know. actually.
he turned out to be

311
00:14:08.375 --> 00:14:09.583
one of the most brilliant
designers we ever had.

312
00:14:09.583 --> 00:14:11.500
- Even when I interviewed.

313
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.583
I said I wanted to revive
the dual joystick mechanic.

314
00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:18.083
The dual joystick
mechanic of Robotron i

315
00:14:18.083 --> 00:14:19.791
again. it's one of my favorites.

316
00:14:19.791 --> 00:14:20.958
- Crazy thing about Robotron.

317
00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:23.500
I remember when we came up with

318
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:25.041
that dual stick control
thing. and we felt. okay.

319
00:14:25.041 --> 00:14:26.750
this is going to be
the new standard.

320
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:29.625
Every video game from now
on will have to have this.

321
00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:32.708
Yet no one copied it.

322
00:14:32.708 --> 00:14:34.291
- Robotron. when I
think about that.

323
00:14:34.291 --> 00:14:35.708
it's sensory overload.

324
00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:38.250
There's so many rainbow
of colors coming at you.

325
00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:40.041
and the sound effects.

326
00:14:40.041 --> 00:14:41.416
And so I was kind
of in that vein

327
00:14:41.416 --> 00:14:44.333
of trying to duplicate
that experience.

328
00:14:44.333 --> 00:14:47.250
And so we started kind of
plugging away at the game.

329
00:14:47.250 --> 00:14:50.208
And it only took maybe
a couple of weeks

330
00:14:50.208 --> 00:14:52.083
before I realized
this John Tobias guy

331
00:14:52.083 --> 00:14:54.416
was just a rock star.

332
00:14:54.416 --> 00:14:56.791
- You know. the first game
I worked on was SmashTV.

333
00:14:56.791 --> 00:14:58.083
The funny thing about it was

334
00:14:58.083 --> 00:15:00.000
I always looked at
it as temporary.

335
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.083
I thought I'm gonna
do this for a while.

336
00:15:02.083 --> 00:15:03.708
I'm gonna save my money.

337
00:15:03.708 --> 00:15:05.291
And I'm either gonna
draw comic books.

338
00:15:05.291 --> 00:15:08.208
or I'm going to CalArts.

339
00:15:08.208 --> 00:15:09.791
- I remember when
we brought him in.

340
00:15:09.791 --> 00:15:11.458
I thought he hated me.

341
00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:13.791
I thought he was like.

342
00:15:13.791 --> 00:15:16.750
'cause he doesn't
smile that much.

343
00:15:16.750 --> 00:15:18.500
He doesn't talk that much.

344
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.041
And I just go. wow. this
guy. I think he hates me.

345
00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:23.541
- I remember thinking
to myself. wow.

346
00:15:23.541 --> 00:15:25.250
I'm working with gods.

347
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:26.875
I mean. I thought
that these are gods.

348
00:15:26.875 --> 00:15:31.125
And just was super excited
about working with them.

349
00:15:31.125 --> 00:15:34.083
- A big film at the time.
of course. was Running Man.

350
00:15:34.083 --> 00:15:36.708
Robocop was in that same era.

351
00:15:36.708 --> 00:15:38.625
- I'd buy that for a dollar.

352
00:15:40.750 --> 00:15:43.250
- We just had the idea
to take these characters

353
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.125
and turn them into a game show.

354
00:15:46.583 --> 00:15:48.750
- I'd buy that for a dollar.

355
00:15:50.125 --> 00:15:52.541
[video game shooting]

356
00:15:52.541 --> 00:15:56.333
- This consumerism gone
crazy. futuristic world where.

357
00:15:58.125 --> 00:16:00.666
you know. a toaster is more
important than human life.

358
00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:02.416
[cheering]

359
00:16:02.416 --> 00:16:05.416
- You know. Eugene was the king.

360
00:16:05.416 --> 00:16:07.625
We would all go
to him for advice.

361
00:16:07.625 --> 00:16:11.416
- We were just starting
the Boss Master.

362
00:16:11.416 --> 00:16:13.333
which I guess was Mutoid Man.

363
00:16:16.541 --> 00:16:19.125
And we reached the point
where you blew off his head.

364
00:16:19.125 --> 00:16:21.541
- And so I remember creating
the little blood spatters

365
00:16:21.541 --> 00:16:26.208
and watching the characters
onscreen kinda explode.

366
00:16:26.208 --> 00:16:27.541
I remember the first
time I had done it.

367
00:16:27.541 --> 00:16:29.250
I kinda minimized the impact.

368
00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.250
because I thought. oh.
that's looking pretty gory.

369
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.875
and I dialed it back.

370
00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:36.500
- I think John was opposed to
just how many bloody chunks

371
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.083
I put on the screen.

372
00:16:38.083 --> 00:16:40.083
- Everybody goes. "Oh. that's
amazing. that's awesome."

373
00:16:41.416 --> 00:16:42.916
And I was going.
"Yeah. it's all right."

374
00:16:42.916 --> 00:16:47.500
Then I go. "You know. multiply
that by 100." [laughs]

375
00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:50.750
- They pushed. hey more.
more blood. more blood.

376
00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:53.416
- This boiling fountain
of blood. you know.

377
00:16:53.416 --> 00:16:56.583
it was like. that's gonna
get people's attention.

378
00:16:56.583 --> 00:16:58.541
But it. oh man. it
looked so alive.

379
00:16:58.541 --> 00:17:01.958
It was just like this cauldron
of just boiling blood.

380
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.583
- He said. "Now. you
know what a game is

381
00:17:05.583 --> 00:17:07.250
I said. "No."

382
00:17:07.250 --> 00:17:09.250
He said. "A game is 100 of
those fucking cool things.

383
00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:10.541
"And now you have one."

384
00:17:10.541 --> 00:17:12.250
And he walked out of my office.

385
00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:14.291
So I was like. okay. so
I'm on the right track.

386
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.125
- In terms of how the
games did earn money.

387
00:17:18.125 --> 00:17:19.791
we call that percentaging.

388
00:17:19.791 --> 00:17:22.333
And that was largely

389
00:17:24.875 --> 00:17:26.708
up to the game designer
to pay attention

390
00:17:26.708 --> 00:17:28.250
to moments in the game

391
00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:31.333
where you might want
to lock down a player.

392
00:17:31.333 --> 00:17:33.541
and you might want to give
them a greater challenge.

393
00:17:33.541 --> 00:17:36.000
- We wanted to crush the player.

394
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.583
And if you're like crushed
by some little guy.

395
00:17:38.583 --> 00:17:42.500
or you get shot in the
back by a ant or something.

396
00:17:44.291 --> 00:17:46.708
I mean. it's like. wait a
minute. that's not fair.

397
00:17:46.708 --> 00:17:48.333
That guy couldn't have
killed me. that guy's a wimp.

398
00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:51.708
But if it's some monstrous
guy that's 30 feet tall

399
00:17:51.708 --> 00:17:55.916
on like tank treads running
around. and he kills you.

400
00:17:55.916 --> 00:17:57.958
it's like. well. you
know. the dude was badass.

401
00:17:57.958 --> 00:17:59.541
I mean. that was a badass dude.

402
00:17:59.541 --> 00:18:01.583
I mean. obviously he's
gonna kill me a few times

403
00:18:01.583 --> 00:18:03.000
before I figure
out how to do it.

404
00:18:04.541 --> 00:18:06.416
You accepted it.

405
00:18:06.416 --> 00:18:09.000
You accepted your death
and gladly paid for more.

406
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.791
- Arcade games were built around

407
00:18:10.791 --> 00:18:12.416
you play for this chunk of time.

408
00:18:12.416 --> 00:18:14.291
and then you give
us another quarter.

409
00:18:14.291 --> 00:18:17.750
It's like. aw man. I was
hoodwinked for decades.

410
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:20.250
Like people complain about
mobile game microtransactions.

411
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:22.708
but arcade games were doing
that decades before that

412
00:18:22.708 --> 00:18:24.750
in way more nefarious ways.

413
00:18:25.208 --> 00:18:28.375
- Supposedly. within
SmashTV. was this

414
00:18:28.416 --> 00:18:31.083
Pleasure Dome that

415
00:18:31.583 --> 00:18:33.166
never existed.

416
00:18:33.166 --> 00:18:34.416
- Well. I guess I'm
a bit of a scammer.

417
00:18:34.416 --> 00:18:36.208
I just kind of did it on a whim

418
00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:39.958
because I couldn't bring
myself to just having a message

419
00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.958
that said
congratulations. go away.

420
00:18:42.958 --> 00:18:45.416
and never play this game again.

421
00:18:45.416 --> 00:18:48.541
It didn't make sense
to just shun people

422
00:18:48.541 --> 00:18:51.250
- And he figured.
eh. you know what.

423
00:18:51.250 --> 00:18:52.791
we'll just tell them it's there.

424
00:18:52.791 --> 00:18:54.291
And since it's so
late in the game.

425
00:18:54.291 --> 00:18:56.375
the majority of players
will never even know.

426
00:18:56.375 --> 00:19:00.166
[Ernest Cline] - I remember
just feeding mountains

427
00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:02.958
of tokens and quarters
into SmashTV in the arcade

428
00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:05.125
trying to get to the
Pleasure Dome

429
00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:06.666
and could never make it there.

430
00:19:07.791 --> 00:19:10.416
And I figured. well. I
didn't try hard enough.

431
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:14.333
- So when Ken Fedesna found
out that I had done that

432
00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:16.333
and that there was
no Pleasure Dome.

433
00:19:16.333 --> 00:19:19.791
he said. "You've gotta
resolve it somehow."

434
00:19:19.791 --> 00:19:23.291
And so we put
together a new room.

435
00:19:23.291 --> 00:19:24.875
and we actually supported it.

436
00:19:24.875 --> 00:19:29.416
But of course. not every
distributor or arcade owner

437
00:19:29.416 --> 00:19:33.250
would get the new EPROMS
to upgrade their machine.

438
00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:35.541
- You know. with a lot
of things that happened

439
00:19:35.541 --> 00:19:38.416
in those days. we
may not like it.

440
00:19:38.416 --> 00:19:40.125
But if the game
ended up doing well.

441
00:19:41.625 --> 00:19:43.583
we kind of would shrug
our shoulders and say.

442
00:19:43.583 --> 00:19:46.791
"Okay. well. let's move
on to the next thing.

443
00:19:46.791 --> 00:19:48.208
"Don't do that again."

444
00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:50.000
We wouldn't make that
big of a deal of it

445
00:19:53.041 --> 00:19:56.500
[Ernest Cline] - So I
managed to find a guy

446
00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:59.791
much like myself. who like

447
00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:01.416
had probably spent
his whole life.

448
00:20:01.416 --> 00:20:04.000
like I'm gonna find these
goddamn Pleasure Domes.

449
00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.500
And he somehow found a
version of the ROM chips

450
00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.625
that had the Pleasure
Domes in them. the upgrade.

451
00:20:09.958 --> 00:20:12.291
I remember getting
this chip in the mail

452
00:20:12.291 --> 00:20:13.791
and swapping it out
and booting it up

453
00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:15.458
and seeing the new version.

454
00:20:15.458 --> 00:20:18.583
And then finally. finally. I
reached the Pleasure Domes.

455
00:20:18.583 --> 00:20:21.416
And it was really just a bunch
of like girls in bikini icons

456
00:20:21.416 --> 00:20:23.083
that you could run
around and scoop up.

457
00:20:23.083 --> 00:20:26.875
[triumphant video game music]

458
00:20:28.250 --> 00:20:29.083
It was pretty...

459
00:20:29.666 --> 00:20:30.166
...lame

460
00:20:31.458 --> 00:20:33.125
Whoever was responsible
for. you know.

461
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:37.250
for that quest taking
me like 20 years

462
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.666
to reach the Pleasure Dome.
you should just be ashamed.

463
00:20:39.666 --> 00:20:41.583
And if you never reached
the Pleasure Domes.

464
00:20:41.583 --> 00:20:43.041
if you're one of those people.

465
00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:45.000
I will tell you. it was not
worth it once you get there.

466
00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.125
It's just a. yeah. just shitty.

467
00:20:48.125 --> 00:20:50.250
All right. [laughing]

468
00:20:57.041 --> 00:21:00.166
- There was a grittiness
about producing product.

469
00:21:00.166 --> 00:21:02.625
about making games at
Williams Electronics.

470
00:21:02.625 --> 00:21:05.791
that I think certainly had an
effect on the types of games

471
00:21:05.791 --> 00:21:06.958
that we produced.

472
00:21:06.958 --> 00:21:09.041
- We were in a big factory.

473
00:21:09.041 --> 00:21:10.958
We had rats coming
through ceilings.

474
00:21:10.958 --> 00:21:14.000
We had water leaks. floods.

475
00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.916
It was part of
what Neil fostered.

476
00:21:16.916 --> 00:21:21.666
was a hungry. dirty.
grungy atmosphere.

477
00:21:23.458 --> 00:21:25.958
- Yeah. being in Chicago. I
think it comes out of the grit

478
00:21:25.958 --> 00:21:30.208
of the manufacturing process.

479
00:21:30.208 --> 00:21:33.500
- I think it's a lot to
do with the personalities

480
00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.625
of all the people. and the
collective personalities.

481
00:21:36.625 --> 00:21:41.375
as we all kind of went for
the down and dirty sometimes.

482
00:21:41.375 --> 00:21:45.125
- We weren't afraid and we
weren't troubled by the idea

483
00:21:45.125 --> 00:21:48.125
of having people compete.
because. you know.

484
00:21:48.125 --> 00:21:50.041
we thought that it
would be helpful

485
00:21:50.041 --> 00:21:52.750
enhancing their animal spirits.

486
00:21:52.750 --> 00:21:54.416
to really come up
with something special

487
00:21:54.416 --> 00:21:57.250
- When you go back
to the pinball days.

488
00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:59.833
you know. in the '60s and
'70s. and all that other stuff.

489
00:21:59.833 --> 00:22:02.625
you had basically three
major pinball companies.

490
00:22:02.625 --> 00:22:05.250
You had Gottlieb. you had
Bally. and you had Williams.

491
00:22:05.250 --> 00:22:07.333
Bally was the
leaders at the time.

492
00:22:07.333 --> 00:22:08.625
They were the first
ones to come out

493
00:22:08.625 --> 00:22:10.708
with solid state
pinball machines.

494
00:22:10.708 --> 00:22:12.291
They acquired Midway.

495
00:22:12.291 --> 00:22:13.916
and then they were
running the whole thing.

496
00:22:13.916 --> 00:22:16.375
And they then were able
to get Space Invaders.

497
00:22:16.375 --> 00:22:18.000
and of course. Pac-Man.
and all the other stuff

498
00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.625
that went on at the time.

499
00:22:19.625 --> 00:22:24.375
- The rivalry between
Bally Midway and Williams

500
00:22:24.541 --> 00:22:29.250
was. you know. a really
longstanding. highly competitive

501
00:22:30.583 --> 00:22:33.916
love/hate. maybe more hate
than love relationship.

502
00:22:33.916 --> 00:22:36.083
- [Reporter] Well. this is
supposed to be Bally's big new.

503
00:22:36.083 --> 00:22:37.791
you know. answer to Pac-Man

504
00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:39.083
and all of that kind of stuff.

505
00:22:39.083 --> 00:22:40.541
the next Pac-Man.
the next generation.

506
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:43.375
Think you'll ever
play Roto again?

507
00:22:45.541 --> 00:22:46.958
- I probably would. you know.

508
00:22:48.125 --> 00:22:50.000
I'm trying to figure out
what's going on. you know.

509
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.583
- Everyone at Bally
Midway had been

510
00:22:52.583 --> 00:22:54.375
looking at Williams
for years as Them.

511
00:22:54.375 --> 00:22:56.333
They were the other guys.

512
00:22:56.333 --> 00:22:59.000
They did these type of games

513
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.916
that required enormous skill.

514
00:23:00.916 --> 00:23:03.791
And I did games that were
idiot-proof and silly and funny.

515
00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:06.875
- And so we really wanted
to bury those guys.

516
00:23:06.875 --> 00:23:08.541
We wanted to bury Bally Midway.

517
00:23:08.541 --> 00:23:13.291
We felt that they relied on
licensing brands too much.

518
00:23:15.083 --> 00:23:19.208
So we just felt they were
phonies and incompetents

519
00:23:19.416 --> 00:23:21.791
and we were going to
teach them a lesson

520
00:23:21.791 --> 00:23:24.416
- And they were
them and we were us.

521
00:23:24.416 --> 00:23:27.916
and all of a sudden.
now they were buying us.

522
00:23:27.916 --> 00:23:29.458
[Ken Fedesna] - They were
diversifying into

523
00:23:29.458 --> 00:23:30.875
health clubs and casinos.

524
00:23:30.958 --> 00:23:33.125
♪ Bally's. Bally's

525
00:23:33.125 --> 00:23:35.708
- They decided to get out
of the coin-op industry.

526
00:23:35.708 --> 00:23:38.375
So it became available
for us to buy.

527
00:23:38.375 --> 00:23:40.250
and that's why we ended
up purchasing them.

528
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:43.625
- Yeah. we won the war.
we killed these guys.

529
00:23:43.625 --> 00:23:47.125
And then the crazy thing
is. then we like hired

530
00:23:47.125 --> 00:23:50.750
all their managers and they
became our managers [laughs]

531
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:54.250
And then it was. I don't
know. it wasn't a year or two

532
00:23:54.250 --> 00:24:00.125
before we had our name
changed to Midway [laughs]

533
00:24:02.666 --> 00:24:05.541
[Neil Nicastro] - We changed the
branding of our video games

534
00:24:05.541 --> 00:24:07.333
from Williams to Midway

535
00:24:07.333 --> 00:24:11.583
because Midway had a
stronger consumer presence.

536
00:24:11.583 --> 00:24:14.208
- I think I could see
Eugene's emotion in it.

537
00:24:14.208 --> 00:24:17.583
We were fighting a
war for our jobs.

538
00:24:17.583 --> 00:24:19.541
to get video started.

539
00:24:19.541 --> 00:24:21.250
It was the Williams name.

540
00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:23.541
And a lot of us. we all
took very much pride

541
00:24:23.541 --> 00:24:24.833
in the Williams name.

542
00:24:24.833 --> 00:24:26.625
- We won this war.
we're Williams.

543
00:24:26.625 --> 00:24:28.291
Why are we Bally Midway?

544
00:24:28.291 --> 00:24:31.250
I mean. they should. Bally
Midway becoming Williams.

545
00:24:31.250 --> 00:24:34.291
And he goes. "You know what.
I paid five million bucks

546
00:24:34.291 --> 00:24:36.500
"for that fucking name.
we're gonna use it."

547
00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.625
[laughs]

548
00:24:40.375 --> 00:24:42.583
- The only people that we
were able to actually attract

549
00:24:42.583 --> 00:24:44.916
was Brian Colin and Jeff Nauman.

550
00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:47.041
who had done Rampage
and Xenophobe

551
00:24:47.041 --> 00:24:49.250
prior to the acquisition.
and then came over.

552
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:50.958
and their first game
with us was Arch Rival.

553
00:24:50.958 --> 00:24:53.041
which was a big
success at the time.

554
00:24:53.041 --> 00:24:55.708
- The income from Arch
Rivals basically paid for

555
00:24:55.708 --> 00:24:58.333
the entire price of the merger.

556
00:24:58.333 --> 00:25:00.125
So really. it was a free deal.

557
00:25:00.125 --> 00:25:02.875
It was actually. Williams
got Bally Midway for nothing.

558
00:25:02.875 --> 00:25:05.250
[laughs]

559
00:25:05.250 --> 00:25:08.000
- I'll have to send you
the waving goodbye photo.

560
00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.541
You'll appreciate it.

561
00:25:09.541 --> 00:25:12.291
It shows what people
thought about the buyout.

562
00:25:16.333 --> 00:25:18.916
[George Petro] - I got
a call. my phone rang

563
00:25:18.916 --> 00:25:21.250
and it was Neil
Nicastro. the CEO.

564
00:25:21.250 --> 00:25:23.333
And he goes. "Hey.
what would you think

565
00:25:23.333 --> 00:25:25.041
"about doing a
Terminator 2 game?"

566
00:25:25.041 --> 00:25:28.500
And I was like. "There's
gonna be a Terminator 2?"

567
00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.791
- Arrangements were made
for George and I to fly out

568
00:25:32.791 --> 00:25:36.541
to Hollywood to meet with
Jim Cameron and his people

569
00:25:36.541 --> 00:25:38.500
and to show demonstrations

570
00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:43.000
of what our digitizing hardware
and software was capable of.

571
00:25:43.416 --> 00:25:45.500
- We put on this videotape
of us creating NARC.

572
00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.625
And Jim Cameron sees it
and he just freaks out.

573
00:25:48.625 --> 00:25:51.708
He's just like. he's
like. "This is awesome."

574
00:25:51.708 --> 00:25:53.375
- Cameron was great.

575
00:25:53.375 --> 00:25:54.500
I mean. it was like. you
guys are making movies

576
00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.416
like we are.

577
00:25:56.416 --> 00:25:58.416
- And he just stands up
at one point. he goes.

578
00:25:58.416 --> 00:26:01.500
"Give these guys
everything they need."

579
00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:03.791
And we're like.
Jack and I are like.

580
00:26:03.791 --> 00:26:05.416
- What was interesting
to us when we mad

581
00:26:05.416 --> 00:26:07.708
the Terminator 2 arcade
game is I'm pretty sure

582
00:26:07.708 --> 00:26:09.375
it was the first
movie that ever had

583
00:26:09.583 --> 00:26:11.208
on the set of the movie.

584
00:26:11.208 --> 00:26:13.291
shooting simultaneously
through the movie

585
00:26:13.291 --> 00:26:14.958
the arcade game people.

586
00:26:14.958 --> 00:26:16.708
- We had access to all of
the actors and everything

587
00:26:16.708 --> 00:26:18.375
from the movie.

588
00:26:18.375 --> 00:26:21.625
But like Arnold. we didn't
really have access to him.

589
00:26:21.625 --> 00:26:24.208
He was a little more
expensive. more difficult.

590
00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:27.583
But we had access to his stunt
double that we could use.

591
00:26:27.583 --> 00:26:30.250
And once he put. he had a
prosthetic jaw that he put on.

592
00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:32.291
and he could look
exactly like Arnold.

593
00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:34.916
[shooting]

594
00:26:34.916 --> 00:26:36.791
- What's not commonly known
is that Linda Hamilton

595
00:26:36.791 --> 00:26:39.416
actually has a twin sister.
who's a stunt double

596
00:26:39.416 --> 00:26:40.750
and also her stand-in.

597
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.583
And in fact. at the
end of Terminator 2.

598
00:26:42.583 --> 00:26:46.250
there is a sequence where
the T-1000 replicates itself

599
00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:47.500
as Sarah Connor.

600
00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.416
and then the real Sarah
Connor comes behind.

601
00:26:49.416 --> 00:26:51.333
And actually. there's no trick
photography in that shot.

602
00:26:51.333 --> 00:26:53.250
That's actually her
and her twin sister.

603
00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.291
So her twin sister came
in and did all the stuff

604
00:26:55.291 --> 00:26:56.666
and was quite happy to do it.

605
00:26:58.375 --> 00:27:01.291
- Robert Patrick
was so enthusiastic.

606
00:27:01.291 --> 00:27:03.375
he kept asking me. "So
it's gonna look like me?"

607
00:27:03.375 --> 00:27:05.416
And I said. "Yes.
it's going to be you.

608
00:27:05.416 --> 00:27:06.708
"We're gonna digitize you."

609
00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:07.875
He goes. "Really?"

610
00:27:07.875 --> 00:27:09.208
"We're gonna videotape you.

611
00:27:09.208 --> 00:27:10.500
"and it's gonna be
you in the game."

612
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:12.083
I think he was just
as excited about tha

613
00:27:12.083 --> 00:27:13.958
as he was about his
role in the movie.

614
00:27:15.583 --> 00:27:17.250
- [Character] Excellent.

615
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:19.541
- I think what's really fun
about the arcade experience

616
00:27:19.541 --> 00:27:22.416
with peripherals is
it kind of allows yo

617
00:27:22.416 --> 00:27:24.000
to have a gaming experience

618
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.125
that you might not be
able to get in your house.

619
00:27:26.125 --> 00:27:28.250
Having that thing that
you're holding in your hands

620
00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:30.250
makes it feel more
like a performance.

621
00:27:30.250 --> 00:27:31.916
[Ernest Cline] - That was
one of the most egregious

622
00:27:31.916 --> 00:27:33.208
quarter-sucking games. too.

623
00:27:33.208 --> 00:27:34.708
Like you would get killed
after three seconds

624
00:27:34.708 --> 00:27:36.375
and have to put it
in. but the graphics.

625
00:27:36.375 --> 00:27:38.750
again. it was like graphics
from the movie scanned in.

626
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:41.750
So you're actually playing
Arnold and fighting the T-1000

627
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.416
and there were elements
from the movie.

628
00:27:43.416 --> 00:27:45.083
So it really felt like
you were in the movies.

629
00:27:45.083 --> 00:27:47.291
- [Character] Hasta
la vista. baby.

630
00:27:48.958 --> 00:27:50.750
- But by the time
you reached the end

631
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:53.708
and defeated the T-1000.
you had spent more

632
00:27:53.708 --> 00:27:56.125
than it would cost to
watch the movie 10 times.

633
00:27:56.125 --> 00:27:57.750
- See. when a game
went on test. we all.

634
00:27:57.750 --> 00:28:00.208
we all went out and kind of.

635
00:28:00.208 --> 00:28:03.125
we'd go watch it and have
dinner and come watch it.

636
00:28:03.125 --> 00:28:04.958
And the game was
killing people in like.

637
00:28:04.958 --> 00:28:07.583
I mean people were literally
lasting like 18 seconds.

638
00:28:07.583 --> 00:28:09.875
I remember John Tobias one time.

639
00:28:09.875 --> 00:28:12.250
he's like standing next to
it and we're watching it.

640
00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:15.333
and these guys just got wasted.

641
00:28:15.333 --> 00:28:17.583
And he just turns around. he
goes. "That was 18 seconds!

642
00:28:17.583 --> 00:28:19.250
"They died in 18 seconds!"

643
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.875
And it was like. you
know. he's yelling.

644
00:28:20.875 --> 00:28:22.000
I'm like. "Don't tell them
they just lost their money."

645
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.958
It was so funny.

646
00:28:23.958 --> 00:28:27.208
- T2 was a good
success for Midway.

647
00:28:27.208 --> 00:28:32.916
It opened the door for a
more cinematic experience.

648
00:28:33.125 --> 00:28:35.125
- It got Midway to a new level.

649
00:28:35.125 --> 00:28:36.958
It just all of a sudden was
like. this is what it means

650
00:28:36.958 --> 00:28:39.291
to sell a crap ton of games.

651
00:28:39.291 --> 00:28:41.375
And this is what it means
to earn $1.000 a week.

652
00:28:41.375 --> 00:28:43.125
And just. you know. I
mean. it was just nonstop.

653
00:28:44.125 --> 00:28:46.208
- [Character] It's Judgment Day.

654
00:28:46.208 --> 00:28:51.208
- So we released T2. and
it did. it was doing great.

655
00:28:51.208 --> 00:28:52.583
And I think this was
around the holidays

656
00:28:52.583 --> 00:28:53.791
Matter of fact. I
know it was around.

657
00:28:53.791 --> 00:28:56.708
It was New Years Eve.

658
00:28:56.708 --> 00:28:59.625
And our marketing person
called me at home and said.

659
00:28:59.625 --> 00:29:01.500
"Jack. are you available
on New Years Da

660
00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:04.791
"to come downtown to the studio

661
00:29:04.791 --> 00:29:09.125
"and be interviewed by
Entertainment Tonight?"

662
00:29:09.125 --> 00:29:12.125
So I went down the next day.
and there was a reporter there.

663
00:29:12.125 --> 00:29:14.708
and the game was
there. and she was asking

664
00:29:14.708 --> 00:29:16.333
lots of questions
about the development.

665
00:29:16.333 --> 00:29:18.583
Like. "How did you get
Arnold into the game?"

666
00:29:18.583 --> 00:29:20.625
and "Wow. that really
looks like Robert Patrick."

667
00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:21.875
those sort of questions.

668
00:29:21.875 --> 00:29:24.208
And right in the middle
of it was a question

669
00:29:24.208 --> 00:29:26.375
that was framed very different
than any other question

670
00:29:26.375 --> 00:29:28.000
she had been asking me.

671
00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.500
"So in the game. you are
shooting police officers.

672
00:29:33.583 --> 00:29:36.583
"How do you feel about that?"

673
00:29:36.583 --> 00:29:37.875
- It's very clear in the movie

674
00:29:37.875 --> 00:29:40.000
that Arnold never kills anybody.

675
00:29:40.291 --> 00:29:41.375
He shoots them in the knee.

676
00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.208
And they fall over and
they're no longer a threat.

677
00:29:47.208 --> 00:29:49.750
And that's exactly what
happens in the game.

678
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:52.375
[characters crying out]
[shooting]

679
00:29:52.375 --> 00:29:55.333
- And I told her to stop
right then. and I said.

680
00:29:56.791 --> 00:30:01.375
"You need to convey my
answer in its entirety."

681
00:30:02.875 --> 00:30:05.583
because I felt very
personal about this.

682
00:30:05.583 --> 00:30:09.750
And I said I had family members
who were in the police force

683
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:12.916
so I took it very seriously.

684
00:30:12.916 --> 00:30:17.125
And what it ended up being was
kind of this real accusatory.

685
00:30:17.125 --> 00:30:20.041
hard-hitting like.
"So how do you feel

686
00:30:20.041 --> 00:30:22.583
"about making a video game
that encourages people

687
00:30:22.583 --> 00:30:24.000
"to shoot cops?"

688
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.125
- And it was. it was
our first experience in

689
00:30:30.125 --> 00:30:34.083
how video games were
directly impacting

690
00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.291
the entertainment community.

691
00:30:37.291 --> 00:30:41.166
and through the media.
society as a whole

692
00:30:43.416 --> 00:30:46.000
- You know. in some ways.
I think the old saying is

693
00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.666
bad publicity is
never really bad.

694
00:30:48.666 --> 00:30:50.208
It's publicity.

695
00:30:50.208 --> 00:30:52.791
And it gives you some
notoriety and some attention.

696
00:30:52.791 --> 00:30:55.833
And maybe people that
might not have been aware

697
00:30:55.833 --> 00:30:57.833
of the game before have
now become aware of it

698
00:30:57.833 --> 00:30:59.416
because of this free publicity.

699
00:30:59.416 --> 00:31:02.625
So it worked to our
advantage. ultimately

700
00:31:07.250 --> 00:31:10.375
- By the early '90s. I mean.
we were on a roll at Midway.

701
00:31:10.375 --> 00:31:12.333
and the whole NARC technology.

702
00:31:12.333 --> 00:31:17.083
our photorealistic digitization
was just killing the world.

703
00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:22.291
But as studio head. I really
didn't have the cycles

704
00:31:22.291 --> 00:31:24.625
to like do something new.

705
00:31:24.625 --> 00:31:27.791
A dream of mine was what's the
next phase of the industry.

706
00:31:27.791 --> 00:31:29.708
and it's 3D texture mapping.

707
00:31:29.708 --> 00:31:31.541
I could see that that
was going to happen

708
00:31:33.041 --> 00:31:34.750
And I really wanted
to do a driving game

709
00:31:35.958 --> 00:31:37.916
- Go in to work Monday morning.

710
00:31:37.916 --> 00:31:42.000
and the person that had
to office next to me

711
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.666
I noticed was empty.

712
00:31:43.666 --> 00:31:46.416
And I was like. well.
what's going on?

713
00:31:46.416 --> 00:31:48.291
And I noticed a couple
of cubicles were empty.

714
00:31:48.291 --> 00:31:52.291
I called Ken. I'm like. "Did
I miss something?" [laughs]

715
00:31:52.291 --> 00:31:54.291
"Did I miss something
that was going on?

716
00:31:54.291 --> 00:31:55.958
"I don't understand."

717
00:31:55.958 --> 00:31:59.833
And he said. "Oh
yeah. Eugene and Mark.

718
00:31:59.833 --> 00:32:01.500
"they had a project
they wanted to work on.

719
00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.000
"But they're gonna work
on it out of house."

720
00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.125
And out of house
meant they had quit

721
00:32:06.125 --> 00:32:07.666
and they started
their own company.

722
00:32:07.666 --> 00:32:10.416
And it was like. uh.

723
00:32:10.416 --> 00:32:12.708
- You know. they had
tremendous talent.

724
00:32:12.708 --> 00:32:17.083
And you know. it was
Turmell. Petro. Jack Haeger.

725
00:32:17.083 --> 00:32:19.875
The art side had John Tobias.

726
00:32:19.875 --> 00:32:21.208
- The first time I heard that.

727
00:32:21.208 --> 00:32:23.791
I remember feeling
lost a little bit.

728
00:32:23.791 --> 00:32:25.958
It's almost like your
parent is leaving the house

729
00:32:25.958 --> 00:32:27.208
kind of a thing.

730
00:32:27.208 --> 00:32:29.083
- You know. in true
Williams style.

731
00:32:29.083 --> 00:32:31.208
nobody decided to say anything.

732
00:32:31.208 --> 00:32:35.750
They never sort of like
dealt with the fact

733
00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:39.000
that the manager of the
video department was gone.

734
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.250
They just kind of
left us. you know.

735
00:32:41.250 --> 00:32:43.541
Lord of the Flies style.

736
00:32:43.541 --> 00:32:45.208
- I always looked at him as
being kind of the Godfather

737
00:32:45.208 --> 00:32:47.958
of the industry and sort
of a leader of. you know.

738
00:32:47.958 --> 00:32:49.291
of our studio.

739
00:32:49.291 --> 00:32:51.125
And so when he was walking away.

740
00:32:51.125 --> 00:32:54.541
that was not a good feeling.

741
00:32:54.541 --> 00:32:57.166
Here we've got the Godfather.
the Doctor of Video Games.

742
00:32:57.166 --> 00:32:59.666
Eugene Jarvis. creator of all.

743
00:32:59.666 --> 00:33:01.000
Some call him God.

744
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.625
What do you call yourself?

745
00:33:02.625 --> 00:33:04.500
- Ah. [beep] face.

746
00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:06.333
[laughing]

747
00:33:06.333 --> 00:33:07.666
- [Woman] That's a wrap.

748
00:33:07.666 --> 00:33:09.125
- That's good. that's
a wrap. let's end it.

749
00:33:10.250 --> 00:33:12.416
- In the early '80s.
the games were metaphor.

750
00:33:12.416 --> 00:33:16.375
So it wasn't real space men.

751
00:33:16.375 --> 00:33:19.000
It was little
metaphorical bleeps.

752
00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.208
and you know. little
animated sprites

753
00:33:21.208 --> 00:33:25.250
that represented a human
or an alien or a spaceship.

754
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.916
The more you got into
realism. definitely

755
00:33:27.916 --> 00:33:35.750
I think brought in more of the
male aggressive game player.

756
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:37.041
- The games were louder.

757
00:33:37.041 --> 00:33:38.416
The graphics are more detailed.

758
00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:39.625
There's lots more blood.

759
00:33:39.625 --> 00:33:41.750
Like it feels different.

760
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:43.916
And that's something
that the companies

761
00:33:43.916 --> 00:33:45.708
were really actively
advertising.

762
00:33:45.708 --> 00:33:47.041
Games have always been violent.

763
00:33:47.041 --> 00:33:48.625
so I'm not saying that
comes out of nowhere.

764
00:33:48.625 --> 00:33:50.208
But it's not the thing

765
00:33:50.208 --> 00:33:52.333
that they were kind of
leading with before. right?

766
00:33:54.250 --> 00:33:55.708
[Neil Nicastro] - I think
everybody by this point

767
00:33:55.708 --> 00:33:57.291
knows the story about
Mortal Kombat.

768
00:33:57.291 --> 00:33:59.416
It wasn't Mortal Kombat
to start out with

769
00:33:59.416 --> 00:34:03.708
And this is probably the
greatest story of Midway

770
00:34:03.958 --> 00:34:05.875
Ed Boon and John Tobias.

771
00:34:05.875 --> 00:34:09.041
[John Tobias]- I think the
first time I met him was...

772
00:34:09.041 --> 00:34:11.958
he was playing his radio
really loud in his office.

773
00:34:11.958 --> 00:34:13.875
He kept coming next door to us.

774
00:34:13.875 --> 00:34:15.416
you know. knocking on
our door and coming in.

775
00:34:15.416 --> 00:34:17.625
sticking his head in and going.

776
00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:18.541
"Hey. is that too loud?

777
00:34:18.541 --> 00:34:20.416
"Sounds too loud."

778
00:34:20.416 --> 00:34:21.666
And he'd go back and lower
his volume a little bit

779
00:34:21.666 --> 00:34:22.708
and he'd come back.

780
00:34:22.708 --> 00:34:24.291
"Hey. is that too loud?"

781
00:34:24.291 --> 00:34:27.250
And you know. so that was the
first time that I met him.

782
00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:29.916
I think my first reaction
was. who the fuck is this guy?

783
00:34:29.916 --> 00:34:32.708
[Neil Nicastro] - We had about
a three-month gap

784
00:34:32.708 --> 00:34:35.375
in the factory's
production line.

785
00:34:35.375 --> 00:34:37.583
And they said. "We
can give you a game."

786
00:34:37.583 --> 00:34:39.708
It was like some
ridiculous break time.

787
00:34:39.708 --> 00:34:41.166
It was like six months.

788
00:34:41.166 --> 00:34:44.000
"A new game in six
months to fill the gap."

789
00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.083
"All right. what is it?"

790
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:46.583
"It's a fighting game."

791
00:34:46.583 --> 00:34:49.416
[John Tobias] - Karate Champ was
a fighting game that I had

792
00:34:49.416 --> 00:34:51.250
played in high school.
and I loved that game.

793
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.250
And I thought. wow.
that would lend itself

794
00:34:53.250 --> 00:34:56.125
to sort of this one-on-one
fighting game idea.

795
00:34:56.125 --> 00:34:58.958
I was a huge martial arts fan.

796
00:34:58.958 --> 00:35:01.250
I loved old Kung Fu movies.

797
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:03.125
In the early '90s.

798
00:35:03.125 --> 00:35:05.583
there were two up-and-coming
martial arts stars.

799
00:35:05.583 --> 00:35:08.750
There was Van Damme. and
then there was Steven Seagal.

800
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:12.125
We thought. wow. we have to
get one of those guys involved.

801
00:35:13.958 --> 00:35:15.458
- Not bad kid.

802
00:35:15.458 --> 00:35:18.958
- And we're gonna use
Jean-Claude Van Damme's image

803
00:35:18.958 --> 00:35:22.333
in this game like we. you know.

804
00:35:22.333 --> 00:35:25.000
now have begun doing in
our other video games.

805
00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.500
Okay.

806
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.916
- We wanted him to come
in to do some videos

807
00:35:28.916 --> 00:35:31.416
you know. to digitize
him. and things like that

808
00:35:31.416 --> 00:35:32.708
the voiceover. whatever.

809
00:35:32.708 --> 00:35:35.541
What I remember is
he just wasn't cooperative

810
00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:37.208
- This was a filler game for us.

811
00:35:37.208 --> 00:35:39.125
you know. just something
to fill the gap

812
00:35:39.125 --> 00:35:42.625
And excuse my language.
okay. but I said

813
00:35:42.625 --> 00:35:44.791
"Kenny. tell him to go fuck off.

814
00:35:44.791 --> 00:35:48.000
"Tell these guys. make
up their own characters

815
00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.208
"and put their own
characters in the gam

816
00:35:50.208 --> 00:35:52.333
"Make a fighting game
with their own characters.

817
00:35:52.333 --> 00:35:54.250
"Forget about
Jean-Claude Van Damme."

818
00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:55.875
- Actually. I thought
that was great.

819
00:35:55.875 --> 00:36:00.333
Like. I thought the freedom to
sort of create our own story

820
00:36:00.333 --> 00:36:04.250
and our own characters and all
those things was appealing.

821
00:36:04.250 --> 00:36:06.000
The first character we
taped on Mortal Kombat

822
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.750
was Johnny Cage.

823
00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:10.208
- I remember first showing up
to the first day

824
00:36:10.208 --> 00:36:12.791
of shooting Mortal Kombat.
showing up to film

825
00:36:12.791 --> 00:36:16.333
and literally having to spend
an hour with John and Ed

826
00:36:16.333 --> 00:36:18.375
cleaning up an area
for us to film.

827
00:36:18.375 --> 00:36:21.250
because there was no room
for us to film anything.

828
00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:24.250
[John Tobias] - When we taped the
Johnny Cage character.

829
00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:26.333
I think we might have
worked on the game

830
00:36:26.333 --> 00:36:30.208
for at least a month before
we taped the second character.

831
00:36:30.208 --> 00:36:33.750
I think the idea was we wanted
to kinda take our learnings

832
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:36.791
on Johnny Cage and figure
out really what it was

833
00:36:36.791 --> 00:36:38.458
that we were messing with.

834
00:36:38.458 --> 00:36:41.791
If a character threw a kick.
you know. they would always.

835
00:36:41.791 --> 00:36:44.208
they'd wanna throw it
as fast as they could.

836
00:36:44.208 --> 00:36:47.500
And so the problem for us
was it would become a blur.

837
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.875
- John is like. "Bup
can't you float?

838
00:36:49.875 --> 00:36:50.791
"Try to float.

839
00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:52.083
"Hold yourself in the air.

840
00:36:52.083 --> 00:36:53.500
"because it's gonna
come out blurry."

841
00:36:54.666 --> 00:36:56.333
I was like. Bup. really?

842
00:36:59.250 --> 00:37:00.666
- And that was a
learning process.

843
00:37:00.666 --> 00:37:02.666
We didn't walk in
with all the answers.

844
00:37:02.666 --> 00:37:06.958
It was just sort of. we would
tape a character doing moves

845
00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:09.208
and then we'd go back and
work with the actual artwork.

846
00:37:09.208 --> 00:37:11.958
Ed would start to work with
the graphics and the game.

847
00:37:14.750 --> 00:37:16.625
He would kinda come back
with the reality of.

848
00:37:16.625 --> 00:37:19.791
well. we have to do that in

We'd go look at the games.

there's these type of ninja.

- The Chinese Ninja Connection
was the name of the book.

875
00:38:51.375 --> 00:38:53.625
It was written as this
historical book about

876

some order of Chinese
assassins who had

877
00:38:59.375 --> 00:39:01.958
sort of predated
the Japanese ninja.

- So actually. he
bought that book.

879
00:39:03.625 --> 00:39:07.416
and Scorpion and Sub-Zero are
originally from that clan.

880

like. the name was made up.

The whole story was
gonna be bullshit.

and then there's
classic Sub-Zero.

They can run all that stuff down

899
00:39:44.583 --> 00:39:48.791
really. the core of the
product was its playability.

900
00:39:48.791 --> 00:39:51.541
And that started with Ed.

901
00:39:51.541 --> 00:39:54.291
That always came from him
sort of playing the game.

902
00:39:54.291 --> 00:39:56.125
And he would sit in
his office for hours

903

and call people in to kind of.

- His games reflect
his personality.

906
00:40:03.208 --> 00:40:06.416
I think his games bring
out the way Ed really feels

907
00:40:06.416 --> 00:40:09.500
about things. because
his nature is outrageous.

908
00:40:09.750 --> 00:40:12.000
- There was a period
at the end of a match

where you kind of got a free
hit off of your opponent.

And we wanted to kind of
put an exclamation on it.

would ever discover.

discovered it right away.

weekend. they discovered it.

what that even meant.

look at it and was like.

F-U to everybody.

Well. how about we
turn it up to 11

966

and just make that even worse
than anything you could imagine?

just laughing heartily.

She's athletic. kickass.

00:44:54.416 --> 00:44:57.750
Oh. he's making one of
the greatest arcade games

1020
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:58.541
of all time.

1021
00:45:02.500 --> 00:45:04.875
[Mark Turmell] - The rules of
basketball are so perfect

1022
00:45:04.875 --> 00:45:07.000
You've got a three-point line.

1023
00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.208
You've got timers
for the shot clock.

1024
00:45:09.208 --> 00:45:13.291
You've got periods that
we can tighten up to be

1025
00:45:13.291 --> 00:45:14.750
the right timeframe.

1026
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:17.750
So just the inherent
rules of basketball

1027
00:45:17.750 --> 00:45:22.166
made for really a
great product strategy

1028
00:45:25.166 --> 00:45:27.333
- People have asked me
about the influence of

1029
00:45:27.333 --> 00:45:30.333
Arch Rivals on
NBA Jam. obviously.

1030
00:45:30.333 --> 00:45:32.666
'cause a lot of the same
game-playing mechanic.

1031
00:45:32.666 --> 00:45:34.250
We were first.

1032
00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:36.708
But all I really know
is that I've been told

1033
00:45:36.708 --> 00:45:39.875
that Mark Turmell was a fan.

1034
00:45:39.875 --> 00:45:41.708
- You know. I think maybe
I've played that game

1035
00:45:41.708 --> 00:45:44.208
three or four games
total in my life.

1036
00:45:44.208 --> 00:45:48.375
It's just not a game
that appealed to me with.

1037
00:45:48.375 --> 00:45:49.625
you know. you kinda
pull the pants down.

1038
00:45:49.625 --> 00:45:51.208
They had a punch.

1039
00:45:51.208 --> 00:45:53.791
- He asked us about our interest
in doing licensed products.

1040
00:45:53.791 --> 00:45:55.958
officially licensed products.

1041
00:45:55.958 --> 00:45:59.083
And we were resistant.

1042
00:45:59.083 --> 00:46:01.875
mainly because on my side was.

1043
00:46:01.875 --> 00:46:03.916
I didn't want to do
photographic stuff.

1044
00:46:03.916 --> 00:46:05.958
I wanted to keep doing cartoons.

1045
00:46:05.958 --> 00:46:08.291
I felt that's where
the humor was gonna be.

1046
00:46:08.291 --> 00:46:10.250
- Neil Nicastro came
into my office one day.

1047
00:46:10.250 --> 00:46:13.541
and he said. "How
come you're not pursuing

1048
00:46:13.541 --> 00:46:14.791
"the NBA license?

1049
00:46:14.791 --> 00:46:17.250
- If they're the real
basketball players

1050
00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:19.791
that's what the players
are going to want to be.

1051
00:46:19.791 --> 00:46:21.125
They're going to want to.

1052
00:46:21.125 --> 00:46:23.125
they have their
favorite basketball stars

1053
00:46:23.125 --> 00:46:25.625
They want to play as
those basketball stars.

1054
00:46:25.625 --> 00:46:26.791
That what we have to do.

1055
00:46:27.791 --> 00:46:28.666
- Made the pitch.

1056
00:46:30.541 --> 00:46:31.833
- [Announcer] Williams
Electronics is
currently developing

1057
00:46:31.833 --> 00:46:35.125
an arcade-based. four-player
video basketball game.

1058
00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:38.541
one which employs lifelike
digitized graphics.

1059
00:46:38.541 --> 00:46:41.000
First. basketball players
are videotaped in the studio

1060
00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.375
performing hundreds of moves.

1061
00:46:43.375 --> 00:46:46.791
Artists digitize this footage
into individual frames.

1062
00:46:46.791 --> 00:46:49.625
which are stored and
played back in sequence.

1063
00:46:49.625 --> 00:46:52.625
or animated to create a
video basketball player

1064
00:46:52.625 --> 00:46:55.583
capable of performing
on command.

1065
00:46:55.583 --> 00:46:58.333
Well. the NBA's
immediate reaction was.

1066
00:46:58.333 --> 00:47:00.625
hey. thanks. but no thanks.

1067
00:47:00.625 --> 00:47:03.208
Their kind of understanding
or perception

1068
00:47:03.208 --> 00:47:06.416
of the arcade business
was rooted there

1069
00:47:06.416 --> 00:47:10.625
in Times Square. which was a
very seedy area at the time.

1070
00:47:10.625 --> 00:47:15.375
And they did not want
the NBA logo presented

1071
00:47:15.375 --> 00:47:16.791
in that atmosphere.

1072
00:47:16.791 --> 00:47:19.750
- I remember a
comment internally

1073
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:22.375
"Don't they realize how much
money they're gonna make?"

1074
00:47:22.375 --> 00:47:24.250
Seriously. I mean. we're not
even gonna cover the salary

1075
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:25.916
of one player. let's face it.

1076
00:47:25.916 --> 00:47:29.333
The NBA will continue whether
they do a game with us or not.

1077
00:47:30.083 --> 00:47:31.666
- So our video guy.
once again. he said.

1078
00:47:31.666 --> 00:47:33.250
"I can solve this."

1079
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:35.541
He went out to family
entertainment centers

1080
00:47:35.541 --> 00:47:38.916
around Chicago and
he took videos to sho

1081
00:47:38.916 --> 00:47:40.375
what a real arcade is like.

1082
00:47:40.375 --> 00:47:42.708
We sent that back to the NBA

1083
00:47:42.708 --> 00:47:46.750
to tell them this is what
it's like. not Times Square.

1084
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:48.541
They accepted that.
they understood.

1085
00:47:48.541 --> 00:47:52.208
and they started talking
deal terms with Roger Sharpe.

1086
00:47:52.208 --> 00:47:54.250
- Understand and appreciate
that there's never been

1087
00:47:54.250 --> 00:47:57.250
a professional sports
team licensed in coin-op.

1088
00:47:57.250 --> 00:48:00.291
- Well. the logistics of
getting all the players

1089
00:48:01.291 --> 00:48:05.250
in our studio. and then the
logistics of having them do

1090
00:48:05.250 --> 00:48:07.916
every animation over
and over and over again.

1091
00:48:07.916 --> 00:48:09.333
because there was a
few hundred animations.

1092
00:48:09.333 --> 00:48:11.500
and the logistics of
then going through

1093
00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.333
and stripping out all
those. it couldn't be done.

1094
00:48:14.333 --> 00:48:16.333
Like there's just no way.

1095
00:48:16.333 --> 00:48:18.500
- [Man] Okay. all
right. that's good.

1096
00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:22.250
- We figured out
a system for using

1097
00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:25.333
an attachment system
that games typically used

1098
00:48:25.333 --> 00:48:28.000
for putting like different
types of guns or weapons

1099
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.125
or props in characters' hands.

1100
00:48:30.125 --> 00:48:32.541
[Mark Turmell] - And so Shawn
Liptak trimmed off a head

1101
00:48:32.541 --> 00:48:36.208
and he pasted that
head on to prove

1102
00:48:36.208 --> 00:48:39.125
that we could kind of change
up a different flesh tone.

1103
00:48:39.125 --> 00:48:40.708
a different look.

1104
00:48:40.708 --> 00:48:43.208
- There were 16 different head
angles that we had to use.

1105
00:48:43.208 --> 00:48:45.375
one looking forward. one
looking up. one looking down.

1106
00:48:45.375 --> 00:48:46.958
one looking left.
one looking right.

1107
00:48:46.958 --> 00:48:49.083
one looking left up. one
looking left down [mumbles].

1108
00:48:50.666 --> 00:48:52.250
all the way around.

1109
00:48:52.250 --> 00:48:54.375
- And again. this is
before the internet

1110
00:48:54.375 --> 00:48:59.125
This is before. you know. any
easily accessible resource.

1111
00:48:59.958 --> 00:49:01.750
So we were looking at VHS tapes

1112
00:49:01.750 --> 00:49:03.916
of the biggest
dunks of all time.

1113
00:49:03.916 --> 00:49:07.958
looking at the athletes
and trying to trim out

1114
00:49:07.958 --> 00:49:12.375
their faces at these
different angles.

1115
00:49:12.375 --> 00:49:14.583
- We thought. hey. why
don't we put our heads in.

1116
00:49:14.583 --> 00:49:17.375
Like let's be in
the game ourselves.

1117
00:49:17.375 --> 00:49:18.708
How cool would that be?

1118
00:49:18.708 --> 00:49:21.000
That's worth doing the
game right there for.

1119
00:49:22.875 --> 00:49:25.250
We got. you know.
everybody from around

1120
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:26.541
who wanted to be in there.

1121
00:49:26.541 --> 00:49:27.875
And we'd get them
into the studio.

1122
00:49:27.875 --> 00:49:29.166
and we'd shoot all our angles.

1123
00:49:29.166 --> 00:49:30.583
And then there was one
guy that we worked with.

1124
00:49:30.583 --> 00:49:35.250
Sheridan Oursler. who came in
with a derby hat on his head.

1125
00:49:36.958 --> 00:49:39.250
And we're like. "Hey Sheridan.
you want us to shoot you

1126
00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:40.916
"with that hat on your head?

1127
00:49:40.916 --> 00:49:42.958
He was like. "Yeah.
yeah. this is my derby."

1128
00:49:43.958 --> 00:49:45.250
And so we go. "Okay."

1129
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:47.750
And so we shot him with
a derby on his head

1130
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:48.958
and put him in the game

1131
00:49:48.958 --> 00:49:50.291
and like didn't
think anything of it.

1132
00:49:50.291 --> 00:49:52.291
And then I think we
put the game on test

1133
00:49:52.291 --> 00:49:55.375
And people freaked out
because it was a person

1134
00:49:55.375 --> 00:49:56.708
with a derby.

1135
00:49:56.708 --> 00:49:57.916
You've never seen a
person with a derby

1136
00:49:57.916 --> 00:49:59.958
playing a basketball
game before.

1137
00:49:59.958 --> 00:50:02.416
So like within a
few weeks. you know.

1138
00:50:02.416 --> 00:50:04.583
throughout the arcades
that we had it on test in.

1139
00:50:04.583 --> 00:50:07.291
everybody's playing Sheridan's
head with a derby hat.

1140
00:50:07.291 --> 00:50:09.375
- [Game] Go up.
delivers the special!

1141
00:50:10.791 --> 00:50:12.083
- Funny. because
we got NBA license.

1142
00:50:12.083 --> 00:50:13.708
but people liked playing
the special characters

1143
00:50:13.708 --> 00:50:14.958
more than they liked
playing the NBA players.

1144
00:50:14.958 --> 00:50:17.375
- Well. we were
doing things now.

1145
00:50:17.375 --> 00:50:20.375
like putting in the
Mortal Kombat characters.

1146
00:50:20.375 --> 00:50:22.958
[NBA Jam music]

1147
00:50:23.958 --> 00:50:26.250
- The NBA had a fit

1148
00:50:26.458 --> 00:50:28.000
when they saw there were
Mortal Kombat characters.

1149
00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.333
[characters yelling]

1150
00:50:31.333 --> 00:50:33.208
- And I thought. oh gamers
are gonna love that.

1151
00:50:33.208 --> 00:50:35.333
A little crossover.
thing. that's great.

1152
00:50:35.333 --> 00:50:37.708
And so Mark says that on
the record in an interview.

1153
00:50:37.708 --> 00:50:40.625
and I go and I type it up.

1154
00:50:40.625 --> 00:50:44.291
And a week-and-a-half later.
I get a phone call from Mark.

1155
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:46.416
which I'm not expecting.

1156
00:50:46.416 --> 00:50:49.041
And he goes. "Yeah. I
needed to follow up with you

1157
00:50:49.041 --> 00:50:52.125
"on something that came
up in our interview.

1158
00:50:53.583 --> 00:50:55.666
"Remember that thing
about the Mortal Kombat

1159
00:50:55.666 --> 00:50:57.375
"secret characters
in Tournament Edition

1160
00:50:57.375 --> 00:50:59.250
I'm like. "Yeah. I'm
looking forward to that."

1161
00:50:59.250 --> 00:51:02.708
He goes. "Yeah. we've been
on the phone with the NBA.

1162
00:51:02.708 --> 00:51:07.458
"and they're. they're not
really into the idea." [laughs]

1163
00:51:08.083 --> 00:51:09.791
- And it was not
a good situation.

1164
00:51:09.791 --> 00:51:11.333
And we had to scramble
very. very quickly

1165
00:51:11.333 --> 00:51:13.416
to produce a new set of
ROMs that did not have

1166
00:51:13.416 --> 00:51:16.583
the Mortal Kombat
characters in them.

1167
00:51:16.583 --> 00:51:19.083
- [Game] Get that outta here!

1168
00:51:19.083 --> 00:51:21.875
- That traditional
gaming audience

1169
00:51:21.875 --> 00:51:23.291
that wants to find secrets.

1170
00:51:23.291 --> 00:51:25.875
that needs to collect
every coin in the game.

1171
00:51:25.875 --> 00:51:28.375
that wants to know every
secret warp in every level.

1172
00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.208
that absolutely was catnip

1173
00:51:32.208 --> 00:51:34.250
to all of the hard-core
gamers that were like.

1174
00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:36.000
"Well. I know something
you don't know."

1175
00:51:36.791 --> 00:51:38.000
- [Game] No way!

1176
00:51:40.083 --> 00:51:41.541
Jackson [cheering
drowns out words]

1177
00:51:41.541 --> 00:51:44.291
- Having actual announcers.

1178
00:51:45.666 --> 00:51:48.625
I couldn't push them
into the high energy part

1179
00:51:48.625 --> 00:51:51.333
of being an announcer voice

1180
00:51:51.333 --> 00:51:53.791
for a quarter-at-a-time
video game

1181
00:51:53.791 --> 00:51:55.083
in an arcade setting.

1182
00:51:55.083 --> 00:51:57.125
- I had never done
any voiceover before.

1183
00:51:57.125 --> 00:51:59.375
I had never done any
sports work before.

1184
00:51:59.375 --> 00:52:01.166
related to acting or voiceover.

1185
00:52:01.166 --> 00:52:03.125
It was just acting
work. stage work.

1186
00:52:03.125 --> 00:52:04.875
and work at Second City.

1187
00:52:04.875 --> 00:52:06.291
- So I got Tim in.

1188
00:52:06.291 --> 00:52:10.333
And he was kinda doing
his Marv Alpert

1189
00:52:10.333 --> 00:52:12.333
but really. he
just became himself

1190
00:52:12.333 --> 00:52:14.125
and became that actor.

1191
00:52:14.125 --> 00:52:15.041
- It was like this.

1192
00:52:15.041 --> 00:52:17.000
John came in. gave me a script.

1193
00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.375
He said. "Big." he said. "Loud."

1194
00:52:19.375 --> 00:52:23.291
and I went. "He's on fire.
rejected. boom shakalaka!

1195
00:52:23.291 --> 00:52:24.500
"He's heating up!"

1196
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:27.333
And that was about it. [laughs]

1197
00:52:27.333 --> 00:52:29.250
- And think about
making that system work

1198
00:52:29.250 --> 00:52:33.208
We're talking about a
system that is calling

1199
00:52:33.208 --> 00:52:37.708
the play-by-play action.
splicing in player names.

1200
00:52:37.708 --> 00:52:39.583
at different levels
of inflection.

1201
00:52:39.583 --> 00:52:41.750
- The reason for the
different inflections is

1202
00:52:41.750 --> 00:52:45.250
just for that variety
of before a shot.

1203
00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:47.541
after a shot. in the
middle of a shot.

1204
00:52:47.541 --> 00:52:49.750
Pippen for three!

1205
00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:51.375
Pippen with the dunk!

1206
00:52:51.375 --> 00:52:54.041
Pippen with the monster jam!

1207
00:52:54.041 --> 00:52:57.833
Pippen. Pippen. Stockton.
Stockton. Stockton!

1208
00:52:57.833 --> 00:53:00.125
- [Game] Rebound.
Jams it in!

1209
00:53:01.583 --> 00:53:04.250
- And there used to be a game
called Run and Gun by Konami

1210
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:06.250
that was the first game that
actually the camera work

1211
00:53:06.250 --> 00:53:08.125
seemed to like follow
you down the court

1212
00:53:08.125 --> 00:53:09.583
I go down. I listened
to that game.

1213
00:53:09.583 --> 00:53:12.791
and I hear the guy
go. "Nice shot."

1214
00:53:12.791 --> 00:53:17.000
- [Game] Fakes him up. put
it up. three. yes. good shot.

1215
00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.250
Way to go.

1216
00:53:18.250 --> 00:53:19.250
- What is this guy?

1217
00:53:19.250 --> 00:53:20.958
Is he medicated or something?

1218
00:53:20.958 --> 00:53:23.416
That's not how you
call a basketball gam

1219
00:53:23.416 --> 00:53:25.250
I go down to the
other end and hear.

1220
00:53:25.250 --> 00:53:27.125
"Get that stuff outta
here. rejected!"

1221
00:53:27.125 --> 00:53:28.875
And I could feel the
effect that my voice had

1222
00:53:28.875 --> 00:53:31.250
on that extra amping
up of the situation

1223
00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:33.333
So sometimes I'd
sneak up behind him.

1224
00:53:33.333 --> 00:53:35.291
guy would take a shot.
and I'd go. "Ugly shot!

1225
00:53:35.291 --> 00:53:36.208
"Puts up a brick!"

1226
00:53:36.208 --> 00:53:37.958
or "Get that stuff outta here!"

1227
00:53:37.958 --> 00:53:39.083
He'd turn around and go.
"Hey. you sound like the guy!"

1228
00:53:39.083 --> 00:53:41.125
And I'd go. "I am
the guy. dude."

1229
00:53:44.125 --> 00:53:46.500
- Eugene Jarvis always
told me. you know

1230
00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:48.125
make sure the player
gets more powerful.

1231
00:53:48.125 --> 00:53:50.208
Never take something
away from him.

1232
00:53:50.208 --> 00:53:52.750
But what if we. you know.
put the player into a mode

1233
00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:54.791
where he's on fire and
everything's a swish?

1234
00:53:54.791 --> 00:53:58.541
And we knew right away that
there was a mechanic there

1235
00:53:58.541 --> 00:53:59.833
that made sense.

1236
00:53:59.833 --> 00:54:02.500
- And I was saying.
"Oh. that's unrealistic.

1237
00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:05.500
"That's not cool. it's
gonna be fantasy then.

1238
00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.291
"People aren't gonna take
it seriously." or whatever.

1239
00:54:07.291 --> 00:54:08.541
And they're like. "No.
no. it's video game.

1240
00:54:08.541 --> 00:54:10.000
"It's totally video
game. it's totally cool.

1241
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.583
"It's totally cool!"

1242
00:54:11.583 --> 00:54:13.125
And I'm all like [muttering]
"It's not gonna be cool at all.

1243
00:54:13.125 --> 00:54:14.291
"Nobody's gonna like that."

1244
00:54:15.125 --> 00:54:17.125
- He said. I won't
give you the art.

1245
00:54:17.125 --> 00:54:19.291
I won't give you flame art.

1246
00:54:19.291 --> 00:54:22.041
So I actually went
back into SmashTV

1247
00:54:22.041 --> 00:54:26.791
and took the flame explosions.
attached them to the ball.

1248
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:31.250
and we started the Smoke
Mode and the On Fire.

1249
00:54:31.250 --> 00:54:34.791
- First time that we
had seen in the arcade.

1250
00:54:34.791 --> 00:54:37.250
and these kids who are
playing the game already

1251
00:54:37.250 --> 00:54:40.708
for a couple weeks had
seen. you know. On Fire.

1252
00:54:40.708 --> 00:54:43.250
and slamming and
shattering the backboard

1253
00:54:45.583 --> 00:54:47.500
and the guy just went. "Ah!"

1254
00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:50.625
Raised his arms up in
the air. "Oh. hell no!"

1255
00:54:50.625 --> 00:54:53.708
And ran around the
arcade. inside.

1256
00:54:53.708 --> 00:54:55.875
He ran around four times.

1257
00:54:55.875 --> 00:54:57.375
Everybody screamed.

1258
00:54:57.375 --> 00:54:58.791
Everybody was like. "Ah!"

1259
00:54:58.791 --> 00:55:00.666
They're holding their
heads like they just saw

1260
00:55:00.666 --> 00:55:02.583
the Second Coming.

1261
00:55:02.583 --> 00:55:04.416
And we were like looking at
each other. like oh my God.

1262
00:55:04.416 --> 00:55:07.375
It's just such an
iconic part of.

1263
00:55:07.375 --> 00:55:10.250
and just felt so good
to see people get

1264
00:55:10.250 --> 00:55:11.916
that excited about something.

1265
00:55:11.916 --> 00:55:13.333
We're like. yeah. I think
it's gonna be pretty cool.

1266
00:55:13.333 --> 00:55:15.958
- This is bad. man. this is bad!

1267
00:55:16.750 --> 00:55:19.333
[NBA Jam music]

1268
00:55:21.416 --> 00:55:23.041
- If you're playing
against the computer

1269
00:55:23.041 --> 00:55:25.916
it's never going to allow
you to get too far in front.

1270
00:55:25.916 --> 00:55:28.333
You'll start missing shots.

1271
00:55:28.333 --> 00:55:30.333
Or the computer will
start missing shots a lot.

1272
00:55:30.333 --> 00:55:32.375
if the score's too far in front.

1273
00:55:32.375 --> 00:55:34.291
So it doesn't allow the
scores to get too far apart.

1274
00:55:34.291 --> 00:55:35.625
and it keeps the excitement of.

1275
00:55:35.625 --> 00:55:37.250
oh. I can so overtake
you. the last minute.

1276
00:55:37.250 --> 00:55:39.125
the last throw. I can win!

1277
00:55:39.125 --> 00:55:40.750
- If you're in the
fourth quarter.

1278
00:55:40.750 --> 00:55:44.041
and you have. you know.
just a few seconds left

1279
00:55:44.041 --> 00:55:45.750
and have an opportunity
to tie the game.

1280
00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:47.291
to have it go into overtime.

1281
00:55:47.291 --> 00:55:50.541
and take a shot at the buzzer.

1282
00:55:50.541 --> 00:55:52.958
the chances are so much higher

1283
00:55:52.958 --> 00:55:54.541
from the half court line

1284
00:55:54.541 --> 00:55:57.416
than it would be
from laying it up

1285
00:55:57.416 --> 00:55:59.125
at any other point in the game.

1286
00:55:59.125 --> 00:56:01.166
- Rubberbanding is.

1287
00:56:01.166 --> 00:56:03.958
I don't know if that
was a Mark Turmell call.

1288
00:56:03.958 --> 00:56:05.083
or what the deal was.

1289
00:56:05.083 --> 00:56:07.250
but the rubberbanding in NBA Jam

1290
00:56:07.250 --> 00:56:09.250
and then later in NFL
Blitz. and Showtim

1291
00:56:09.250 --> 00:56:10.375
and all that sort of stuff.

1292
00:56:11.541 --> 00:56:14.375
it's almost evil.

1293
00:56:14.375 --> 00:56:16.375
But also. it makes for
really heightened moments

1294
00:56:16.375 --> 00:56:17.875
of like. oh man. we
went to overtime again!

1295
00:56:17.875 --> 00:56:19.166
What are the odds!

1296
00:56:19.166 --> 00:56:20.958
Turns out the odds
are pretty good.

1297
00:56:20.958 --> 00:56:24.125
- [Game] At the
buzzer. he scores!

1298
00:56:24.125 --> 00:56:28.166
- We were getting calls
about games that were broken.

1299
00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.250
I said. "What?"

1300
00:56:31.250 --> 00:56:32.875
Because that's
one of the things.

1301
00:56:32.875 --> 00:56:36.125
you put a game on test.
you know. it's gotta work.

1302
00:56:36.125 --> 00:56:38.500
And to have a game
that's not working.

1303
00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.583
it's like the
height of stupidity.

1304
00:56:40.583 --> 00:56:42.041
- The game was supposedly down.

1305
00:56:42.041 --> 00:56:42.791
We said. "What the
heck's going on here?

1306
00:56:42.791 --> 00:56:44.416
So we go out there.

1307
00:56:44.416 --> 00:56:45.791
and you couldn't put any
more quarters in the game.

1308
00:56:45.791 --> 00:56:48.416
- It had accumulated
so many quarters.

1309
00:56:48.416 --> 00:56:50.208
it had jammed the coin mech

1310
00:56:50.208 --> 00:56:52.708
and you couldn't put
any more quarters i

1311
00:56:52.708 --> 00:56:53.958
- [Announcer] Unheard
of collections.

1312
00:56:53.958 --> 00:56:55.708
At all of our test locations.

1313
00:56:55.708 --> 00:57:02.375
NBA Jam is collecting between
124 and 167 percent

1314
00:57:02.375 --> 00:57:05.583
of what Mortal Kombat did
during its first six weeks.

1315
00:57:05.583 --> 00:57:08.916
- Jurassic Park was the
biggest film at the time.

1316
00:57:08.916 --> 00:57:11.250
and it was breaking all
kinds of earning records.

1317
00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:14.083
It made $350 million.

1318
00:57:14.083 --> 00:57:16.375
And that was a milestone
that people said

1319
00:57:16.375 --> 00:57:20.291
we can't believe it.
it's incomprehensible.

1320
00:57:20.291 --> 00:57:22.916
And here comes NBA Jam.
and Mark said. I said.

1321
00:57:22.916 --> 00:57:25.750
"Can you tell me about how
popular this really is?"

1322
00:57:25.750 --> 00:57:27.000
"I can tell you this.

1323
00:57:28.458 --> 00:57:31.500
"NBA Jam made a
billion dollars."

1324
00:57:31.500 --> 00:57:33.250
And I said. "In quarters?"

1325
00:57:33.250 --> 00:57:37.541
- Anybody that just liked
games and liked sports

1326
00:57:37.541 --> 00:57:40.041
and walked around a mall
would hear and see that game.

1327
00:57:40.041 --> 00:57:41.541
because in malls.
they were like arcades

1328
00:57:41.541 --> 00:57:43.250
and there was always
groups of people around.

1329
00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:44.125
And you're like. what's that?

1330
00:57:44.416 --> 00:57:45.791
- And when people
were playing together.

1331
00:57:45.791 --> 00:57:47.250
they're probably more
likely to keep playing.

1332
00:57:47.250 --> 00:57:49.083
because you can't just
walk off from your friend

1333
00:57:49.083 --> 00:57:50.291
that you're playing with.

1334
00:57:50.291 --> 00:57:51.875
- Whereas some
games are abstract.

1335
00:57:51.875 --> 00:57:53.375
or some people just don't
want to blast aliens.

1336
00:57:53.375 --> 00:57:55.125
or they don't want
to fight other people

1337
00:57:55.125 --> 00:57:57.583
the idea of. it's
like basketball.

1338
00:57:57.583 --> 00:58:00.375
but without all of
those pesky rules.

1339
00:58:00.375 --> 00:58:03.958
That becomes a very
appealing thing to people

1340
00:58:03.958 --> 00:58:05.291
that would be into sports.

1341
00:58:05.291 --> 00:58:07.416
but wouldn't be caught
dead in an arcade

1342
00:58:07.416 --> 00:58:09.541
But here. this is
the perfect gateway.

1343

[game announcer yelling]

1344

John Tobias - The home versions
of the early Mortal Kombat games

1345
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:21.375
were released by Acclaim.

1346
00:58:21.708 --> 00:58:24.208
- Mortal Kombat!

1347
00:58:24.208 --> 00:58:26.291
- I remember seeing
TV ads for the games

1348
00:58:26.291 --> 00:58:30.333
that partly fueled
the kind of concern

1349
00:58:30.333 --> 00:58:32.500
that parents had
about Mortal Kombat.

1350
00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.333
because it always emphasized
gangs of like young kids

1351
00:58:35.333 --> 00:58:38.583
running around streets
yelling. "Mortal Kombat!"

- I think parents felt
there was a revolution

1354
00:58:42.875 --> 00:58:44.958
about to happen. because
that's how it was portrayed

1355
00:58:44.958 --> 00:58:46.875
in the marketing materials.

1356
00:58:46.875 --> 00:58:49.625
That somehow their kids were
involved in this weird thing.

1357
00:58:49.625 --> 00:58:50.958
and suddenly they turn around

1358
00:58:50.958 --> 00:58:53.291
and it'd be like a
1984 kind of situatio

1359
00:58:53.291 --> 00:58:55.416
where all of the parents
would be thrown into jail

1360
00:58:55.416 --> 00:58:56.500
and kids would run amuck.

1361
00:58:59.416 --> 00:59:01.791
- You know. the home
games. when they came out.

1362
00:59:01.791 --> 00:59:06.750
they were marketed. I think.
to a younger audience.

1363
00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:08.041
- You know. when we filmed it.

1364
00:59:08.041 --> 00:59:09.083
we didn't film it
for a home version.

1365
00:59:09.083 --> 00:59:10.333
We filmed it for arcade.

1366
00:59:10.333 --> 00:59:12.958
And who is. you
know. at the arcade?

1367
00:59:12.958 --> 00:59:15.000
Kids with their own money.

1368
00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.291
- Actually. when I think back

1369
00:59:16.291 --> 00:59:17.916
of all of the time
I spent in arcades.

1370
00:59:17.916 --> 00:59:19.375
I don't remember seeing too
many moms walking around.

1371
00:59:19.375 --> 00:59:21.791
- [Reporter] After a $10
million advertising campaign.

1372
00:59:21.791 --> 00:59:24.708
Mortal Kombat. debuting
in home video today.

1373
00:59:24.708 --> 00:59:28.750
is expected to sell two
million copies at $50 a pop.

1374
00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:30.708
a horrifying
possibility for parents

1375
00:59:30.708 --> 00:59:32.625
who can't believe the game
makers are fantasizing

1376
00:59:32.625 --> 00:59:35.041
about decapitation and murder.

1377
00:59:35.041 --> 00:59:40.041
- So now moms and dads
are looking at their kids

1378
00:59:40.041 --> 00:59:44.708
playing this game. and they
see heads being decapitated.

1379
00:59:44.708 --> 00:59:47.041
skulls being pulled
off of bodies.

1380
00:59:47.041 --> 00:59:48.250
- I don't know think
we'll have this at home.

1381
00:59:48.250 --> 00:59:49.833
- You don't think so?

1382
00:59:49.833 --> 00:59:51.166
- No. they're too violent.
- You look a little startled.

1383
00:59:51.166 --> 00:59:52.583
- Yeah. it's a little
too violent. I think.

1384
00:59:52.583 --> 00:59:53.791
- That's pretty bad.

1385
00:59:53.791 --> 00:59:55.583
That's just plain gross.

1386
00:59:55.583 --> 00:59:57.291
- I'm sure moms were walking
through the living room

1387
00:59:57.291 --> 00:59:58.958
and looking at the
game that their

1388
01:00:00.541 --> 01:00:04.125
kids were playing. and writing
a letter to their Congressman

1389
01:00:04.125 --> 01:00:06.541
like. "I bought
Mortal Kombat thinking

1390
01:00:06.541 --> 01:00:08.000
"it was a fun fighting game."

1391
01:00:09.541 --> 01:00:11.666
- It's crazy to me how some
people don't see the humor

1392
01:00:11.666 --> 01:00:13.208
in Mortal Kombat.

1393
01:00:13.208 --> 01:00:15.291
I mean. one of the
taglines is Toasty!

1394
01:00:15.291 --> 01:00:16.875
What game does that?

1395
01:00:16.875 --> 01:00:20.625
I think that humor was
essential to its success.

1396
01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:23.333
because without it. I think
it just would have been

1397
01:00:23.333 --> 01:00:26.000
almost violent for the
sake of being violent.

1398
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.250
- Seeing Mortal Kombat
held up as a scapegoat

1399
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:31.708
for societal ills
was a direct parallel

1400
01:00:31.708 --> 01:00:33.250
to what rock-and-roll
had gone through

1401
01:00:33.250 --> 01:00:35.000
through the '50s
through the '70s.

1402
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.500
what comic books had
done in the '50s.

1403
01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.125
It was the latest thing
for the previous generation

1404
01:00:40.125 --> 01:00:43.541
to blame society's
problems on and say.

1405
01:00:43.541 --> 01:00:45.750
"These kids today. they're
gonna ruin the world."

1406
01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:47.166
- [Reporter] Children
of different ages.

1407
01:00:47.166 --> 01:00:48.625
And that is exactly what--

1408
01:00:48.625 --> 01:00:53.083
- Many companies would
shudder when they see

1409
01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:57.000
their product talked about
in an unfavorable light

1410
01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.541
by a US senator.

1411
01:00:58.541 --> 01:01:02.041
- The game narrator instructs
the player to finish.

1412
01:01:02.041 --> 01:01:03.708
and I quote. "finish
his opponent."

1413
01:01:03.708 --> 01:01:06.583
The player may then
choose a method of murder.

1414
01:01:06.583 --> 01:01:09.291
ranging from ripping
the heart out

1415
01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:12.250
to pulling off the
head of the opponent

1416
01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:14.250
with spinal cord attached.

1417
01:01:14.250 --> 01:01:16.583
- I personally delighted in it.

1418
01:01:16.583 --> 01:01:21.583
because we saw a clear
effect every time someone

1419
01:01:21.583 --> 01:01:26.208
was making a big deal in the
press about Mortal Kombat.

1420
01:01:26.208 --> 01:01:30.208
it was on TV. we saw the sales
in the home product jump up.

1421
01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:32.541
And if we happened to have
something in the arcade.

1422
01:01:32.541 --> 01:01:35.875
you know. it was probably also
seeing the benefit of a jump.

1423
01:01:35.875 --> 01:01:37.958
- And we hope very
much that you step ba

1424
01:01:37.958 --> 01:01:40.416
and take into account

1425
01:01:40.416 --> 01:01:44.000
our counter-responsibilities
as citizens here.

1426
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.916
and not only as people
who are employed

1427
01:01:45.916 --> 01:01:48.416
to maximize profits.

1428
01:01:48.416 --> 01:01:53.125
- Then you had the issue
of Nintendo and Sega.

1429
01:01:55.958 --> 01:01:57.958
- We were starting to encroach

1430
01:01:57.958 --> 01:02:00.375
on Nintendo's share of market.

1431
01:02:00.375 --> 01:02:03.750
And one of the reasonswas that we were appealing

1432
01:02:03.750 --> 01:02:05.375
to an older age group.

1433
01:02:05.375 --> 01:02:08.750
And part of that older age
appeal became Mortal Kombat

1434
01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:10.375
in its original form.

1435
01:02:10.708 --> 01:02:12.250
- the Nintendo version
was very neutered

1436
01:02:13.333 --> 01:02:15.458
The blood was turned
into like a sweat.

1437
01:02:16.916 --> 01:02:18.500
- People who played it
knew what was happening.

1438
01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.500
So I thought that was
a silly thing to do

1439
01:02:20.500 --> 01:02:22.958
And I thought it
detracted from the game

1440
01:02:22.958 --> 01:02:25.208
So I was committed that
we were going to show

1441
01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:29.000
all the blood that existed
in the arcade version

1442
01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.416
of Mortal Kombat.

1443
01:02:30.416 --> 01:02:31.583
- It had that blood code.

1444
01:02:31.583 --> 01:02:33.541
It had two codes.

1445
01:02:33.541 --> 01:02:37.375
It had the A-B-A-C-A-B-B.
the main blood code.

1446
01:02:37.375 --> 01:02:38.916
and then it had
the builder code.

1447
01:02:38.916 --> 01:02:40.416
down-up-left-left-A-right-down

1448
01:02:40.416 --> 01:02:42.041
for the cheat menu.

1449
01:02:42.041 --> 01:02:44.291
And then you could get Reptile
and do all this other stuff.

1450
01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:48.916
And yeah. so the Genesis
version was the version.

1451
01:02:48.916 --> 01:02:51.833
as far as anyone I
knew was concerned.

1452
01:02:51.833 --> 01:02:54.375
This NES version
was just a wreck.

1453
01:02:54.375 --> 01:02:56.541
- We wanted to be different.

1454
01:02:56.541 --> 01:02:58.083
We wanted to be edgy.

1455
01:02:58.083 --> 01:03:00.416
We wanted to make the
point that we weren't

1456
01:03:00.416 --> 01:03:04.041
this nice. clean. young kids
company that Nintendo was.

1457
01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:07.250
- Sega used the slogan like.
we do what Nintendon't.

1458
01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:08.541
Nintendo would never do this

1459
01:03:08.541 --> 01:03:09.875
because they're so
family-friendly.

1460
01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:11.083
But we do other things.

1461
01:03:11.083 --> 01:03:12.416
And there's something like

1462
01:03:12.416 --> 01:03:14.625
really delightfully
salacious about that

1463
01:03:14.625 --> 01:03:18.958
- We outsold the
Nintendo version by
about five to 10 times

1464
01:03:18.958 --> 01:03:22.625
more than what sold on
the Nintendo system.

1465
01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:24.500
- Will you ever draw
the line where you say

1466
01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:25.041
it's too violent?

1467
01:03:26.916 --> 01:03:28.875
- Yeah. there's. of course.
we're gonna draw the line.

1468
01:03:28.875 --> 01:03:29.666
sure. yeah.

1469
01:03:31.083 --> 01:03:35.625
[metallic slicing]
[body parts plopping]

1470
01:03:36.958 --> 01:03:39.625
- [Game] Scorpion
wins. fatality.

1471
01:03:42.250 --> 01:03:45.000
- There's an ad for a
poster in the Attract Mode

1472
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:46.666
for Revolution X.

1473
01:03:46.666 --> 01:03:49.583
And since playing through
that game start to finish.

1474
01:03:49.583 --> 01:03:52.708
I've been one button click
away about four times

1475
01:03:52.708 --> 01:03:54.541
from buying that poster on Ebay.

1476
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.000
It's got the girl with
the New World Order.

1477
01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.791
no was it. the New Order?

1478
01:04:00.583 --> 01:04:02.041
But yeah. that game.

1479
01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.333
I would really like to know.

1480
01:04:04.333 --> 01:04:05.958
I'm looking forward to
watching this finished product.

1481
01:04:05.958 --> 01:04:08.208
because I hope you have the
story about how that game

1482
01:04:08.208 --> 01:04:11.500
came to be in there.
because...what the hell?

1483
01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:21.000
[George Petro] - I got this
speech two times from Neil

1484
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.875
It was like. "Okay. you can
do whatever you want. but."

1485
01:04:24.875 --> 01:04:28.083
[laughs] "it comes from
these three choices.

1486
01:04:28.083 --> 01:04:31.541
"sports. driving.
fighting. or gun.

1487
01:04:31.541 --> 01:04:33.791
"You can't do sports.
you can't do driving.

1488
01:04:33.791 --> 01:04:34.958
"and you can't do fighting.

1489
01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:37.125
"So take your pick."

1490
01:04:37.125 --> 01:04:39.333
It was. so I guess we're
doing another gun game.

1491
01:04:39.708 --> 01:04:42.500
It was supposed to be
Generation X with Public Enemy.

1492
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.541
That was the original
concept. yeah.

1493
01:04:45.541 --> 01:04:47.333
So two things happened.

1494
01:04:47.333 --> 01:04:50.250
Number one. we got a letter
from. I believe it was Marvel

1495
01:04:50.250 --> 01:04:53.000
that said. "We own
Generation X. so back off."

1496
01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:56.958
- I remember George being
very. very angry about that.

1497
01:04:58.500 --> 01:05:00.958
He wanted to put into Generation
I remember him saying.

1498
01:05:00.958 --> 01:05:02.625
"You know what. I'm so
pissed at this. I'm so angry.

1499
01:05:02.625 --> 01:05:04.541
"I think we should put
some sort of superhero

1500
01:05:04.541 --> 01:05:06.958
"all in yellow spandex that
you get to shoot a lot."

1501
01:05:06.958 --> 01:05:09.041
- The second was
is Public Enemy.

1502
01:05:09.041 --> 01:05:10.250
who would have
nothing to do with us.

1503
01:05:10.250 --> 01:05:11.916
So. don't know why.

1504
01:05:11.916 --> 01:05:16.541
So we had to really like.
okay. strike one and two.

1505
01:05:16.541 --> 01:05:17.916
So what are we going to do now?

1506
01:05:17.916 --> 01:05:19.500
So we changed the
name to Revolution X.

1507
01:05:19.500 --> 01:05:22.250
and we started thinking really
hard about who we would have.

1508
01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:24.000
We knew we wanted
music in the game.

1509
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:28.750
- Initial premise was that
we were going to get bands.

1510
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:30.875
plural. together.

1511
01:05:32.625 --> 01:05:34.000
we do country-western

1512
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.625
do hard rock.

1513
01:05:35.625 --> 01:05:38.750
Do this. do this. and it
was just like. seriously?

1514
01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:42.625
- Our marketing person. Roger
Sharpe. God love him. said.

1515
01:05:42.625 --> 01:05:46.291
"Jack. how would
you like to go out

1516
01:05:46.291 --> 01:05:48.125
"and speak with Aerosmith?

1517
01:05:49.750 --> 01:05:51.083
"What do you think
of Aerosmith?"

1518
01:05:51.083 --> 01:05:53.625
And I'm like. my God.
Aerosmith is awesome.

1519
01:05:53.625 --> 01:05:55.708

01:11:53.375 --> 01:11:55.000
this is definitely a step
in the right direction.

1689
01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.291
That's what I
think is different.

1690
01:11:57.291 --> 01:12:00.166
It's history. man.
history in the making

1691
01:12:00.166 --> 01:12:02.250
- One thing that I think
really sunk it home

1692
01:12:02.250 --> 01:12:04.958
for a lot of these guys
who were still at Midway

1693
01:12:04.958 --> 01:12:06.625
was that Eugene Jarvis.

1694
01:12:06.625 --> 01:12:08.625
who used to be one of
their fellow coworkers.

1695
01:12:08.625 --> 01:12:10.708
had left Midway.

1696
01:12:10.708 --> 01:12:14.125
And I think that kind of
put in each of their minds

1697
01:12:14.125 --> 01:12:19.000
that there's opportunities
for their talent.

1698
01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.500
- At one point. we were
contacted by Universal Studios.

1699
01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.958
- They wanted to spin a
story around this new thing

1700
01:12:27.958 --> 01:12:30.541
called GameWorks that they
were trying to start off.

1701
01:12:30.541 --> 01:12:32.250
- [Announcer] GameWorks.

1702
01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:34.250
the ultimate
entertainment destination.

1703
01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:36.625
Games. drinks. music. and food.

1704
01:12:36.625 --> 01:12:38.125
- And so they were looking
for people to develop

1705
01:12:38.125 --> 01:12:41.958
their location-based
arcade game.

1706
01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:43.583
- So we go on this
ridiculous trip

1707
01:12:43.583 --> 01:12:46.416
where the Universal jet that
Steven Spielberg flies on

1708
01:12:46.416 --> 01:12:48.041
is showing up at Midway Airport.

1709
01:12:48.041 --> 01:12:51.000
and we're all to get on
it and like fly out to.

1710
01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.666
fly out to California.

1711
01:12:52.666 --> 01:12:56.583
And it was. it was the
best experience ever.

1712
01:12:56.583 --> 01:12:58.750
Number one. it turns out you
can get to LA in like two hours

1713
01:12:58.750 --> 01:13:01.041
if you fly really fast.

1714
01:13:02.125 --> 01:13:04.125
We meet with the
president of Universal.

1715
01:13:04.125 --> 01:13:06.375
We have lunch with
him in the commissary

1716
01:13:06.375 --> 01:13:09.125
Like. here's all these
goofy video game guys.

1717
01:13:09.125 --> 01:13:12.250
- So I was usually the guy
that would have the balls

1718
01:13:12.250 --> 01:13:14.416
to like propose some numbers.

1719
01:13:14.416 --> 01:13:16.541
or you know. paint the picture.

1720
01:13:16.541 --> 01:13:18.708
- It was just the
epitome of Mark.

1721
01:13:18.708 --> 01:13:20.958
just throwing out
these huge numbers

1722
01:13:20.958 --> 01:13:23.375
that they're gonna demand.

1723
01:13:23.375 --> 01:13:26.375
And it was fun. because it
was like this confidence

1724
01:13:26.375 --> 01:13:30.583
with these guys that they
realize they were the value.

1725
01:13:30.583 --> 01:13:34.708
- I remember hearing all of
the rumors of competitors

1726
01:13:34.708 --> 01:13:36.875
courting our guys.

1727
01:13:36.875 --> 01:13:39.291
- Some of the guys would
be getting comments.

1728
01:13:39.291 --> 01:13:42.250
innuendos. and remarks
from management

1729
01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:45.750
about your obligation to
the employee agreements.

1730
01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:47.250
Well. what would
happen if they left.

1731
01:13:47.250 --> 01:13:50.000
- If they were gonna
screw us and leave.

1732
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.625
we're gonna sue the
crap out of them.

1733
01:13:52.625 --> 01:13:56.416
because we created this
contractual relationship.

1734
01:13:56.416 --> 01:13:59.291
which prevented them from
working for a competitor

1735
01:13:59.291 --> 01:14:02.291
for at least a year
after they left us.

1736
01:14:02.291 --> 01:14:04.875
- And it was more about
making your life difficult

1737
01:14:04.875 --> 01:14:06.708
than it was about the
clause actually being legal.

1738
01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.000
It was about suing you

1739
01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:09.583
and you having to
defend yourself.

1740
01:14:09.583 --> 01:14:11.083
and him having
more money than you

1741
01:14:11.083 --> 01:14:12.125
and being able to
outspend you with lawyers.

1742
01:14:12.125 --> 01:14:13.333
just making your life difficult.

1743
01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:15.375
So other employers
didn't want to hire you.

1744
01:14:15.375 --> 01:14:16.916
- In the pinball area.

1745
01:14:16.916 --> 01:14:21.625
when a bunch of guys
left our pinball business

1746
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:25.791
to work for an upstart.

1747
01:14:25.791 --> 01:14:30.333
we unleashed our legal dogs

1748
01:14:30.333 --> 01:14:35.083
on everybody associated
with that to sue them.

1749
01:14:36.833 --> 01:14:39.416
take them to court. and make
their lives so miserable

1750
01:14:39.416 --> 01:14:42.000
that they would just
eventually throw up their hands

1751
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.291
and say. "We give up."

1752
01:14:45.500 --> 01:14:48.250
- You know. he really felt
ownership over all of us.

1753
01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:50.333
You know. he would
yell and say. you know

1754
01:14:50.333 --> 01:14:51.750
"Get your ass back here!

1755
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:53.875
"What are you doing?"

1756
01:14:53.875 --> 01:14:57.000
He was pretty strong
in his opinions.

1757
01:14:58.875 --> 01:15:00.708
- Although the Universal
deal didn't get penned.

1758
01:15:00.708 --> 01:15:05.500
it did produce the negotiating
point and motivation

1759
01:15:07.333 --> 01:15:10.208
for Midway to pay these guys
what they really were worth

1760
01:15:10.208 --> 01:15:12.916
and recognize the value that
they really were bringing

1761
01:15:12.916 --> 01:15:17.000
to Midway's role and
placement in this industry.

1762
01:15:21.958 --> 01:15:24.208
[John Tobias] - I remember Ed
and I were in the studio

1763
01:15:24.208 --> 01:15:28.958
and Larry Kasanoff was brought
through by Ken Fedesna.

1764
01:15:30.541 --> 01:15:35.916
And Larry was familiar with
Midway through Terminator 2.

1765
01:15:36.208 --> 01:15:38.333
- I heard through the
grapevine that Midway

1766
01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:41.000
was testing an arcade
game that was on track

1767
01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000
to beat our Terminator 2 record.

1768
01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:44.666
We couldn't have that.

1769
01:15:44.666 --> 01:15:47.041
So partly. just to keep in
touch on a friendly basis.

1770
01:15:47.041 --> 01:15:48.625
and partly out of
competitive spirit.

1771
01:15:48.625 --> 01:15:50.166
I went to play it.

1772
01:15:50.166 --> 01:15:52.500
And I played the game in
Neil Nicastro's office

1773
01:15:52.500 --> 01:15:54.333
on the arcade for 15 minutes.

1774
01:15:54.333 --> 01:15:56.791
It was Mortal Kombat. and
I turned to him afterward.

1775
01:15:56.791 --> 01:15:58.333
and I said. "If you give
me the rights to this.

1776
01:15:58.333 --> 01:16:00.458
"I guarantee you. I promise you.

1777
01:16:00.458 --> 01:16:02.291
"I will make it in every
medium in the world.

1778
01:16:02.291 --> 01:16:06.125
"movies. TV. animation.
music. live stage

1779
01:16:06.125 --> 01:16:07.750
"you name it. 'cause
I think this Star Wars

1780
01:16:07.750 --> 01:16:09.250
"meets Enter the Dragon."

1781
01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.708
And Neil said. "You're crazy."

1782
01:16:12.333 --> 01:16:14.750
I went home and I wander
around our arcade in Westwood.

1783
01:16:14.750 --> 01:16:17.416
and I was hanging around
the Mortal Kombat game.

1784
01:16:17.416 --> 01:16:20.250
And a little 11-year-old
kid slaps a quarter down.

1785
01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:21.958
and he looks up and
he challenges me.

1786
01:16:21.958 --> 01:16:23.958
and then he beats me.

1787
01:16:23.958 --> 01:16:25.625
And he was so
empowered. you know.

1788
01:16:25.625 --> 01:16:27.875
"You lose. Sub-Zero
wins." and I lost.

1789
01:16:27.875 --> 01:16:29.208
and that kid was thrilled.

1790
01:16:29.208 --> 01:16:31.125
And I thought. I'm gonna
make this into a movie.

1791
01:16:31.125 --> 01:16:32.750
- I was an aspiring filmmaker.

1792
01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:34.291
I grew up in the
north of England.

1793
01:16:34.291 --> 01:16:36.333
and then discovered
no one made movies

1794
01:16:36.333 --> 01:16:38.041
in the north of England.

1795
01:16:38.041 --> 01:16:40.083
So I moved to London and then
discovered no one in London

1796
01:16:40.083 --> 01:16:41.291
made the kind of movies I loved.

1797
01:16:41.291 --> 01:16:43.250
So I ended up moving to LA.

1798
01:16:43.250 --> 01:16:45.083
And the first movie I
did when I moved to LA

1799
01:16:45.083 --> 01:16:46.750
was Mortal Kombat.

1800
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:48.708
And I had become
really obsessed with it

1801
01:16:48.708 --> 01:16:50.375
when I played it in
arcades in London.

1802
01:16:50.666 --> 01:16:54.333
- Paul Anderson had a
tremendously great. great.

1803
01:16:54.333 --> 01:16:56.791
great manager who kept
calling me and saying.

1804
01:16:56.791 --> 01:17:00.500
"You gotta see this guy's film."

1805
01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:02.625
And I thought. this guy's done
some small. British art film.

1806
01:17:02.625 --> 01:17:03.916
There's no way.

1807
01:17:03.916 --> 01:17:05.583
But in Paul's small.
British art film.

1808
01:17:05.583 --> 01:17:07.250
there was one three
minute fight scene.

1809
01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:09.708
And I liked the energy
of the fight scen

1810
01:17:09.708 --> 01:17:12.416
[hard rock music]

1811
01:17:12.416 --> 01:17:14.791
[man yelling]

1812
01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:28.375
- It's always a cultural clash
with the video game company

1813
01:17:28.375 --> 01:17:30.791
and the movie people. again.
because the video game people

1814
01:17:30.791 --> 01:17:33.541
are used to not having
to make story decisions.

1815
01:17:33.541 --> 01:17:34.833
Left. right. center. fine.

1816
01:17:34.833 --> 01:17:37.041
It's what. remember.
you the audience want.

1817
01:17:37.041 --> 01:17:39.750
The movie. you have to make
decisions for the character.

1818
01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:41.625
So they were
incredibly involved.

1819
01:17:41.625 --> 01:17:44.041
but it was always a little
bit of that. you know.

1820
01:17:44.041 --> 01:17:45.666
odd two cultures
meshing scenario.

1821
01:17:45.666 --> 01:17:47.458
It always is.

1822
01:17:47.458 --> 01:17:48.875
It still is with any video
game company and movie company.

1823
01:17:48.875 --> 01:17:50.958
- The first thing I
remember was thinking

1824
01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:52.375
well. how are these
guys gonna change

1825
01:17:52.375 --> 01:17:53.583
what we produced.

1826
01:17:53.833 --> 01:17:56.083
- The question in
Mortal Kombat was

1827
01:17:56.083 --> 01:17:57.583
what to do with the
finishing moves.

1828
01:17:57.583 --> 01:17:59.333
because they were
extraordinarily violent

1829
01:17:59.333 --> 01:18:01.541
It would have made
the movie Rated R.

1830
01:18:01.541 --> 01:18:04.416
which would have negated a
lot of kids from seeing it.

1831
01:18:04.416 --> 01:18:06.625
And it would have
made you lack empathy

1832
01:18:06.625 --> 01:18:08.125
with the main character.

1833
01:18:08.125 --> 01:18:09.875
If Johnny Cage ripped
people's spines out

1834
01:18:09.875 --> 01:18:12.291
in a movie. which is more
real than a video game.

1835
01:18:12.291 --> 01:18:13.625
you wouldn't have liked him.

1836
01:18:13.625 --> 01:18:15.291
- I think they ended
up being PG. right?

1837
01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:16.541
Weren't the Mortal
Kombat movies PG?

1838
01:18:16.541 --> 01:18:18.500
You can't make a
Mortal Kombat movie

1839
01:18:18.500 --> 01:18:21.125
and have it be accurate
unless it's like NC-17.

1840
01:18:21.125 --> 01:18:22.333
And then it's gonna
play in art houses.

1841
01:18:22.333 --> 01:18:23.708
and who's gonna go
see Mortal Kombat

1842
01:18:23.708 --> 01:18:26.875
in an art house?

1843
01:18:26.875 --> 01:18:29.750
Me. I probably would. but...

1844
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:31.541
- Well. the most difficult
thing in the movie

1845
01:18:31.541 --> 01:18:33.750
was actually Goro.

1846
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:38.750
- Good ol' Goro. the
last great physical

1847
01:18:38.875 --> 01:18:41.125
animatronic character
didn't work quite as well

1848
01:18:41.125 --> 01:18:42.708
as we wanted to.

1849
01:18:42.708 --> 01:18:44.041
So we had to cut down
some of the lines of Goro.

1850
01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.208
- The producers had
committed to him

1851
01:18:48.208 --> 01:18:50.625
before I became
involved in the movie.

1852
01:18:50.625 --> 01:18:52.250
So they're already building him.

1853
01:18:52.250 --> 01:18:54.708
And you know. ultimately.
I don't know whether

1854
01:18:54.708 --> 01:18:56.333
I would have gone
in that direction.

1855
01:18:56.333 --> 01:18:58.041
You know. we built Goro.

1856
01:18:58.041 --> 01:19:00.708
It was like. it was
a man in a suit.

1857
01:19:00.708 --> 01:19:04.000
who then on his shoulders
wore big. animatronic torso

1858
01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:05.750
with another two arms.

1859
01:19:05.750 --> 01:19:08.250
And of course. he just
broke down all the time.

1860
01:19:08.250 --> 01:19:10.083
Goro became like the
biggest diva on set

1861
01:19:10.083 --> 01:19:11.458
We're always waiting for Goro.

1862
01:19:13.541 --> 01:19:16.375
- So we go and we decide
we're gonna show Neil Nicastro

1863
01:19:16.375 --> 01:19:18.000
the movie before it comes out.

1864
01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.625
So we bring out this. some
bad copy of the movie.

1865
01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:22.500
and we show it to him.

1866
01:19:22.500 --> 01:19:26.958
He looks at me. he goes.
"Based out of 10. maybe a 3."

1867
01:19:26.958 --> 01:19:28.791
And so. he just hated the movie.

1868
01:19:28.791 --> 01:19:31.625
- And I remember thinking.

1869
01:19:31.625 --> 01:19:34.041
when they did the first trailer
and they used that music

1870
01:19:34.041 --> 01:19:36.416
and they basically just
showed these characters.

1871
01:19:36.416 --> 01:19:37.250
[Mortal Kombat music]

1872
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:39.250
- [Announcer] Kano.

1873
01:19:39.250 --> 01:19:40.791
Liu Kang.

1874
01:19:40.791 --> 01:19:42.541
Raiden.

1875
01:19:42.541 --> 01:19:43.500
Johnny Cage.

1876
01:19:44.583 --> 01:19:45.125
Scorpion.

1877
01:19:46.291 --> 01:19:47.083
Sub-Zero.

1878
01:19:47.958 --> 01:19:48.750
Sonya.

1879
01:19:50.625 --> 01:19:52.125
- It's not terribly imaginative.

1880
01:19:52.125 --> 01:19:54.000
I was a little disappointed.
to be honest

1881
01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.750
And then I saw it
play in cinemas.

1882
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:58.291
And I was sitting in the cinema.

1883
01:19:58.291 --> 01:19:59.958
and there's a couple of
Mortal Kombat fans. obviously.

1884
01:19:59.958 --> 01:20:01.291
in front of me.

1885
01:20:01.291 --> 01:20:02.791
And they loved it.

1886
01:20:02.791 --> 01:20:04.125
They loved it.

1887
01:20:04.125 --> 01:20:05.916
And what they loved
was that you could s

1888
01:20:05.916 --> 01:20:07.416
they were making a
mental checklist.

1889
01:20:07.416 --> 01:20:08.500
Scorpion. tick.

1890
01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:09.791
Sub-Zero. tick.

1891
01:20:09.791 --> 01:20:11.333
Raiden. tick.

1892
01:20:11.333 --> 01:20:13.083
And they actually said
that to one another.

1893
01:20:13.083 --> 01:20:14.750
It's like. oh.
they're all there.

1894
01:20:14.750 --> 01:20:16.416
- [Man] Mortal Kombat!

1895
01:20:16.416 --> 01:20:20.000
[Mortal Kombat theme music]

1896
01:20:23.125 --> 01:20:25.250
- [Announcer] Kombat begins.

1897
01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:29.041
- So now it comes the
most nerve wracking time

1898
01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:31.541
in the life of a movie
producer or director.

1899
01:20:31.541 --> 01:20:33.041
The movie's essentially done.

1900
01:20:33.041 --> 01:20:35.125
and now you're waiting
for it to be released.

1901
01:20:36.416 --> 01:20:38.375
- [Reporter] Mortal Kombat
as a video game

1902
01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:41.750
is already a two billion.
with a B. dollar business.

1903
01:20:41.750 --> 01:20:44.250
The take is going up this
weekend with the debut

1904
01:20:44.250 --> 01:20:45.916
of the feature film
based on the game.

1905
01:20:45.916 --> 01:20:47.791
starring Christopher
Lambert as Raiden.

1906
01:20:47.791 --> 01:20:49.375
- New Line calls me up and says.

1907
01:20:49.375 --> 01:20:50.791
"I've never seen
numbers like this.

1908
01:20:50.791 --> 01:20:52.375
"We're breaking records
all over the world."

1909
01:20:52.375 --> 01:20:54.000
You go. oh. thank goodness.

1910
01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:56.333
And then you have
a great weekend.

1911
01:20:56.625 --> 01:20:58.625
- I mean. he was a
very smart producer.

1912
01:20:58.625 --> 01:21:00.333
This guy got Mortal
Kombat. you know.

1913
01:21:00.333 --> 01:21:02.250
and set it up as a movie.

1914
01:21:02.250 --> 01:21:03.791
when a lot of people.
I think. were doubting

1915
01:21:03.791 --> 01:21:06.708
whether it was good idea to
adapt video games or not.

1916
01:21:06.708 --> 01:21:09.250
- Did Neil ever own up
to his prediction to me

1917
01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:11.625
that I was crazy and it
would be an utter failure?

1918
01:21:11.625 --> 01:21:13.250
I don't think he did.

1919
01:21:13.250 --> 01:21:14.750
I think he probably
owes me that.

1920
01:21:17.375 --> 01:21:19.958
[Neil Nicastro] - We
had a very entrepreneurial

1921
01:21:19.958 --> 01:21:25.041
compensation structure so that
if you were running a team.

1922
01:21:25.041 --> 01:21:29.750
and that game became
very successful.

1923
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:31.416
you were gonna make
a lot of money.

1924
01:21:31.416 --> 01:21:35.000
Guys were walking away with
million-dollar checks. plus.

1925
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.250
- They had a limit of how
much bonus money

1926
01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:39.250
they would ever pay
you over one title.

1927
01:21:39.250 --> 01:21:40.416
I think it was $2 million.

1928
01:21:40.416 --> 01:21:42.875
And as Neil explained
it. it's like.

1929
01:21:42.875 --> 01:21:45.000
"Well. I'm not gonna pay you
any more than $2 million.

1930
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.291
"because the moment I do.

1931
01:21:46.291 --> 01:21:48.291
"you don't need to
come into work anymore

1932
01:21:48.291 --> 01:21:50.125
"And I want you to carry
on making games for us."

1933
01:21:50.125 --> 01:21:52.083
- Each team was
really competitive.

1934
01:21:52.083 --> 01:21:54.750
Ed Boon and I were
kind of at the top

1935
01:21:54.750 --> 01:21:56.541
of the competition scale.

1936
01:21:56.541 --> 01:21:57.791
I don't know if
this is true or not.

1937
01:21:57.791 --> 01:21:59.458
but Ken Fedesna actually told me

1938
01:21:59.458 --> 01:22:03.375
that when it came time
to negotiate contracts.

1939
01:22:03.375 --> 01:22:06.250
Ed wanted to make
sure he had a salary

1940
01:22:06.250 --> 01:22:08.791
that was one dollar
higher than my salary

1941
01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:13.250
- We were talking about
the compensation structure

1942
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:16.625
and how some may view that as

1943
01:22:18.458 --> 01:22:20.666
creating a bad atmosphere
where you're pitting teams

1944
01:22:20.666 --> 01:22:21.666
against each other.

1945
01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:26.208
And I could understand
and appreciate that.

1946
01:22:26.208 --> 01:22:28.500
Some people think
that is destructive.

1947
01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:31.875
But I think those are the
same. you know. thoughts

1948
01:22:31.875 --> 01:22:35.583
that think that communist
consciousness works.

1949
01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:39.041
that we have a
desire to work hard

1950
01:22:39.041 --> 01:22:42.291
for the benefit
of our fellow man.

1951
01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:43.791
I think that's bullshit.

1952
01:22:43.791 --> 01:22:48.708
- Everybody. every
designer. every developer

1953
01:22:48.708 --> 01:22:51.291
on the Williams. and
I'm still to this day.

1954
01:22:51.291 --> 01:22:54.250
I think of them as
the Williams side.

1955
01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:58.916
were very. went out of their
way to make us feel welcome.

1956
01:22:58.916 --> 01:23:00.458
but in a way that
was very different

1957
01:23:00.458 --> 01:23:05.250
from what we were used
to at old Bally Midway.

1958
01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:08.041
I mean. guys like
Eugene and Jack Haeger

1959
01:23:08.041 --> 01:23:12.041
and Ed and Mark. all would
come up to us and say.

1960
01:23:12.041 --> 01:23:14.625
"Hey. this is the
way it works here."

1961
01:23:14.625 --> 01:23:17.958
and "Glad to have you guys.

1962
01:23:17.958 --> 01:23:19.250
"You're gonna do
great stuff here.

1963
01:23:19.250 --> 01:23:21.000
"but don't go talk to them.

1964
01:23:22.625 --> 01:23:23.958
"They're not doing it right."

1965
01:23:23.958 --> 01:23:25.375
- And it would just push them.

1966
01:23:25.375 --> 01:23:26.708
People have that drive.

1967
01:23:26.708 --> 01:23:29.500
It would just push
them to do better

1968
01:23:29.500 --> 01:23:34.125
because the people that just
wanna help everybody else out.

1969
01:23:34.125 --> 01:23:37.416
they typically don't
have that burning desire

1970
01:23:37.416 --> 01:23:38.958
to prove something.

1971
01:23:38.958 --> 01:23:40.583
- If you look at thehistory of the department.

1972
01:23:40.583 --> 01:23:42.250
we started out with nothing.

1973
01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:46.500
And we had to build this
whole department. and get.

1974
01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.125
I mean. we were nobody.

1975
01:23:48.125 --> 01:23:50.333
and we were fighting like
the Ataris of the world.

1976
01:23:50.333 --> 01:23:52.875
And there was a point
when we all were together.

1977
01:23:52.875 --> 01:23:54.625
Like everybody's like clicking.

1978
01:23:54.625 --> 01:23:56.583
We're all working
with each other.

1979
01:23:56.583 --> 01:23:59.250
And then. you know.
I'll be very honest.

1980
01:23:59.250 --> 01:24:01.625
success came and screwed
the whole thing up.

1981
01:24:01.833 --> 01:24:03.583
- Footage came from
the Tokyo Game Show.

1982
01:24:03.583 --> 01:24:05.083
- [Game] Ready. go!

1983
01:24:05.083 --> 01:24:08.250
[fighting and punching]

1984
01:24:09.666 --> 01:24:12.000
- And the footage was
of Virtual Fighter

1985
01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.000
And the moment that was seen.

1986
01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:15.875
everybody looked at
each other and went.

1987
01:24:15.875 --> 01:24:16.875
"We need to be doing this."

1988
01:24:16.875 --> 01:24:18.125
And then forced their turn.

1989
01:24:18.125 --> 01:24:19.750
This was when Mortal
Kombat 3 was happening.

1990
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:21.500
They turned to Ed. and
Ed's like. "I'm not ready.

1991
01:24:21.500 --> 01:24:23.083
"I'm elbow-deep in
Mortal Kombat 3.

1992
01:24:23.083 --> 01:24:24.708
"I'm not doing this."

1993
01:24:24.708 --> 01:24:26.583
And so this other team that
was making a tank game

1994
01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:28.875
decided. we're gonna
make a fighting game

1995
01:24:28.875 --> 01:24:33.000
[inspirational musical burst]

1996
01:24:33.000 --> 01:24:34.958
- We were making a fighting
game in the company

1997
01:24:34.958 --> 01:24:36.250
that made Mortal Kombat.

1998
01:24:36.250 --> 01:24:37.541
And I think that was
a huge challenge.

1999
01:24:37.541 --> 01:24:39.083
because I think a
lot of people thought

2000
01:24:39.083 --> 01:24:43.625
War Gods was going to be
Mortal Kombat 4. or whatever.

2001
01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:44.875
And it was not.

2002
01:24:44.875 --> 01:24:46.875
- You know. it seemed
like thematically.

2003
01:24:46.875 --> 01:24:50.500
they were a little closer.
too close to Mortal Kombat.

2004
01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:53.250
- It was unadulteratedly
a ripoff of Mortal Kombat.

2005
01:24:53.250 --> 01:24:54.958
They used all exact
control mechanisms

2006
01:24:54.958 --> 01:24:56.541
with the joysticks
and the buttons.

2007
01:24:56.541 --> 01:24:58.333
It was just. it was no
beating around the bush.

2008
01:24:58.333 --> 01:25:00.583
This was Mortal
Kombat. but in 3D.

2009
01:25:00.583 --> 01:25:02.666
[characters yelling]

2010
01:25:02.666 --> 01:25:04.250
- Nobody had it.

2011
01:25:04.250 --> 01:25:06.041
Nobody has a corner
on ideas. you know?

2012
01:25:06.041 --> 01:25:07.958
Just kind of ideas
come and flow.

2013
01:25:07.958 --> 01:25:10.583
and we needed to do what
was best for the department.

2014
01:25:10.583 --> 01:25:14.041
But it could get very
difficult sometime

2015
01:25:14.041 --> 01:25:16.791
- People would
walk past an office

2016
01:25:16.791 --> 01:25:19.000
where some of the Mortal
Kombat guys were in there.

2017
01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.583
If you were on
the War Gods team.

2018
01:25:20.583 --> 01:25:22.500
they would literally shut
the door in your face.

2019
01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:25.375
- Did we get any help from
the MK guys on War Gods?

2020
01:25:25.375 --> 01:25:26.875
And that answer is zero.

2021
01:25:26.875 --> 01:25:30.291
- It was. it was ugly. [laughs]

2022
01:25:30.291 --> 01:25:31.750
- You know. that's the way.

2023
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:34.000
you know. the way
management pitted the teams

2024
01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.333
against each other.

2025
01:25:35.333 --> 01:25:37.333
That kind of didn't
help the situation.

2026
01:25:37.333 --> 01:25:39.958
- I think I remember
one of the reviews.

2027
01:25:39.958 --> 01:25:41.333
we all had a good
chuckle at this.

2028
01:25:41.333 --> 01:25:44.000
one of the reviews was
War Gods. God Awful.

2029
01:25:46.625 --> 01:25:49.000
[dance music]

2030
01:25:50.791 --> 01:25:53.000
[Eugene Jarvis]- Well. we had
been working on Cruis'n project

2031
01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.250
for. God. I don't know. maybe.

2032
01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:58.166
I guess two-and-a-half.
maybe only three years.

2033
01:25:59.708 --> 01:26:02.125
You know. we were
running out of money

2034
01:26:02.125 --> 01:26:07.541
and kind of over budget
and over time [laughs]

2035
01:26:08.375 --> 01:26:12.250
- At the time. Nintendo
was touting their Ultra 64.

2036
01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:14.291
[Announcer] - Project Reality.

2037
01:26:15.875 --> 01:26:17.583
Leagues beyond any
currently available

2038
01:26:17.583 --> 01:26:19.250
or anticipated hardware.

2039
01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:22.250
Project Reality will bring
to home video players

2040
01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:25.000
the same types of
astounding visual effects

2041
01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.250
seen in movies.
like Terminator 2.

2042
01:26:27.250 --> 01:26:29.708
- They were making
a push just to show

2043
01:26:29.708 --> 01:26:31.916
that we've got this
incredibly powerful.

2044
01:26:31.916 --> 01:26:36.041
polygon generating
new video game system

2045
01:26:36.041 --> 01:26:40.708
- So the Ultra 64 was really
vaporware at the time.

2046
01:26:40.708 --> 01:26:42.291
They didn't have anything.

2047
01:26:42.291 --> 01:26:43.958
They were a year away.

2048
01:26:43.958 --> 01:26:48.958
So they came to Neil Nicastro
and they came to Williams

2049
01:26:48.958 --> 01:26:51.250
and said. "Listen.
what do you guys have

2050
01:26:51.250 --> 01:26:53.208
- You know. went to
Eugene. and I said.

2051
01:26:53.208 --> 01:26:56.208
"Hey Gene. if I can get
you this amount of money."

2052
01:26:56.208 --> 01:26:58.958
I think it was "give
me all your rights

2053
01:26:58.958 --> 01:27:00.583
"to the home side of it."

2054
01:27:00.583 --> 01:27:02.791
Eugene says "Yes.
if you get me X.

2055
01:27:02.791 --> 01:27:05.208
"I'll be happy with that."

2056
01:27:05.208 --> 01:27:08.041
And then we ended up getting
another figure from Nintendo

2057
01:27:08.041 --> 01:27:10.708
that was like a
big multiple of X.

2058
01:27:10.708 --> 01:27:13.583
- And so we decided

2059
01:27:13.583 --> 01:27:17.416
rather than going broke. that
we would go back to Midway.

2060
01:27:17.416 --> 01:27:19.750
[laughs]

2061
01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:22.250
- So Nintendo was bragging
that it was going to based

2062
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:24.625
on the N64 and
everything else and stuff

2063
01:27:24.625 --> 01:27:27.291
Well. of course. showing
it at the CES Show

2064
01:27:27.291 --> 01:27:29.250
was not running on N64.

2065
01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:31.416
It wasn't anywhere near N64.

2066
01:27:31.416 --> 01:27:33.250
- You know. we kinda had to
swallow hard on that one.

2067
01:27:33.250 --> 01:27:35.958
because it was. it
was our hardware.

2068
01:27:35.958 --> 01:27:37.916
It was hardware that
we created in there

2069
01:27:37.916 --> 01:27:40.791
And they were labeling
it the Nintendo hardware.

2070
01:27:40.791 --> 01:27:45.166
- [Announcer] Only
on Nintendo Ultra 64.

2071
01:27:47.250 --> 01:27:49.958
- Nintendo system being
in the Cruis'n game?

2072
01:27:49.958 --> 01:27:51.708
Somebody in their marketing
department made that up

2073
01:27:51.708 --> 01:27:53.375
after the fact.

2074
01:27:53.375 --> 01:27:55.083
[video game music]

2075
01:27:55.083 --> 01:27:56.750
- When the Nintendo
thing came along.

2076
01:27:56.750 --> 01:27:59.041
it enabled us to come
back and really ha

2077
01:27:59.041 --> 01:28:01.291
a longer runway for
us to finish the game

2078
01:28:01.291 --> 01:28:05.375
And the advantage that
we had by doing that was.

2079
01:28:05.375 --> 01:28:07.208
I'm not saying that we
were doing it in a bubble.

2080
01:28:07.208 --> 01:28:10.625
But we weren't amongst
the Turmells of the world

2081
01:28:10.625 --> 01:28:12.625
and the Boons of the
world. and so on.

2082
01:28:12.625 --> 01:28:15.416
that could give us
valuable information.

2083
01:28:15.416 --> 01:28:17.333
- And they were kinda
brutal on our game

2084
01:28:17.333 --> 01:28:18.625
I mean. the Cruis'n USA.

2085
01:28:18.625 --> 01:28:22.708
I remember Fedesna was
like. "Yeah. snoozin'."

2086
01:28:22.708 --> 01:28:23.750
That was his term for it.

2087
01:28:23.750 --> 01:28:24.875
- I do remember that.

2088
01:28:26.416 --> 01:28:28.708
But I don't remember
who gave it that name.

2089
01:28:28.708 --> 01:28:31.333
But it had to be one
of the other guys.

2090
01:28:31.333 --> 01:28:33.125
It wasn't me that gave
it the name Snoozin'.

2091
01:28:33.125 --> 01:28:35.333
- Here was the guy
that abandoned them

2092
01:28:35.333 --> 01:28:36.583
in the coming back.

2093
01:28:36.583 --> 01:28:40.208
And it was a little bit
awkward for a while.

2094
01:28:40.208 --> 01:28:41.958
- Oh. when that game
came in. it was garbage.

2095
01:28:41.958 --> 01:28:44.125
It was like. it
was such garbage.

2096
01:28:44.125 --> 01:28:46.583
And Eugene knew it. too.

2097
01:28:46.583 --> 01:28:48.083
That's why he came back in.

2098
01:28:48.083 --> 01:28:49.875
He was wise enough
to know he needed.

2099
01:28:49.875 --> 01:28:53.958
you know. he needed that punch.
that he would get Turmell.

2100
01:28:53.958 --> 01:28:55.000
I mean. Turmell would
sit around that ga

2101
01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.958
and just write stuff.

2102
01:28:56.958 --> 01:28:58.250
You know. I would talk about it.

2103
01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:00.250
- We got that energy.
like that negative vibe.

2104
01:29:00.250 --> 01:29:03.000
like. you know. like
ooh. you know. like

2105
01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.541
and then we got movin'
and it was cool.

2106
01:29:05.541 --> 01:29:08.083
It was really cool to
get that frank input.

2107
01:29:08.083 --> 01:29:14.041
What really hurts is
the truth [laughs]

2108
01:29:14.583 --> 01:29:17.500
- The common denominator
in everything that we did

2109
01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:19.541
was that we all
worked for Eugene.

2110
01:29:19.541 --> 01:29:23.250
And we all like. we all
grew up on Eugene's games.

2111
01:29:23.250 --> 01:29:25.375
Ask Mark Turmell. Eugene fan.

2112
01:29:25.375 --> 01:29:26.916
Ask Ed.

2113
01:29:26.916 --> 01:29:27.833
You know. we all
worked for Eugene.

2114
01:29:27.833 --> 01:29:29.125
He was our guy. you know?

2115
01:29:29.125 --> 01:29:33.208
He was Stan Lee. man. [laughs]

2116
01:29:33.208 --> 01:29:37.208
- Cruis'n was a huge
commercial success.

2117
01:29:37.208 --> 01:29:41.958
But critically. actually.
it took a lot of flack.

2118
01:29:42.875 --> 01:29:46.000
because it was more of a
casual player's driving game.

2119
01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:49.416
Actually appealed
a lot to girls.

2120
01:29:49.416 --> 01:29:52.791
Like teenage girls loved
the driving mechanic

2121
01:29:52.791 --> 01:29:55.000
and loved. you know.
like pre-drivers.

2122
01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:57.083
like practicing
for their license.

2123
01:29:58.208 --> 01:30:00.250
- The startup cost to going
to play a fighting game

2124
01:30:00.250 --> 01:30:02.250
is high. right. like
everyone's paying attention.

2125
01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:04.708
and you're having to
play with another person.

2126
01:30:04.708 --> 01:30:06.791
You're probably looking for a
slightly different experience.

2127
01:30:06.791 --> 01:30:08.125
You might be lookingfor a machine

2128
01:30:08.125 --> 01:30:09.791
that's not as crowded
so you can go play

2129
01:30:09.791 --> 01:30:10.958
and kind of be left alone.

2130
01:30:11.125 --> 01:30:12.625
- You know. we just
took all this flack.

2131
01:30:12.625 --> 01:30:15.291
that we were sellouts.
and our game sucked.

2132
01:30:15.291 --> 01:30:16.958
and there was no skill.

2133
01:30:16.958 --> 01:30:21.708
And you know what's crazy is
I look at Cruis'n USA today

2134
01:30:21.708 --> 01:30:24.750
and from today's
standards. which is.

2135
01:30:24.750 --> 01:30:27.333
I guess 28-odd years later.

2136
01:30:27.333 --> 01:30:29.333
The game actually is
horribly difficult [laughs]

2137
01:30:31.583 --> 01:30:33.291
So if you put it out
in an arcade today.

2138
01:30:33.291 --> 01:30:35.333
people would refuse to
play it. it's so hard.

2139
01:30:36.416 --> 01:30:40.708
[voice speaking on overhead]

2140
01:30:40.708 --> 01:30:43.541
[music]

2141
01:30:48.458 --> 01:30:52.125
- When I interviewed Ed and
John about Mortal Kombat 3.

2142
01:30:52.125 --> 01:30:54.250
we had already spoken
a few times before

2143
01:30:54.250 --> 01:30:56.625
and I said. you know.
"You're on your third game.

2144
01:30:56.625 --> 01:30:58.250
"Are you tired?"

2145
01:30:58.250 --> 01:31:00.083
And they actually did
sound a little bit tired.

2146
01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:02.833
- [Ed Boon] To some degree.

2147
01:31:02.833 --> 01:31:05.125
we've become like a
Mortal Kombat factory

2148
01:31:05.125 --> 01:31:09.291
in the sense that we
know exactly how to
do the backgrounds.

2149
01:31:09.291 --> 01:31:11.041
We know exactly how
to do characters.

2150
01:31:11.041 --> 01:31:14.583
We know how to do all the
throws. and the filming.

2151
01:31:14.583 --> 01:31:16.125
We're just like
an assembly line.

2152
01:31:16.125 --> 01:31:17.666
- [Dan Amrich] Right.

2153
01:31:17.666 --> 01:31:19.291
- [Ed Boon] So in that respect.
we're like. you know.

2154
01:31:19.291 --> 01:31:20.500
you kinda wish at getting
a chance to do something

2155
01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:21.916
completely different.

2156
01:31:21.916 --> 01:31:24.416
- Apparently. there
was at the time a pitch

2157
01:31:24.416 --> 01:31:26.125
for a Star Wars game.

2158
01:31:26.125 --> 01:31:27.291
And when we started
talking about

2159
01:31:27.291 --> 01:31:28.958
what that potential
Star Wars game could be.

2160
01:31:28.958 --> 01:31:30.791
on the record. they lit up.

2161
01:31:30.791 --> 01:31:32.375
They were so happy.

2162
01:31:32.375 --> 01:31:33.875
And I could tell. these guys
need their batteries recharged.

2163
01:31:33.875 --> 01:31:36.375
They needed to shift
gears out of Mortal Kombat

2164
01:31:36.375 --> 01:31:39.208
to keep Mortal Kombat
interesting for themselves.

2165
01:31:39.208 --> 01:31:42.541
And I really believe that
that's what The Grid became.

2166
01:31:42.541 --> 01:31:48.791
The Grid was a six-player
competitive death match game

2167
01:31:48.958 --> 01:31:52.125
with completely
different controls.

2168
01:31:52.125 --> 01:31:54.750
- And then it had all
these sensibilities

2169
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:56.625
that came from SmashTV.

2170
01:31:56.625 --> 01:31:58.000
- Good luck.

2171
01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000
You'll need it.

2172
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:03.541
- You've got two minutes
to get five points.

2173
01:32:03.541 --> 01:32:04.333
Good luck!

2174
01:32:06.208 --> 01:32:08.708
Mike Mika - It was trying to
be this thing that was creating

2175
01:32:08.708 --> 01:32:10.958
a sport out of this
new kind of interfac

2176
01:32:10.958 --> 01:32:12.041
a new kind of way to play.

2177
01:32:14.208 --> 01:32:15.583
It had all the makings
and the trimmings

2178
01:32:15.583 --> 01:32:18.041
of what would be a
big e-sport today.

2179
01:32:18.041 --> 01:32:20.250
but all the way
back in the '90s.

2180
01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:22.208
- We'll get people
here that it's like.

2181
01:32:22.208 --> 01:32:24.041
hey. we're gonna be
on The Grid all night

2182
01:32:24.041 --> 01:32:27.333
If anybody's saying we need
to be off. let us know.

2183
01:32:27.333 --> 01:32:29.833
just because we just
wanna grind out and play

2184
01:32:29.833 --> 01:32:31.333
for six hours of The Grid.

2185
01:32:31.333 --> 01:32:33.791
- The Grid was Ed
Boon having fun.

2186
01:32:33.791 --> 01:32:36.708
He really did. he
let it all out.

2187
01:32:36.708 --> 01:32:38.875
He let himself do
something different.

2188
01:32:38.875 --> 01:32:41.791
And you can see that
there's a joy in that game.

2189
01:32:41.791 --> 01:32:43.791
of him being able to shift gears

2190
01:32:43.791 --> 01:32:46.250
and stretch a different
part of his design brain.

2191
01:32:46.250 --> 01:32:49.500
I always see it as sort
of Ed Boon's vacation game

2192
01:32:49.500 --> 01:32:50.958
that he worked so hard on

2193
01:32:50.958 --> 01:32:53.250
that it was not a
vacation at all.

2194
01:32:53.250 --> 01:32:56.000
- We only sold 550 Grids.
it was. approximately.

2195
01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.333
There was nothing.

2196
01:32:57.333 --> 01:33:00.625
Grid earned terribly
as a single unit.

2197
01:33:00.625 --> 01:33:03.083
If you had four or
the six units togethe

2198
01:33:03.083 --> 01:33:04.750
The problem there was. though.

2199
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:07.583
you gotta buy four cabinets
or four sets of electronics

2200
01:33:07.583 --> 01:33:08.916
and everything else.

2201
01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:10.583
So now in order to
get the earnings.

2202
01:33:10.583 --> 01:33:12.208
which you're talking about.

2203
01:33:12.208 --> 01:33:15.083
you had to invest. instead of
X. you had to invest 4X.

2204
01:33:16.875 --> 01:33:18.583
- You know. the operators
expected every game

2205
01:33:18.583 --> 01:33:20.750
that comes out has
to earn. you know.

2206
01:33:20.750 --> 01:33:23.208
so much money per week.

2207
01:33:23.208 --> 01:33:25.083
There was no way that every
game was going to come out

2208
01:33:25.083 --> 01:33:26.791
and earn two grand a week.

2209
01:33:26.791 --> 01:33:29.083
It just wasn't going to happen.

2210
01:33:29.083 --> 01:33:30.875
- All management
wanted to do was just.

2211
01:33:30.875 --> 01:33:32.500
they wanted to stamp out.

2212
01:33:32.500 --> 01:33:33.875
Basically. if they
could have stamped ou

2213
01:33:33.875 --> 01:33:36.875
more Mortal Kombats.
you know. in a row.

2214
01:33:36.875 --> 01:33:38.541
that's what they would've done.

2215
01:33:38.541 --> 01:33:41.875
- We went to the well too many
times with the same mechanics

2216
01:33:41.875 --> 01:33:44.500
or not enough innovation.

2217
01:33:44.500 --> 01:33:47.500
- But it was in the late
'90s I saw the warning signs

2218
01:33:47.500 --> 01:33:50.875
that things may be
getting more difficult

2219
01:33:50.875 --> 01:33:52.083
in the coin-op area.

2220
01:33:54.041 --> 01:33:56.208
- The consoles for the home
get more sophisticated.

2221
01:33:56.208 --> 01:33:58.333
The CD-Rom is a hugely
important technology.

2222
01:33:58.333 --> 01:34:01.041
And it brings that kind
of arcade-style graphics

2223
01:34:01.041 --> 01:34:02.375
into the home.

2224
01:34:02.375 --> 01:34:06.500
- I could feel that what
we could do as a company

2225
01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:10.500
on the hardware side wasn't
going to be able to approach

2226
01:34:10.500 --> 01:34:16.666
that what a whole team of
engineers could pull off.

2227
01:34:16.958 --> 01:34:21.916
- Console gaming really
changed how I felt about games

2228
01:34:21.916 --> 01:34:24.250
because I was able
to take my time.

2229
01:34:24.250 --> 01:34:25.958
I was able to play
games without somebody

2230
01:34:25.958 --> 01:34:27.791
looking over my
shoulder and judging

2231
01:34:27.791 --> 01:34:28.916
whether I was good or not.

2232
01:34:28.916 --> 01:34:32.416
And I was able to experiment.

2233
01:34:32.416 --> 01:34:35.875
I was really happy when
consoles came about.

2234
01:34:35.875 --> 01:34:38.000
because then there
were games for me. to

2235
01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:40.375
Whereas in a arcade. there is.

2236
01:34:40.375 --> 01:34:42.541
you know. if I weren't
good at Street Fighter.

2237
01:34:42.541 --> 01:34:45.958
you know. the whole sort of
experience kind of stopped

2238
01:34:45.958 --> 01:34:47.000
at a certain level.

2239
01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:50.625
- I think the other
thing that had a huge impact

2240
01:34:50.625 --> 01:34:51.833
was the internet.

2241
01:34:51.833 --> 01:34:53.708
So the social aspect
of the arcade.

2242
01:34:53.708 --> 01:34:56.375
where that's where you would
go and trash talk your buddy

2243
01:34:56.375 --> 01:34:59.541
and friend. you could
now find ways to do that

2244
01:34:59.541 --> 01:35:02.500
playing your game. but
also via the internet.

2245
01:35:02.500 --> 01:35:04.708
- In fact. I remember an
operator telling me once.

2246
01:35:04.708 --> 01:35:09.208
when the Monica Lewinsky
conversation got published

2247
01:35:09.208 --> 01:35:13.958
on the internet. that he saw
a decline in his audience.

2248
01:35:14.416 --> 01:35:17.541
Like. it seems weird.
but the internet became

2249
01:35:17.541 --> 01:35:19.583
like this entertainment factor.

2250
01:35:19.583 --> 01:35:23.916
- I did not have sexual
relations with that woman.

2251
01:35:23.916 --> 01:35:26.708
- And people stopped
going to arcades.

2252
01:35:26.708 --> 01:35:30.000
- So it was that period
of time where. you know.

2253
01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:33.541
you feel yourself being.
you see your future.

2254
01:35:33.541 --> 01:35:36.000
and your future looks crappy.

2255
01:35:36.000 --> 01:35:37.500
And you feel

2256
01:35:38.958 --> 01:35:43.208
somewhat paralyzed to
actually make a change.

2257
01:35:43.208 --> 01:35:46.500
I'd say that's probably
the crappiest time.

2258
01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:49.500
- You know. Neil basically
had a meeting and he said.

2259
01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:51.958
"Hey. I think the
days are numbered

2260
01:35:51.958 --> 01:35:53.958
"for the coin-op business."

2261
01:35:53.958 --> 01:35:55.250
- So the writing
was on the wall.

2262
01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:57.375
Things started falling
apart very quickl

2263
01:35:57.375 --> 01:36:00.000
And you had this millions
of dollars of overhead

2264
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.791
in coin-op and it
was decided. okay.

2265
01:36:01.791 --> 01:36:03.083
we're gonna get out of coin-op

2266
01:36:03.083 --> 01:36:04.416
because there's so
much more money.

2267
01:36:04.416 --> 01:36:06.541
theoretically to be
made. on the consume

2268
01:36:06.541 --> 01:36:07.791
than there was in coin-op.

2269
01:36:07.791 --> 01:36:09.541
And that was the end of coin-op.

2270
01:36:09.541 --> 01:36:12.250
Pinball first. then came Midway.

2271
01:36:12.250 --> 01:36:13.750
as far as coin-op was concerned.

2272
01:36:22.333 --> 01:36:25.250
- Games were focused
direct-to-consumer now.

2273
01:36:25.250 --> 01:36:28.250
You know. Sony. et cetera.

2274
01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:33.000
And it took all of the
arcade mechanics out.

2275
01:36:34.250 --> 01:36:36.250
It took the ways that
we percentaged games.

2276
01:36:36.250 --> 01:36:38.500
the way we would bring
a player through a game.

2277
01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:41.500
Certainly. consumer development
is a lot more complex

2278
01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:46.250
and requires. you know.
higher structure in a team.

2279
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:47.916
and more team members.

2280
01:36:47.916 --> 01:36:52.541
But that did change what
Midway was for all those years

2281
01:36:52.541 --> 01:36:54.708
in the '80s and '90s.

2282
01:36:54.708 --> 01:36:57.083
- When you look at it sort of
in the grand scheme of things.

2283
01:36:57.083 --> 01:36:58.375
it was fairly short-lived.

2284
01:36:58.375 --> 01:37:01.000
My career at Midway
spanned. I think.

2285
01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:02.958
a little bit longer
than maybe a decade.

2286
01:37:02.958 --> 01:37:07.666
And I experienced the
rebirth and then the death

2287
01:37:07.666 --> 01:37:08.708
of an industry.

2288
01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:11.500
- You know. we had
this great thing.

2289
01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:13.083
and it was kind of like
the party was over.

2290
01:37:13.083 --> 01:37:15.083
You know. it was just
like. it's two AM.

2291
01:37:15.083 --> 01:37:16.916
Everybody's got a headache.

2292
01:37:16.916 --> 01:37:19.750
And we had. what a ride we had.

2293
01:37:22.958 --> 01:37:24.625
But they're closing
up the disco. man.

2294
01:37:28.250 --> 01:37:30.541
And you go home with a
headache. and that was it.

2295

[video game music]

2296
01:37:48.708 --> 01:37:50.083
- There was just nothing
like the experience

2297
01:37:50.083 --> 01:37:51.541
of going to an arcade.

2298
01:37:51.541 --> 01:37:55.625
It was like a dark cave
filled with simulators

2299
01:37:55.625 --> 01:37:59.250
that were like portals
to other realities

2300
01:37:59.250 --> 01:38:00.708
Like I could pilot a
starship over here.

2301
01:38:00.708 --> 01:38:02.500
or kill drug dealers over here.

2302

or be a NBA champion.

2303

You know. any fantasy
that you could have

2304
01:38:06.416 --> 01:38:07.791
you could go and
put in a quarter

2305
01:38:07.791 --> 01:38:09.541
and live out that fantasy.

2306
01:38:09.541 --> 01:38:11.500
- Whenever you think
of arcade style.

2307
01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:14.916
an arcade-style product.
a fast-paced product.

2308
01:38:14.916 --> 01:38:18.291
I think that was birthed by a
lot of what we were producing.

2309

- You cannot plan that
coalescing of the talent.

Just the way everybody
came together.

2311

these games is so ridiculous.

2312
01:38:28.416 --> 01:38:31.208
Nobody planned that.
Nobody wrote on a

2313
01:38:31.208 --> 01:38:32.583
piece of paper. now I
need a Mark Turmell.

2314
01:38:32.583 --> 01:38:34.250
Now I need an Ed Boon type.

2315
01:38:34.250 --> 01:38:36.250
Now I need a Eugene

- Remember who's
creating these games.

2317
01:38:39.666 --> 01:38:43.208
Guy from Michigan. guy from
California. guy from Illinois.

2318
01:38:43.208 --> 01:38:46.000
And as they're. they
went through their life.

Because in that era.
it was Pistons Vs Bulls

[Josh Tsui] So you're a
Detroit fan working in Chicago

2335
01:40:29.875 --> 01:40:34.000
- Yeah. I was a Piston
fan living in Chicago

2336
01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:40.625
and I had to watch the Jordan
era unfold night after night

2337

to make the Pistons

better than the Bulls.
At least in NBA JAM

2339
01:40:48.125 --> 01:40:52.166
- I first discovered the game
when I went to church

2340
01:40:52.166 --> 01:40:55.375
and I was going across the
street to get some candy

2341
01:40:55.375 --> 01:40:57.625
and I ran into this brand
new game that showed up

2342
01:40:57.625 --> 01:40:58.625
called Mortal Kombat

Blew my mind. I saw this
one person playing and...

2344
01:41:01.958 --> 01:41:05.041
it was the perfect balance
between gore and competitiveness

2345
01:41:05.041 --> 01:41:09.250
and a chance for a a nerdy
little Asian kid to actually...

be toe to toe against all
kinds of different people

I hated going to church. so
every Sunday...

2348
01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:17.041
I would tell my mom I'm going
to church all of a sudden

go across the street

loved church so much

01:41:45.916 --> 01:41:49.333
The whole meeting
felt contentious.

2359
01:41:49.333 --> 01:41:51.625
it was almost like we
were wasting their time

2360
01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:55.291
They said. "Skateboarding
is not even popular

2361
01:41:55.291 --> 01:41:58.458
"why would anyone want to play...

2362
01:41:58.458 --> 01:42:00.250
...a videogame based
on skateboarding?"

2363
01:42:00.250 --> 01:42:02.333
I've been in plenty
of pitch meetings

2364
01:42:02.333 --> 01:42:04.500
I didn't necessarily
expect everyone to

2365
01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:06.875
or there'd be bidding
war for our game

2366
01:42:06.875 --> 01:42:10.583
but at the same time I didn't
expect to be just beat down

2367
01:42:10.583 --> 01:42:15.333
I think I needed to go
through that. it me up to

2368
01:42:16.791 --> 01:42:19.708
for what became Tony
Hawk's Pro Skater
