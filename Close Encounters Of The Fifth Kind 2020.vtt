165
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.625
MAN: Look at that thing!

166
00:13:55.731 --> 00:13:59.597
Average people see UFOs
on the news. right?

167
00:13:59.631 --> 00:14:03.359
All of a sudden. it's real.
UFOs. we've been
tracking them in the sky.

168
00:14:03.394 --> 00:14:06.915
And they go.
"Okay. well. were the tin
foil hat people right?"

169
00:14:06.949 --> 00:14:10.746
It took a long time for
the mainstream media
to finally admit that.

170
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:12.921
<i>"Yeah. they are.
in fact. real."</i>

171
00:14:12.955 --> 00:14:16.200
<i>Why did we wait that long?
Why did we wait <i>
for the mainstream media</i></i>

172
00:14:16.234 --> 00:14:19.341
<i>to tell us before we finally
believed. "Hey. this is <i>
actually happening?"</i></i>

173
00:14:19.375 --> 00:14:23.586
And the challenge is.
if there's potentially
multiple narratives.

174
00:14:23.621 --> 00:14:26.279
how do you decide
which one to go with?

175
00:14:26.313 --> 00:14:29.765
Back in the 1990s.
I was read into or briefed

176
00:14:29.799 --> 00:14:33.907
on a project that involved
an inter-agency group.

177
00:14:33.942 --> 00:14:39.464
<i>that had the ability
to disclose <i>
the ET presence in a way</i></i>

178
00:14:39.499 --> 00:14:43.917
that would frighten everyone
on Earth and convince
the public that there was

179
00:14:43.952 --> 00:14:45.608
"an alien threat."

180
00:14:45.643 --> 00:14:48.266
which is completely false.
It's all a lie.

181
00:14:48.301 --> 00:14:51.235
<i>And that this
had been developed <i>
in the '50s.</i></i>

182
00:14:51.269 --> 00:14:55.618
<i>And they had been
developing the means and <i>
the psychological warfare</i></i>

183
00:14:55.653 --> 00:14:57.551
to make that happen.

184
00:14:57.586 --> 00:15:01.452
So. in the 1990s. I wrote
a paper called "When
Disclosure Serves Secrecy."

185
00:15:02.315 --> 00:15:03.799
<i>What that means is.</i>

186
00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:06.284
there are two kinds of
disclosures that
might happen.

187
00:15:06.319 --> 00:15:09.287
a truthful one that is
also a hopeful one.

188
00:15:09.322 --> 00:15:13.567
<i>which is what I gave up
my medical career <i>
to try to actuate to do.</i></i>

189
00:15:13.602 --> 00:15:15.845
And then.
there's the one
that is spun

190
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.434
<i>by the spinmeisters
in Washington.</i>

191
00:15:18.469 --> 00:15:21.817
and at The Pentagon and CIA.
which runs like this.

192
00:15:21.851 --> 00:15:23.923
<i>"It's true
the UFOs are real.</i>

193
00:15:23.957 --> 00:15:27.927
<i>"They are here as a threat.
They're violating <i>
our airspace.</i></i>

194
00:15:27.961 --> 00:15:32.241
<i>"They're a National Security
threat. and a threat. <i>
to our sovereignty."</i></i>

195
00:15:32.276 --> 00:15:33.311
I'm quoting.

196
00:15:33.346 --> 00:15:34.864
The purpose
of the program.

197
00:15:34.899 --> 00:15:38.247
advanced aerospace threat
identification program.

198
00:15:38.282 --> 00:15:41.285
was really designed
to do just that.

199
00:15:41.319 --> 00:15:43.666
From a national
security perspective.

200
00:15:43.701 --> 00:15:46.807
identify those
things that we see

201
00:15:46.842 --> 00:15:50.880
and try to ascertain and
determine if that information
is a potential threat

202
00:15:50.915 --> 00:15:52.089
to national security.

203
00:15:52.123 --> 00:15:54.022
And we knew
this was
going to happen.

204
00:15:54.056 --> 00:15:55.989
because I had met
with people

205
00:15:56.024 --> 00:16:00.442
who were in these classified
projects who were on
inter-agency committees

206
00:16:00.476 --> 00:16:02.789
that had everything set
to roll this out.

207
00:16:02.823 --> 00:16:04.515
and they were just
waiting for the right time.

208
00:16:04.549 --> 00:16:08.208
<i>The Soviet Union has ended.
We have the global terrorism.</i>

209
00:16:08.243 --> 00:16:11.039
<i>While it's still there.
it's not like it was <i>
around 9/11.</i></i>

210
00:16:11.073 --> 00:16:15.491
This is the next "big thing"
that they want the public
to be afraid of.

211
00:16:15.526 --> 00:16:19.116
When a pickpocket
meets a saint.
all he sees are his pockets.

212
00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:22.636
Or if you're a hammer.
everything looks like a nail.

213
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:26.226
It's not that this isn't
a genuine perception
on their part.

214
00:16:26.261 --> 00:16:30.506
because they've been raised.
their entire political
and professional career

215
00:16:30.541 --> 00:16:35.718
<i>has been designed to have
this kind of artificial <i>
construct of this...</i></i>

216
00:16:35.753 --> 00:16:39.550
<i>There's this national
airspace and nobody can <i>
come into the airspace</i></i>

217
00:16:39.584 --> 00:16:41.069
<i>unless we say so.</i>

218
00:16:41.103 --> 00:16:44.175
<i>And they've got
this super control <i>
mechanism going.</i></i>

219
00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.833
<i>And they're right at
this really important place <i>
right now</i></i>

220
00:16:46.867 --> 00:16:48.559
<i>where they're attempting
to establish</i>

221
00:16:48.593 --> 00:16:50.664
a kind of
one-world government.

222
00:16:50.699 --> 00:16:52.873
They've got
the communications
systems up.

223
00:16:52.908 --> 00:16:54.737
<i>The transportation
systems are up.</i>

224
00:16:54.772 --> 00:16:57.050
<i>They want to establish
a planetary government.</i>

225
00:16:57.085 --> 00:17:00.605
And there is nothing
that is going to
motivate the creation

226
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.437
of a one-world government.
like the discovery
of an ultimate other.

227
00:17:04.471 --> 00:17:09.580
Ronald Reagan was standing
in front of the United Nations
just said it out.

228
00:17:09.614 --> 00:17:13.066
Perhaps we need some
outside universal threat.

229
00:17:13.101 --> 00:17:18.071
I occasionally think
how quickly our
differences. worldwide.

230
00:17:18.106 --> 00:17:24.077
would vanish. if we were
facing an alien threat
from outside this world.

231
00:17:24.112 --> 00:17:27.598
He was silly enough to say it.
That's part of his naivete.

232
00:17:27.632 --> 00:17:29.772
But the fact is.
that is their agenda.

233
00:17:29.807 --> 00:17:32.706
NARRATOR: <i>Legendary

Daniel Sheehan</i></i>

234

235
00:17:34.605 --> 00:17:36.814
<i>fighting the National

236

<i>The Pentagon Papers

237
00:17:40.231 --> 00:17:43.096

<i>before becoming

239
00:17:46.134 --> 00:17:48.964
<i>for the Disclosure Project
in 2001.</i>

240
00:17:48.998 --> 00:17:53.072
It's helpful. of course.
for them to say.
"Oh. UFOs are real."

241
00:17:53.106 --> 00:17:54.625
<i>That's quite helpful.</i>

242
00:17:54.659 --> 00:17:55.798
<i>We've been trying
to get people <i>
to understand that now</i></i>

243
00:17:55.833 --> 00:17:57.421
<i>for the last 30 years.</i>

244
00:17:57.455 --> 00:18:00.113
<i>But it's all immediately
wedded to</i>

245
00:18:00.148 --> 00:18:02.081
<i>this fact that they're
this horrible threat.</i>

246
00:18:02.115 --> 00:18:05.774
And so we have to
come forward with
a positive set of programs.

247
00:18:05.808 --> 00:18:07.638
a positive vision for this.

248
00:18:07.672 --> 00:18:10.227
and that's what I'm trying
to help get the Vatican
and the Jesuit order

249
00:18:10.261 --> 00:18:14.023
<i>to become involved in.
in putting forth <i>
a discussion</i></i>

250
00:18:14.058 --> 00:18:16.750
<i>about the theological
and philosophical challenges</i>

251
00:18:16.785 --> 00:18:19.960
that this presents to us.
but it's not
a national security threat.

252
00:18:21.134 --> 00:18:22.273
It's not a threat
to our species.

253
00:18:22.308 --> 00:18:23.654
It's not a threat
to our planet.

254
00:18:23.688 --> 00:18:25.794
<i>It's a threat to our view
as ourselves.</i>

255
00:18:25.828 --> 00:18:30.247
<i>as the be-all and end-all.
that the entire <i>
universe was created</i></i>

256
00:18:30.281 --> 00:18:34.182
<i>as a stage on which to play
out the human drama <i>
for one single species.</i></i>

257
00:18:35.183 --> 00:18:36.529
That ain't so.

258
00:18:36.563 --> 00:18:38.151
But let's get used to it.

259
00:18:38.186 --> 00:18:40.843
And let's figure out
what the new story is.

260
00:18:40.878 --> 00:18:42.259
<i>What is the new story?</i>

261
00:18:42.293 --> 00:18:44.778
<i>There's a positive story.
What is our role in it?</i>

262
00:18:44.813 --> 00:18:47.609
<i>We may not be
the star of it.</i>

263
00:18:47.643 --> 00:18:52.165
<i>but we're a good supporting
character in the unfolding <i>
of our universe.</i></i>

264
00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:54.650
<i>And let's figure out
what that story is.</i>

265
00:18:54.685 --> 00:18:57.964
The success of <i>Unacknowledged.
which has been seen by</i>

266
00:18:57.998 --> 00:18:59.690
hundreds of millions
of people now...

267
00:18:59.724 --> 00:19:01.209
Have you not
watched <i>Unacknowledged?</i>

268
00:19:01.243 --> 00:19:02.658
JOE ROGAN:
What is <i>Unacknowledged?</i>

269
00:19:02.693 --> 00:19:04.488
-You gotta
watch <i>Unacknowledged.
-What is that one?</i>

270
00:19:04.522 --> 00:19:07.180
-Okay. You gotta watch <i>
Unacknowledged.
-What is it?</i>

271
00:19:07.215 --> 00:19:08.871
You gotta watch <i>
Unacknowledged.</i>

272
00:19:08.906 --> 00:19:10.666
Is that that
Steven Greer movie?

273
00:19:10.701 --> 00:19:13.324
DR. GREER: <i>
It caused a reaction within
the intelligence community</i>

274
00:19:13.359 --> 00:19:17.708
<i>of the United States.
And so. what the major media <i>
has begun to do</i></i>

275
00:19:17.742 --> 00:19:21.194
<i>is to cooperate with
the intelligence community <i>
in reporting</i></i>

276
00:19:21.229 --> 00:19:22.885
<i>all this information out.</i>

277
00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:27.856
<i>but with this peculiar spin. very subliminal at this stage.</i>

278
00:19:27.890 --> 00:19:29.582
that it's a threat.

279
00:19:29.616 --> 00:19:31.998
NEWS ANCHOR: <i>
The project was called
the Advanced Aviation Threat</i>

280

<i>Identification Program.</i>

281
00:19:33.551 --> 00:19:36.071
<i>run by an official

282
00:19:36.105 --> 00:19:38.522
I think this is
a national security
imperative.

285
00:19:46.737 --> 00:19:49.118
One of my first cases.
coming out of law school.

286
00:19:49.602 --> 00:19:51.604
<i>was for NBC.</i>

287
00:19:51.638 --> 00:19:54.710
to establish the right of
journalists to protect their
confidential news sources.

288
00:19:54.745 --> 00:19:57.057
<i>I did the Amicus briefs for
The New York Times</i>

289
00:19:57.092 --> 00:19:58.507
<i>and</i>The Washington Post

290
00:19:58.542 --> 00:20:00.751
<i>and also for CBS and ABC.</i>

291
00:20:00.785 --> 00:20:03.236
<i>And it was at that time
that I began to realize</i>

292
00:20:03.271 --> 00:20:06.101
that there was
this close
working relationship

293
00:20:06.135 --> 00:20:08.345
between the board of editors
of <i>The New York Times</i>

294
00:20:08.379 --> 00:20:10.070
and the national security
community.

295
00:20:10.105 --> 00:20:12.245
<i>That there's conversations
going on all the time</i>

296
00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.421
<i>between the Board of
Editors and the national <i>
security people.</i></i>

297
00:20:15.455 --> 00:20:19.252
And we actually
got an affidavit
from Teddy Sorenson saying.

298
00:20:19.287 --> 00:20:23.291
<i>"Oh. yes. the National
Security State and CIA <i>

<i>"information about

that we're engaged in."</i></i>

301
00:20:30.263 --> 00:20:34.267
I was surprised
to find that out
at that point.

302
00:20:34.302 --> 00:20:36.545
<i>I began to do
an investigation about this.</i>

303
00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:40.066
<i>as a lawyer for
The Times and for NBC.</i>

304
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:44.588
<i>and found out that

307
00:20:52.147 --> 00:20:56.116
<i>and that they were deeply

308
00:20:56.151 --> 00:20:59.603
And they were constantly.
from their point of view.
safeguarding

309
00:20:59.637 --> 00:21:02.399
the information that was
going to be allowed
to get out.

310
00:21:02.433 --> 00:21:04.746
And it was quite clear
that they viewed themselves

311
00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.128
as all part of the same
basic fraternity.

312
00:21:08.163 --> 00:21:12.995
<i>They all shared in
the patriotic vision of <i>the Central Intelligence Agency</i></i>

313
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:14.514
<i>being able to
go around the world.</i>

314
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:16.689
<i>The biggest
challenge with them.</i>

315
00:21:16.723 --> 00:21:20.451
<i>the Pentagon Papers case.
is they didn't want to reveal <i>
the fact that there was</i></i>

316
00:21:20.486 --> 00:21:22.867
<i>a massive assassination
program going on.</i>

317
00:21:22.902 --> 00:21:25.698
<i>And it was being funded
by heroin trafficking.</i>

318
00:21:25.732 --> 00:21:29.702
<i>to keep it away from
the congressional <i>
funding investigations.</i></i>

319
00:21:29.736 --> 00:21:32.877
I thought this was

00:38:59.406 --> 00:39:05.722
Now. even say.
Bernie Sanders. hypothetically.
were to become president.

639
00:39:05.757 --> 00:39:09.381
The National Security State
isn't even going to tell him
where the washrooms are.

640
00:39:09.416 --> 00:39:13.074
That whole group is gonna
descend upon him

641
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:16.526
and they're gonna give him
at least as much trouble
as they've given Trump.

642
00:39:16.561 --> 00:39:19.184
If you got into the office

643
00:39:19.218 --> 00:39:22.670
and you found out
something about aliens.

644
00:39:22.705 --> 00:39:25.742
you found out something
about UFOs.
would you let us know?

645
00:39:25.777 --> 00:39:29.021
Well. I'll tell you.
my wife would demand
that I let you know.

646
00:39:29.056 --> 00:39:32.404
So that's why they want
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris
to come in

647
00:39:32.439 --> 00:39:35.580
and kind of get things
"back to normal."

648
00:39:35.614 --> 00:39:38.755
where the National Security
State is functioning.
They're all operational.

649
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:41.931
<i>They're all going to
brief Goldman Sachs.</i>

650
00:39:41.965 --> 00:39:44.968
<i>And they're putting people
from Goldman Sachs <i>
in charge of the economy.</i></i>

651
00:39:45.003 --> 00:39:46.625
That kind of thing.

652
00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:51.906
<i>We have to rise

<i>and have this function

655
00:39:58.188 --> 00:40:01.606
I mean.
we've got the tools here.
They're in front of us.

656
00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:03.573
And we've got access
to the Internet. still.

657
00:40:03.608 --> 00:40:05.230
They haven't taken that
away from us yet.

658
00:40:05.264 --> 00:40:07.819
But there's
a short window here.

<i>this 1% of the human family.</i>

683

685
00:41:55.478 --> 00:41:58.067
It is their world
that they're trying
to defend.

686
00:41:58.101 --> 00:42:02.071
<i>So that you see
that this is a subset <i>
of a larger question.</i></i>

687
00:42:02.105 --> 00:42:06.938
<i>about how spiritual
consciousness and <i>the evolution of consciousness</i></i>

688

689
00:42:11.943 --> 00:42:15.291
is a threat in itself
to this elite.

690
00:42:15.325 --> 00:42:18.052
<i>Because that is

691
00:42:18.087 --> 00:42:20.607

<i>of our proper place

694
00:42:25.957 --> 00:42:30.030
puts these people
out of business
as the ruling elite.

695
00:42:30.064 --> 00:42:35.587
And so that the raising of
consciousness of
our human family is so closely

696
00:42:35.622 --> 00:42:40.419
related on to the opening on to
the extraterrestrial experience.

697
00:42:40.454 --> 00:42:43.457
<i>that both of them together
are viewed as a threat</i>

698

<i>by the elite.</i>

699
00:42:45.079 --> 00:42:47.565
What they're afraid of
is that this is such
an accelerator

700
00:42:47.599 --> 00:42:51.292
<i>as people have these
repeated contacts <i>
with the extraterrestrials.</i></i>

701

702
00:42:53.432 --> 00:42:56.643
<i>They start becoming aware
of the fact that we're <i>
damaging our environment.</i></i>

703
00:42:56.677 --> 00:42:58.334
<i>They can become
aware of the fact</i>

704
00:42:58.368 --> 00:43:00.785
<i>that nuclear weapons
are kind of an insane thing <i>
to have.</i></i>

705
00:43:00.819 --> 00:43:02.890
<i>War is a really bad idea.</i>

706
00:43:02.925 --> 00:43:05.237
This is
a spiritual experience.

707
00:43:05.272 --> 00:43:08.896
It's a spiritual stimulation
that's coming.

708
00:43:08.931 --> 00:43:13.142
DR. GREER: <i>If you take someone from Italy and someone from Japan.</i>

709
00:43:13.176 --> 00:43:15.454
<i>very different cultures.
very different people.</i>

710
00:43:15.489 --> 00:43:17.664
<i>personalities. backgrounds.</i>

711
00:43:17.698 --> 00:43:21.184
and emotional temperament.
Now. extrapolate that out across

712
00:43:21.219 --> 00:43:25.085
the cosmos and think
of the vast differences
there are going to be.

713
00:43:25.119 --> 00:43:26.673
How do we make
any sense of that

714
00:43:26.707 --> 00:43:29.261
if we aren't anchored
into something deeper?

715
00:43:29.296 --> 00:43:33.024
And that point of commonality
has been folded within
each of us.

716
00:43:33.058 --> 00:43:35.682
And that is.
we are awake.
conscious beings.

717
00:43:35.716 --> 00:43:37.649
They are awake.
we are awake.

718
00:43:37.684 --> 00:43:41.619
That faculty of being
aware of awareness.
the consciousness.

719
00:43:41.653 --> 00:43:45.105
not what you're conscious of.
what it means to be awake.

720
00:43:45.139 --> 00:43:47.003
that is a singularity.

721
00:43:47.038 --> 00:43:49.834
And once we're anchored into
that state of consciousness.

722
00:43:49.868 --> 00:43:53.561
the unitive state.
then there aren't
any aliens.

723
00:43:53.596 --> 00:43:56.150
There are just
other people who are
a little different from us.

724
00:43:56.185 --> 00:44:00.327
This is the point where
we can make contact
most easily.

725
00:44:22.004 --> 00:44:24.696
<i>When I looked at
Close Encounters
of the Third Kind. I said.</i>

726
00:44:24.731 --> 00:44:28.217
"Well. somebody knows
what's going on here."

727
00:44:28.251 --> 00:44:32.980
<i>Because it had a lot to
do with telepathy. the sort <i>
of dreams people had</i></i>

728
00:44:33.015 --> 00:44:36.018
<i>that led them to
the Devil's Tower in Wyoming <i>
and all this.</i></i>

729
00:44:36.052 --> 00:44:39.331
And I then found out
that Spielberg had
actually had a man.

730
00:44:39.366 --> 00:44:42.887
<i>J. Allen Hynek.
who was the head <i>
of Project Blue Book</i></i>

731

who was <i>
the chief consultant.</i></i>

732
00:44:45.579 --> 00:44:48.893

733
00:44:48.927 --> 00:44:50.308

<i>How is this possible?</i>

742
00:45:26.482 --> 00:45:30.866
<i>It is not possible

<i>In order to make
sense of things.</i>

745
00:45:37.804 --> 00:45:41.083
<i>and indeed.
in order to <i>
make contact.</i></i>

746
00:45:41.117 --> 00:45:43.568
<i>we have to pause
and readdress</i>

747
00:45:43.602 --> 00:45:46.985
<i>our assumptions about
the very nature of reality.</i>

748
00:45:47.020 --> 00:45:50.955
<i>This is an essential reflection which reveals that the mystery</i>

749
00:45:50.989 --> 00:45:54.648
<i>of extraterrestrials
is but a sign post <i>
that points to</i></i>

750
00:45:54.682 --> 00:45:57.996
<i>a far more profound
and intimate secret.</i>

751
00:45:58.031 --> 00:46:03.001
<i>one with the power
to transform us and <i>
the cosmos forever.</i></i>

752
00:46:03.036 --> 00:46:05.763
One day. I opened my mailbox
and I got out a little flyer.

753
00:46:05.797 --> 00:46:09.007
and it said.
"We're inviting you to
a meeting with Ben Rich.

754
00:46:09.042 --> 00:46:11.596
<i>"the chairman and CEO
of Lockheed Skunk Works.</i>

755
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:14.012
<i>"former UCLA alumni.</i>

00:46:14.047 --> 00:46:16.325
<i>"He'll be speaking to

757
00:46:16.359 --> 00:46:18.845
<i>"about his time at
the Skunk Works."</i>

758
00:46:18.879 --> 00:46:22.469
So. as he was
finishing his talk
after about 45 minutes.

759
00:46:22.503 --> 00:46:25.817
his last slide
was a black disc.
zipping off into outer space.

760
00:46:25.852 --> 00:46:27.715
and he ended
the talk by saying.

761
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:30.857
"We now have the technology
to take ET home."

762
00:46:30.891 --> 00:46:32.859
And the whole room
burst out laughing.

763
00:46:32.893 --> 00:46:34.481
We said.
"Did he just say that?"

764
00:46:34.515 --> 00:46:36.966
And as he was
walking away.
I followed him.

765
00:46:37.001 --> 00:46:39.624
and I said. "Ben. Ben."
He turned around
and looked at me.

766
00:46:39.658 --> 00:46:43.214
and I said. "Ben. I'm really
fascinated with what you
had to say today."

767
00:46:43.248 --> 00:46:46.527
and I said.
"I would really love to know
how we would do that.

768
00:46:46.562 --> 00:46:49.358
"What would we use
to get to the stars?"

769
00:46:49.392 --> 00:46:52.050
He looked at me.
trying to figure out
who I was. I think.

770
00:46:52.085 --> 00:46:53.603
and he said.
"Let me ask you a question.

771
00:46:54.846 --> 00:46:56.503
"How does ESP work?"

772
00:46:56.537 --> 00:46:59.057
And I was really taken aback.
because I was asking
a question.

773
00:46:59.092 --> 00:47:00.818
I wasn't expecting
to get a question back.

774
00:47:00.852 --> 00:47:02.578
So the first thing
that popped
in my mind was.

775
00:47:02.612 --> 00:47:04.545
all points in space
and time are connected.

776
00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:05.857
So I fired that answer
back to him.

777
00:47:05.892 --> 00:47:07.686
"I don't know. All points
in space and time
are connected."

778
00:47:07.721 --> 00:47:08.964
He said.
"That's how it works."

779
00:47:08.998 --> 00:47:10.655
He turned around
and he walked away.

Essentially what

generator does.

897
00:53:57.268 --> 00:54:00.271
is it looks at something

it should.

up on the roof.</i></i>

953
00:57:18.607 --> 00:57:21.921
<i>The growing light can turn
in one of four quadrants.</i>

954
00:57:21.955 --> 00:57:25.925
<i>and which quadrant that light
is showing is controlled <i>
by a random number generator.</i></i>

955
00:57:25.959 --> 00:57:28.790
<i>So you put the plant
in one corner of the room.</i>

956
00:57:28.824 --> 00:57:32.794
<i>The light has
an equal chance of shining <i>
in all four quadrants.</i></i>

957
00:57:32.828 --> 00:57:35.175

960

<i>

965
00:57:52.538 --> 00:57:55.506
I see that experiment as
profound because
it shows to me

966
00:57:55.541 --> 00:57:57.715
what consciousness
does in the world.

967
00:57:57.750 --> 00:58:01.823
How could ESP work?
Does ESP violate
any physics?

968
00:58:01.857 --> 00:58:04.515
First of all.
you can't violate
the laws of physics.

969
00:58:04.550 --> 00:58:06.275
<i>It's not like going through
a stop sign.</i>

970
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:09.175
If you have a phenomenon.

971
00:58:09.209 --> 00:58:12.523
physics has to change to agree
with your phenomena.

972
00:58:12.558 --> 00:58:17.632
The biggest interest
in classified intelligence
projects

973
00:58:17.666 --> 00:58:20.186
has to do with
the science
of consciousness.

974

981
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:51.113
You can say
my spiritual development
was paid for by the CIA.

982
00:58:51.148 --> 00:58:53.564

a very unusual situation.

988
00:59:11.513 --> 00:59:14.102
We had a 20-year program

989
00:59:15.103 --> 00:59:18.244
in which we worked
with the CIA

990

999
01:00:10.054 --> 01:00:11.815
We didn't invent
remote viewing.

1000
01:00:11.849 --> 01:00:15.163
It was known
since Biblical times.

1001
01:00:15.197 --> 01:00:20.927

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:40.637
people would discover

1009
01:00:40.671 --> 01:00:43.709
that. yes. indeed.

our venture into this

1013
01:00:54.202 --> 01:00:57.861
<i>was a rediscovery

<i>of what people
had known and forgotten</i>

1015

1016
01:01:04.177 --> 01:01:08.561
NARRATOR: <i>Religious traditions
and the emerging <i>
scientific paradigm</i></i>

1017
01:01:08.595 --> 01:01:13.359
<i>are converging on this
personal experience of <i>
universal consciousness.</i></i>

1018
01:01:13.393 --> 01:01:16.224
<i>Dr. Greer first glimpsed
this reality</i>

1019
01:01:16.258 --> 01:01:20.159
<i>during a near-death experience when he was only 17 years old.</i>

1020
01:01:20.193 --> 01:01:23.714
You know. if you've died
and you know
there is no death.

1021
01:01:23.749 --> 01:01:25.716
then you have
no fear of it.

1022
01:01:25.751 --> 01:01:28.685
And until you have
no fear of death.
you really can't live.

1023
01:01:28.719 --> 01:01:32.378
I realize
that the consciousness
whereby I was awake.

1024
01:01:32.412 --> 01:01:34.587
that drop of
my individual awareness

1025
01:01:34.621 --> 01:01:39.074
<i>could merge with the ocean
of unbounded cosmic mind.</i>

1026
01:01:39.109 --> 01:01:43.630
So that experience taught me
that there's nothing
to be afraid of

1027
01:01:43.665 --> 01:01:46.185
and there's nowhere to go
'cause you're already there.

1028
01:01:46.219 --> 01:01:49.222
You just have to open
to what's already there
within you.

1029
01:01:49.257 --> 01:01:53.433
This liberated me
in a way that
I can't even imagine.

1030
01:01:53.468 --> 01:01:56.022
It is true liberation.

1031
01:01:56.057 --> 01:01:58.956
Now. you don't have to
drop dead like I did
to have that happen.

1032
01:01:58.991 --> 01:02:00.544
I think you can
experience that

1033
01:02:00.578 --> 01:02:03.202
through this
deeper experience
in meditation.

1034
01:02:03.236 --> 01:02:06.861
And that's why.
after I had that
near-death experience.

1035
01:02:06.895 --> 01:02:10.105
I thought. "How do I
get back to there
without being deathly ill?"

1036
01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:12.763
<i>And so I began to learn
how to do meditation.</i>

1037
01:02:12.798 --> 01:02:14.454
<i>'cause the whole universe
is actually</i>

1038
01:02:14.489 --> 01:02:16.940
<i>folded within every
single conscious being.</i>

1039
01:02:16.974 --> 01:02:19.287
<i>It's like
a quantum hologram.</i>

1044
01:02:30.367 --> 01:02:31.817
Everything.

[NARRATOR READING]

1051
01:02:59.499 --> 01:03:03.503
And so I began to be a student
of the ancient Vedas.

1052
01:03:03.538 --> 01:03:05.264
<i>What I learned was</i>

1053
01:03:05.298 --> 01:03:09.716

known as <i>siddhis.

go through solid objects.

1061
01:03:34.086 --> 01:03:37.675
These were all things
that develop spontaneously

1062

TARG: <i>
These were not considered

1065
01:03:47.237 --> 01:03:51.586
<i>These were considered

01:03:57.764 --> 01:03:59.905
And it's all available.

1069
01:03:59.939 --> 01:04:03.736
We have to participate
in consciously evolving

1070
01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:05.980
these faculties that we have

1071
01:04:06.014 --> 01:04:10.260

"What is our relationship
to these beings?"

1081
01:04:38.667 --> 01:04:42.223
<i>Why is it that they even look
as much as they do like us</i>

1088

1136
01:07:25.006 --> 01:07:26.456
Because humanism isn't enough

1137
01:07:26.490 --> 01:07:28.941
because we're dealing with
non-human life forms.

1138

Now we have to transcend
even humanism

into this idea

like a conscious
quantum hologram.

1151
01:08:05.322 --> 01:08:08.601
Because consciousness isn't
limited by space and time.

People say.
"Where do I have to go?"

1153
01:08:10.534 --> 01:08:12.398
Well. first. you have to
go within yourself.

1154
01:08:12.433 --> 01:08:14.642
But you have to understand
what "yourself" is.

1155
01:08:14.676 --> 01:08:17.093
And there's your
individual ego in self.

1156
01:08:17.127 --> 01:08:19.336
But there's
this deeper aspect
of ourselves

1157

that is
simultaneously interwoven.

deep in meditation
and connect to that.

1159

01:14:42.063 --> 01:14:45.066
but I wish for everybody
to have that opportunity.

1274
01:14:45.722 --> 01:14:47.068
[NARRATOR READING]

1275
01:14:54.213 --> 01:14:56.871
When I first started out.
it was shocking.

1276
01:14:56.906 --> 01:14:59.529
The first few orbs I saw.
the phenomena I saw

1277
01:14:59.564 --> 01:15:01.669
changed my
entire paradigm.

1278
01:15:01.704 --> 01:15:05.052
<i>The first sighting
was an incredible <i>
triangle formation</i></i>

1279
01:15:05.086 --> 01:15:07.917
<i>of three golden spheres
over my apartment</i>

1280
01:15:07.951 --> 01:15:09.505
<i>in Newport Beach. California.</i>

1281
01:15:09.539 --> 01:15:11.058
I ran outside

1282
01:15:11.092 --> 01:15:14.406
and saw this formation right
above my house at close range

1283
01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.650
<i>and I managed
to capture it on film.</i>

1284
01:15:16.684 --> 01:15:18.065
<i>As I put the lens on.</i>

1285
01:15:18.099 --> 01:15:20.861
<i>I saw they were
three perfect <i>
golden spheres.</i></i>

1286
01:15:20.895 --> 01:15:24.209
<i>all holding this incredible
formation over my apartment.</i>

1287
01:15:24.243 --> 01:15:25.555
The longer I filmed.

1288
01:15:25.590 --> 01:15:27.557
the more maneuvers
they demonstrated.

1289
01:15:27.592 --> 01:15:30.491
<i>And it was clear the objects
were under <i>
intelligent control.</i></i>

1290
01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:38.119
It was Christmas morning.
December 2016.

1291
01:15:38.154 --> 01:15:40.190
I was on my porch
having coffee

1292
01:15:40.225 --> 01:15:43.400
when I saw this incredible
double-staged orb

1293
01:15:43.435 --> 01:15:44.678
<i>flying through the air.</i>

1294
01:15:44.712 --> 01:15:46.749
<i>I was following
this object upward</i>

1295
01:15:46.783 --> 01:15:50.200
<i>and it went right up
like it was gonna pass out <i>
of my line of sight</i></i>

1296
01:15:50.235 --> 01:15:53.272
<i>when I asked the object.
"Please. turn back around."</i>

1297
01:15:53.307 --> 01:15:54.929
<i>I didn't want
the experience to end.</i>

1298
01:15:54.964 --> 01:15:56.586
<i>Amazingly. it stopped.</i>

1299
01:15:56.621 --> 01:15:59.313
<i>changed direction
and headed back downward.</i>

1300
01:15:59.347 --> 01:16:01.211
<i>That was truly profound
to me</i>

1301
01:16:01.246 --> 01:16:04.421
<i>that I could meditate.
send my thought <i>
into the universe.</i></i>

1302
01:16:04.456 --> 01:16:06.976
<i>and then have a visual
response in the sky</i>

1303
01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:10.220
<i>to confirm that we are
interacting with each other.</i>

1304
01:16:10.255 --> 01:16:12.809
That says something
about the nature of mind.

1305
01:16:12.844 --> 01:16:15.087
<i>the nature of
the phenomenon itself</i>

1306
01:16:15.122 --> 01:16:18.608
<i>and the power of
our own consciousness <i>
to interact.</i></i>

1307
01:16:21.369 --> 01:16:23.130
In October 2018.

1308
01:16:23.164 --> 01:16:26.582
we had the biggest sighting
I've seen yet
in Long Beach. California.

1309
01:16:26.616 --> 01:16:28.618
<i>My girlfriend and I were
in the backyard</i>

1310
01:16:28.653 --> 01:16:31.483
<i>when we saw this huge
white object in the sky.</i>

1311
01:16:31.517 --> 01:16:34.313
<i>This was different than
most of the normal orbs <i>
I have filmed.</i></i>

1312
01:16:34.348 --> 01:16:35.970
<i>This object was elongated</i>

1313
01:16:36.005 --> 01:16:39.008
<i>and almost looked
like a moving portal <i>
in the sky.</i></i>

1314
01:16:39.042 --> 01:16:41.424
<i>Amazingly. once I got
the camera on it.</i>

1315
01:16:41.458 --> 01:16:44.013
<i>and incredible triangle
formation of orbs</i>

1316
01:16:44.047 --> 01:16:46.084
<i>shot out of
this main object</i>

1317
01:16:46.118 --> 01:16:47.810
<i>and I captured it on film.</i>

1318
01:16:47.844 --> 01:16:51.296
<i>You can hear how excited
I am in the film to see <i>
this again.</i></i>

1319
01:16:51.330 --> 01:16:53.850
<i>this triangle formation
for the third time.</i>

1320
01:16:55.369 --> 01:16:57.854
Wow! What the fuck
is that thing?

1321
01:16:59.304 --> 01:17:00.685
Wow!

1322
01:17:03.308 --> 01:17:05.068
Holy shit.

1323
01:17:07.346 --> 01:17:10.660
Continued to film the object
as it traversed across the sky

1324
01:17:10.695 --> 01:17:12.662
<i>when suddenly
it started ejecting</i>

1325
01:17:12.697 --> 01:17:14.871
<i>a series of these
smaller orbs.</i>

1326
01:17:14.906 --> 01:17:17.563
<i>Fifty smaller objects
and counting.</i>

1327
01:17:17.598 --> 01:17:19.704
<i>Strangely. I could only see
the small orbs</i>

1328
01:17:19.738 --> 01:17:21.153
<i>on my infrared camera.</i>

1329
01:17:21.188 --> 01:17:23.535
<i>They were not visible
to the naked eye.</i>

1330
01:17:23.569 --> 01:17:26.158
<i>It goes to show you
how much is flying around <i>
in the sky</i></i>

1331
01:17:26.193 --> 01:17:27.539
<i>that we can't see.</i>

1332
01:17:35.098 --> 01:17:37.894
DR. GREER: <i>About six months
after I had <i>
the near-death experience.</i></i>

1333
01:17:37.929 --> 01:17:39.689
<i>and I began
learning meditation.</i>

1334
01:17:39.724 --> 01:17:42.485
<i>I was sitting up on a mountain up in North Carolina.</i>

1335
01:17:42.519 --> 01:17:44.349
And right before sunset.

1336
01:17:44.383 --> 01:17:46.178
I looked over
towards the southwest

1337
01:17:46.213 --> 01:17:50.010
<i>and I saw a beautiful
silver disc. seamless.</i>

1338
01:17:50.044 --> 01:17:51.736
<i>Close Encounter
of the First Kind.</i>

1339
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:54.704
It looked exactly
like the ET craft
I had seen

1340
01:17:54.739 --> 01:17:57.707
<i>when I was eight or nine
when I was a child <i>
in North Carolina.</i></i>

1341
01:17:57.742 --> 01:18:00.883
which actually ignited
my interest in all of this.

1342
01:18:00.917 --> 01:18:02.747
So. I said. "Oh. well.
They're back."

1343
01:18:02.781 --> 01:18:04.576
I didn't think
much more about it.

1344
01:18:04.610 --> 01:18:06.889
<i>So I sat to meditate
and I went to this <i>
very deep meditation.</i></i>

1345
01:18:06.923 --> 01:18:08.718
<i>By the time
I came out of <i>
the meditation.</i></i>

1346
01:18:08.753 --> 01:18:12.515
<i>it was very pitch dark
and there was the whole <i>
Milky Way galaxy.</i></i>

1347
01:18:12.549 --> 01:18:17.520
It was above my head.
and a thought
was sent in to me.

1348
01:18:17.554 --> 01:18:18.901
It was very clear.

1349
01:18:18.935 --> 01:18:22.525
It wasn't my random thought
or a hallucination at all.

1350
01:18:22.559 --> 01:18:25.770
And it said. "Behold.
what a beautiful universe
God has made."

1351
01:18:25.804 --> 01:18:29.739
<i>And with that. I went
right into the state <i>
of consciousness</i></i>

1352
01:18:29.774 --> 01:18:31.292
<i>that I was in
in the near-death experience.</i>

1353
01:18:31.327 --> 01:18:33.674
<i>except now I'm awake
and standing <i>
on the mountain.</i></i>

1354
01:18:34.744 --> 01:18:36.194
<i>And at that instant.</i>

1355
01:18:36.228 --> 01:18:39.438
I became aware
that there was
sort of a glow...

1356
01:18:39.473 --> 01:18:43.477
An energy field
right below the peak
and through the forest.

1357
01:18:43.511 --> 01:18:46.549
I thought it was a deer
standing on its hind legs.

1358
01:18:46.583 --> 01:18:49.241
And it had these
beautiful deer-like eyes.

1359
01:18:49.276 --> 01:18:52.313
And I went. "What is that
doing here?" You know.

1360
01:18:52.348 --> 01:18:53.867
And I realized
it wasn't a deer.

1361
01:18:53.901 --> 01:18:58.043
and it actually appeared
and then dematerialized.

1362
01:18:58.078 --> 01:19:00.390
came over and touched me
on the right shoulder.

1363
01:19:00.425 --> 01:19:02.392
But I could sense
its energy field

1364
01:19:02.427 --> 01:19:05.326
was still there.
It was phasing
in and out of 3D

1365
01:19:05.361 --> 01:19:10.331
and the near dimension
of astral energy.

1366
01:19:10.366 --> 01:19:13.127
And when it
touched my right shoulder.

1367
01:19:13.162 --> 01:19:15.785
I could actually see
my ski jacket indent.

1368
01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:19.789
And all my hair stood on end.
It was like this
electromagnetic pulse.

1369
01:19:19.824 --> 01:19:21.653
And I had long hair.
and it sort of... Ding!

1370
01:19:21.687 --> 01:19:23.068
At that instant.

1371
01:19:23.103 --> 01:19:25.795
<i>I vanished
off the mountain top <i>
on to the ship</i></i>

1372
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:29.488
<i>and then we were. bang.
almost instantly <i>
out in space.</i></i>

1373
01:19:29.523 --> 01:19:33.078
So. at that point. I stayed
in this meditative state

1374
01:19:33.113 --> 01:19:35.978
and was teaching
the ETs

1375
01:19:36.012 --> 01:19:39.015
what it was like to be
in that state
of consciousness

1376
01:19:39.050 --> 01:19:42.018
but also be a boy.
a young man.
on Earth.

1377
01:19:42.053 --> 01:19:44.158
They were very
interested in this.

1378
01:19:44.193 --> 01:19:48.300
And then we kinda merged
together in our meditation

1379
01:19:48.335 --> 01:19:53.512
and I created with them
this protocol for making
contact with them.

1380
01:19:55.031 --> 01:19:56.377
NARRATOR: <i>Two years later.</i>

1381
01:19:56.412 --> 01:19:59.656
<i>Dr. Greer attempted
to recreate the experience</i>

1382
01:19:59.691 --> 01:20:02.107
<i>during a meditation
teacher training course</i>

1383
01:20:02.142 --> 01:20:03.350
<i>in the French Alps.</i>

1384
01:20:03.384 --> 01:20:08.286
<i>resulting in the first mass
witness CE5.</i>

1385
01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:11.876
What we experienced in France
was really life-changing for me.

1386
01:20:11.910 --> 01:20:16.639
<i>It was the summer of 1975.
and that was the year <i>
we both turned 20.</i></i>

1387
01:20:16.673 --> 01:20:19.469
When we were
in teacher training.
it was very intensive.

1388
01:20:19.504 --> 01:20:21.540
<i>We were meditating.
doing yoga.</i>

1389
01:20:21.575 --> 01:20:25.303
<i>listening to endless tapes
of Maharishi.</i>

1390
01:20:25.337 --> 01:20:29.410
DR. GREER: <i>
So I did a deep meditation.
went into the state</i>

1391
01:20:29.445 --> 01:20:33.863
<i>and could sense
where in space <i>
these ET craft were.</i></i>

1392
01:20:33.898 --> 01:20:36.245
<i>connected to them.
introduced myself by name</i>

1393
01:20:36.279 --> 01:20:38.488
<i>and then vectored them
like you would vector a jet</i>

1394
01:20:38.523 --> 01:20:40.352
<i>into JFK Airport.</i>

1395
01:20:42.216 --> 01:20:45.185
All of a sudden.
right out of nowhere.

1396
01:20:45.219 --> 01:20:50.535
appeared a metallic. silent.
tetrahedron-shaped

1397
01:20:50.569 --> 01:20:52.709
<i>silver ship.</i>

1398
01:20:52.744 --> 01:20:54.435
It just appeared.

1399
01:20:54.470 --> 01:20:56.679
And I said.
"What is that. Steve?"

1400
01:20:56.713 --> 01:20:59.199
<i>There was no sound.</i>

1401
01:20:59.233 --> 01:21:02.202
And it was just
suspended in the air
and then gone.

1402
01:21:02.236 --> 01:21:03.859
<i>And it was just
the blue sky again.</i>

1403
01:21:04.929 --> 01:21:06.551
DR. GREER: <i>
It will happen</i>

1404
01:21:06.585 --> 01:21:09.761
<i>if you do it with just a pure
state of innocence about it.</i>

1405
01:21:09.795 --> 01:21:11.590
<i>And that's when I realized</i>

1406
01:21:11.625 --> 01:21:14.455
<i>that this can actually be done with groups of people.</i>

1407
01:21:14.490 --> 01:21:16.906
<i>And I just filed that away.</i>

1408
01:21:40.930 --> 01:21:45.935
NARRATOR: <i>In 1977. Dr. Greer

he says. <i>
"What did you do?"</i></i>

1426
01:23:06.498 --> 01:23:12.021

was the specificity <i>
of the vector.</i></i>

1427
01:23:12.056 --> 01:23:13.816

I was very specific.</i>

1428

1429
01:23:15.783 --> 01:23:17.820

of consciousness</i>

1462
01:25:06.549 --> 01:25:10.139

1463
01:25:10.174 --> 01:25:15.179
<i>There's a precise correlation
to the kind of technology</i>

1466

our own civilization.</i>

1467

<i>We're mostly
still separate people.</i>

1468

through a reductionist <i>
separate paradigm.</i></i>

1469
01:25:27.743 --> 01:25:30.194
<i>We're also still
very violent <i>
and destructive.</i></i>

1470
01:25:30.228 --> 01:25:31.885
So let's look at
our technologies.

1471
01:25:31.919 --> 01:25:35.060
<i>Oil. we're burning something
and destroying the air.</i>

<i>Nuclear power.</i>

1473
01:25:36.821 --> 01:25:39.617
<i>we're splitting and
tearing apart an atom <i>
to create heat.</i></i>

1474
01:25:39.651 --> 01:25:42.792
<i>to turn a turbine.
to create electricity.</i>

1475
01:25:42.827 --> 01:25:45.692
<i>Coal. we're digging stuff up
and destroying mountains</i>

1476
01:25:45.726 --> 01:25:48.902
<i>and then burning the stuff
in a fiery furnace.</i>

1477
01:25:48.936 --> 01:25:51.525
It's all very destructive.

1478
01:25:51.560 --> 01:25:53.872
And so our technologies

1479
01:25:53.907 --> 01:25:57.152

"How did my astral body

we are really on to something
with what we're doing.

1756

That we are
really making contact.

1757

in the whole story.

01:40:55.635 --> 01:40:57.361

1760
01:40:57.396 --> 01:41:00.537

it's mind-boggling. really.

1763
01:41:06.681 --> 01:41:08.062
Now. this is beautiful.

1764
01:41:08.096 --> 01:41:10.064
We were on the beach

That's it. They don't care

they don't care about...

1800

This is what
the Prince of

"You know. I have gone all over
the world where these UFOs

they're not around.
Maybe it's my attitude."

1804
01:42:48.403 --> 01:42:50.060
I said. "Bingo!"

1805
01:42:50.094 --> 01:42:52.994

1814
01:43:11.599 --> 01:43:12.910
<i>Before we had
broken the circle.</i>

1815
01:43:12.945 --> 01:43:15.223

1817

<i>about four feet tall.</i>

1819
01:43:20.918 --> 01:43:22.437
So that was an amazing shot.

1820
01:43:22.472 --> 01:43:24.198
What I began to understand

1821
01:43:24.232 --> 01:43:27.201
is that there's this whole
spectrum of phenomena

1825
01:43:35.554 --> 01:43:39.558
<i>For example. we have
electronic devices we'll have <i>
out. like a radar detector.</i></i>

1826

<i>magnetometers that pick up
the magnetic field shift.</i>

1827
01:43:42.768 --> 01:43:47.255
Those will all
start being activated
when a craft is approaching.

1828
01:43:47.290 --> 01:43:49.050
<i>And we're out
in the middle <i>
of the wilderness</i></i>

1829
01:43:49.084 --> 01:43:51.949
<i>where there's
no source of this <i>
electromagnetic radiation.</i></i>

1830
01:43:51.984 --> 01:43:55.781
<i>but they'll start communicating in a specific cadence</i>

1831
01:43:55.815 --> 01:43:57.714
<i>and a repeatable cadence.</i>

1832
01:43:57.748 --> 01:44:00.889
And I call this
transdimensional
electronic communication.

1833
01:44:00.924 --> 01:44:03.616
And they will actually
take over the circuitry

1834
01:44:03.651 --> 01:44:07.551
<i>of these electronic devices
we have out in the desert</i>

1835
01:44:07.586 --> 01:44:11.486
and begin to do
a specific communication.

1836
01:44:11.521 --> 01:44:13.419
Now. you have to decode it.

1837

And their
different civilizations

1838

1839
01:44:18.355 --> 01:44:23.084

The reason that
the deeper elements

1918

Consciousness Project.

1928
01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:17.102
A question tonight.
can you actually measure

1929
01:49:17.136 --> 01:49:19.725
the emotional outpouring
in a worldwide crisis?

1930
01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:22.314
Sometimes scientists think
that they have done just that.

1931
01:49:22.348 --> 01:49:25.041

found a bizarre pattern

1932

more peaceful.

1966
01:51:09.214 --> 01:51:11.147
more happy.
et cetera. and so on.

1967
01:51:11.181 --> 01:51:12.735
NARRATOR: <i>This was
actually based on</i>

1968
01:51:12.769 --> 01:51:14.564
<i>the studies done
in quantum physics</i>

1969
01:51:14.598 --> 01:51:16.497
<i>in which a container
of helium</i>

1970
01:51:16.531 --> 01:51:18.810
<i>was cooled down
to absolute zero.</i>

1971
01:51:18.844 --> 01:51:22.261
<i>When only 1%
of the helium became <i>
aligned to coherent.</i></i>

1972
01:51:22.296 --> 01:51:26.024
<i>the entire container
went through <i>
a phase transition.</i></i>

1973
01:51:26.058 --> 01:51:31.857
<i>instantly shifting into
coherence and taking on <i>
almost magical properties.</i></i>

1974
01:51:31.892 --> 01:51:35.274
<i>a state called super fluidity.</i>

1975
01:51:35.309 --> 01:51:39.934
So there was this transformation
at that 1% point.

1976
01:51:39.969 --> 01:51:42.040
When a critical
mass of people.

1977
01:51:42.074 --> 01:51:44.249
whether it's 1%
or a fraction of that

1978
01:51:44.283 --> 01:51:46.527
depends on the state
of consciousness

1979
01:51:46.561 --> 01:51:49.461
of those who are
practicing the meditation

1980
01:51:49.495 --> 01:51:52.015
or a prayer or coherence.

1981
01:51:52.050 --> 01:51:56.192
But at that point.
you can shift
an entire civilization.

1982
01:51:56.226 --> 01:51:58.125
If we all become coherent.

1983
01:51:58.159 --> 01:52:01.093

like a molecule of helium.

1984
01:52:01.128 --> 01:52:04.648
and we become aligned
and coherent and move
in the right direction.

1985
01:52:04.683 --> 01:52:08.066
it will transform
the other 99%.

1986
01:52:08.100 --> 01:52:09.964
even though they don't know
that we're doing it.

1987
01:52:09.999 --> 01:52:13.623
And that's the beauty
and the power
of the structure

1988
01:52:13.657 --> 01:52:16.039
of non-locality
in consciousness

1989
01:52:16.074 --> 01:52:18.145
is that it's all interwoven.

1990
01:52:18.179 --> 01:52:20.043
But there is enormous power

1991
01:52:20.078 --> 01:52:23.564
when you're operating
at that deeper level
of consciousness.

1992
01:52:23.598 --> 01:52:26.809
And that.
the intelligence community
is very much afraid of

1993
01:52:26.843 --> 01:52:30.088
because that's something.
A. they cannot control

1994
01:52:30.122 --> 01:52:35.093
and. B. it would
transcend their ability
to alter the outcome.
