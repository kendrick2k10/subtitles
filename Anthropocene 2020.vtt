3
00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.920
You know there is so much going on right now.

4
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:20.520
I'm surprised that the world is able to function in any way possible.

5
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.020
Function?

6
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.060
How can you call this functioning?

7
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.140
17 million people have died in the US.

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.760
In the last nine months.

9
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.540
Well. the governments are still trying to keep everything afloat.

10
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.340
Oh that's bullshit.

11
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.640
They're still vying for power. while people like you and me are trying to scrape our next meal together

12
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.700
Look. I get it.

13
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.000
But there is still hope!

14
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:43.780
In fact

15
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.640
A shipment of cans. fruits. vegetables. meats and it may be the last in the world...

16
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.920
From what I understand...

17
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.720
Is coming here!

18
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.760
And it will be here by the end of the month!

19
00:00:54.272 --> 00:00:54.784
Yeah

20
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.112
And you know how many people are going to die until then?

21
00:00:58.368 --> 00:00:59.648
Millions more.

22
00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:02.208
To everyone out there

23
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.280
Just try to stay alive

24
00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.600
The government has foresaken us

25
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.120
Fight

26
00:01:09.376 --> 00:01:10.144
Try to survive

27
00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:11.936
Conserve what little food you have

28
00:01:12.704 --> 00:01:14.240
This could be the end of humanity

29
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.020
Or the end of the world.

30
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.200
By 2019 planet Earth was home to 7.5 Billion people.

31
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.880
You can say that was the burden of 7 billion.

32
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.300
7 billion living organisms who established undisputed dominance

33
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.800
Over an entire planet.

34
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.680
Using and abusing. An apex predator.

35
00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.500
Unchallenged.

36
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.080
In the 1950s. the plant entered

37
00:02:01.344 --> 00:02:06.120
what many dub to be the last geological era:

38
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.488
The Anthropocene

39
00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.640
A man-made and controlled time.

40
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.140
We scorched the land before us.

41
00:02:14.144 --> 00:02:20.288
We killed off 80% of the species that would never walk the earth again.

42
00:02:20.544 --> 00:02:26.688
We killed each other. and we still spread like locusts.

43
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:33.080
And then the weather changed. with the weather went the land... and then the animals.

44
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.140
Food became scarce.

45
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.280
Water became polluted.

46
00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.880
The rapidly rising temperatures melted the ice caps.

47
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.940
Water levels raised dozens of feet.

48
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.080
Freakish storms littered the lands. here and there.

49
00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.720
Where it was cold. it became hot.

50
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.100
Where it was hot. it became cold.

51
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.160
Countries collapsed.

52
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.900
Mass famine ensued.

53
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.380
Some tried to stock the remaining supplies of food.

54
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.640
While others turned simply to cannibalism.

55
00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.060
Some. ended their lives.

56
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.800
Right when it all started.

57
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.180
(screaming)

58
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.080
(screaming)

59
00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.080
(sirens and gunfire)

60
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.600
I can't.

61
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.360
I can't.

62
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:38.540
You can!

63
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.560
Come on!

64
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.600
You have to get up!

65
00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.040
No. no! Please go! Just leave!

66
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.880
I'm not going to leave without you!

67
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.320
You have to get up. come on!

68
00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.060
Fuck!

69
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.520
Oh shit.

70
00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:04.100
Shit. Fuck.

71
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.060
You're going to be fine.

72
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.580
I can't do it. I can't.

73
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.060
Just a minute.

74
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.800
Just a minute. okay? Just a minute.

75
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.920
We've got to keep going.

76
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.240
Ah shit.

77
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.140
I wish we were in the woods.

78
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:28.720
Maybe we can hide.

79
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.540
You know. hold up somewhere.

80
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.900
We'll go to the woods and wait it out.

81
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.280
Just a little further.

82
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.840
I doubt there's any doctors left.

83
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.080
You never know.

84
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.560
Okay.

85
00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:00.980
Ah fuck.

86
00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:10.780
Just a little bit.

87
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.180
We have to save it.

88
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.240
We really got out.

89
00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.680
We sure did.

90
00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.820
I'm just glad we're doing this together.

91
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.200
This whole shit's fucking fucked.

92
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.720
But the fact that we're together.

93
00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.040
Gives me hope.

94
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.260
Just a little bit. but...

95
00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.600
I'm just glad it worked out.

96
00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:43.360
Me too.

97
00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.180
No!

98
00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:34.340
Sam!

99
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.420
Sam!

100
00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.180
No!

101
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:40.460
Stop!

102
00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:43.480
No!

103
00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:48.320
(screaming)

104
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.760
No! Stop!

105
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.080
(grunt)

106
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:10.220
Die!

107
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:43.920
Sam!

108
00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:48.920
(crying)

109
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.840
You still have to survive. Save people.

110
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.240
(sirens)

111
00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:18.300
(crying)

112
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:20.700
(gunfire)

113
00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:22.900
(laughing)

114
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.520
(crows)

115
00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.640
I caught her!

116
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:03.180
(struggling)

117
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:10.580
(music)

118
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.620
(music)

119
00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.100
(grunting. struggling)

120
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.020
God.

121
00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.960
Asshole. took her out of the cage. I bagged her up. The least you can do is fucking clean her.

122
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.460
The least you can do is let me have some fun with it.

123
00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:06.820
What I like best about the young ones they taste just like veal

124
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:27.640
Aye aye.

125
00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.360
Oh look what we have here.

126
00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:40.000
If you don't shut the fuck up. I'm going to let my dogs have a bite of you.

127
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:40.660
(groan)

128
00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:48.620
What a fuck!

129
00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.680
Get back here!

130
00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.400
(struggling)

131
00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:12.820
Fuck!

132
00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:18.100
Look at this piece of shit. Where the fuck were you?

133
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:21.680
I fucking hate Christmas.

134
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.560
Shut the fuck up. Fucking decorations.

135
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.040
(dog whining)

136
00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:17.160
(music)

137
00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:45.380
Hand over the bag.

138
00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:47.540
Now! Give it here!

139
00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:50.940
I ain't going to ask twice!

140
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:53.860
Give me the damn bag!

141
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.960
You've got goodies in there.

142
00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.400
Don't you. fuck!

143
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:01.080
I know you. I know you do!

144
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.160
You're always hoarding for yourself!

145
00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:07.300
Damn. You look good!

146
00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.140
Looks like I scored double today!

147
00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.880
No more fucking dead corpses for this guy!

148
00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.600
Sticking his dick in some cold. dead pussy!

149
00:24:21.220 --> 00:24:21.860
Damn fine

150
00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.760
Alright. We do this first.

151
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.520
There better be some goodies in that bag.

152
00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:33.240
Deal?

153
00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.220
Now. I don't want you squirming and shit!

154
00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:39.060
You don't do anything to my dick.

155
00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.820
You bite it. I'll break your fucking jaw!

156
00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.540
(groan)

157
00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.720
(gagging on blood)

158
00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:13.820

(coughing)

166
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.920
No. No. Nothing I can do. No.

167
00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:44.780
Nothing. No.

168
00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.720
No. Not my fault!

169
00:29:47.460 --> 00:29:48.980
It's not my fault. No!

170
00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:55.520
No. No! No.

171
00:29:56.780 --> 00:29:58.220
No. Get out of my head!

172
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:02.500
No. It's not my fault.

173
00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.380
No. No. No!

174
00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:42.180

(laughing)

177
00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.240
It isn't my fault.

178

187
00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:36.320
(breaths heavy)

188
00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:40.460
Ugh.

189
00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:49.560
(music)

190
00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.580
Water.

191
00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.220
Do you have water?

192
00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.120
Thank you.

193
00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.520
Where you headed?

194
00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:31.820
You should come with me.

195
00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.240
Look what happened.

196
00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:40.380
It's not safe for a woman by herself. we should stick together.

197
00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.040
Oh son of a fucknut.

198
00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:12.580
We're going to get through this. okay.

199
00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:15.280
Here's the road.Let's go.

200
00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:18.500
Can you do that?

201
00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:19.520
Yeah. I'm good.

202
00:39:19.600 --> 00:39:20.480
Are you sure?

203
00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.000
You're not good.

204
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.900
Babe. you see that right there?

205
00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.840
We can make it to that mound.

206
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.480
Are you good?

207
00:39:29.580 --> 00:39:31.340
Its alright. Its alright.

208
00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.540
A few more steps

209
00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:40.280
Hold on. Hold on.

210
00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:41.440
Almost. Almost.

211
00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.520
You need to sit all the way down.

212
00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:47.320
I got you.

213
00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:50.300
Breathe.

214
00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:51.780
I'm going to take my mask off.

215
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.080
Just rest for a sec.

216
00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.180
Okay?

217
00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:00.340
Are you good?

218
00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.180
Take some breaths.

219
00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:05.500
Breathe for me.

220
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:10.380
Its hot.

221
00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:14.300
Oh look! A bottle.

222
00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.460
Just for you.

223
00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:16.960
I love you.

224
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:18.820
I love you too.

225
00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.640
Drink all of it.

226
00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:23.640
I'm glad we found it.

227
00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:30.020
We going to be there today. I promise.

228
00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.160
Okay. ready?

229
00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:38.920
Did that help?

230
00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:40.140
That's better.

231
00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.640
See that road? That means some sort of civilization that was there once.

232
00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.420
There's probably a building.

233
00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.100
I don't even know.

234
00:40:52.100 --> 00:40:53.240
I'm going to go check it out.

235
00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.460
I'll be less than 30 minutes. I promise.

236
00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:56.660
Please be safe.

237
00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.060
I will be safe. I promise.

238
00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:02.040
Keep this in your bag

239
00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.280
Keep your eyes open.

240
00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:04.500
Stay breathing

241
00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:06.200
I will.

242
00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:07.420
Be safe.

243
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.360
Come back.

244
00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:16.860
Hey.

245
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.360
Did you forget something?

246
00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.880
What did I forget?

247
00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.360
Who are you?

248
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:48.020
(gagging on water)

249
00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:14.240
(music)

250
00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.040
(music continues)

251
00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.200
(music intensifies)

252
00:46:19.160 --> 00:46:20.440
Please stop

253
00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:33.460
That won't be necessary. It's just me here.

254
00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:46.260
Hey. why don't you sit down. All right?

255
00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:47.820
Take a break.

256
00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:52.660
Relax. you don't look too well

257
00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:54.480
Okay?

258
00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:18.260
Names John. Not that it matters much.

259
00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:24.660
A name is what? I mean it's all we really have. isn't it?

260
00:47:25.460 --> 00:47:27.020
Kind of sad.

261
00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:49.200
So. um...

262
00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.820
Where were you heading?

263
00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.840
Where are you going?

264
00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:57.980
I mean.

265
00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:02.040
You're welcome to stay here.

266
00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.320
Rest up a while.

267
00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:04.980
You know.

268
00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.580
Get a little energy back.

269
00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:22.300
Water

270
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.060
It's not much.

271
00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:33.540
That's pretty much all I've got for you. kid.

272
00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:35.880
But you're welcome to it.

273
00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:43.940
Woah. woah. woah. Easy there.

274
00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:47.080
You might want to conserve that.

275
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:51.520
Take it easy with that. at least until you get some more.

276
00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:54.180
I'll find more.

277
00:48:56.440 --> 00:48:57.340
Where?

278
00:48:58.120 --> 00:48:59.960
All the creeks are dried up.

279
00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:03.920
There's no water around.

280
00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.240
Unless you make it to the lake.

281
00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.180
I'm not going to lie to you.

282
00:49:14.320 --> 00:49:16.300
There's cannibals.

283
00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:18.340
Cannibals everywhere.

284
00:49:19.020 --> 00:49:20.700
And they won't hesitate.

285
00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:30.200
Why don't you rest up a bit. you know?

286
00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:36.680
Get comfortable and gather your strength.

287
00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.140
You'll need it. kid.

288
00:49:38.460 --> 00:49:39.820
It's Hell out there.

289
00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:32.960
(music)

290
00:51:07.440 --> 00:51:08.660
Jesus kid

291
00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:11.520
You know you talk a lot in your sleep.

292
00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:13.100
Nightmares?

293
00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:27.860
Why don't you come with me we can find water together.

294
00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:34.260
You know. I really appreciate that. kid. But...

295
00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:40.660
I buried two of my own back there. My wife and my kid.

296
00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.680
I'll be goddamned if I'm going to leave them.

297
00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:46.700
It's all I have.

298
00:51:47.860 --> 00:51:49.580
I appreciate it. though.

299
00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:54.260
Thanks for the water.

300
00:51:57.820 --> 00:51:58.580
Good luck. kid.

301
00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:00.120
Be careful out there

302
00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:13.160
(music)

303
00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:22.900
I'm sorry. I... I didn't mean that.

304
00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:29.040
I'd never leave you two. I mean...

305
00:52:29.823 --> 00:52:32.895
We have it good here. I mean...

306
00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.100
It's our own little place. you know?

307
00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.920
She could have stayed if she wanted to.

308
00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:42.180
I'm not going to let her go.

309
00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.200
We know what's out there. don't we?

310
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:49.280
We know what's out there. don't we.

311
00:52:50.040 --> 00:52:51.580
Very dangerous.

312
00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:53.920
Very bad

313
00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:11.200
(laughing)

314
00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.560
(coughing)

315
00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.460
(laughing)

316
00:53:31.620 --> 00:53:33.060
You want to pass?

317
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:39.200
You need to give me the water. Give me. Give me! Give me the water!

318
00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:42.960
You no pass. Give me the water!

319
00:53:43.560 --> 00:53:45.080
I don't have anything.

320
00:53:45.860 --> 00:53:48.700
I don't have anything. I'm trying to find water too.

321
00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:50.420
I don't have any water.

322
00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:51.880
I'm sorry.

323
00:54:00.220 --> 00:54:01.020
(coughing)

324
00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:07.380

Ah!

338

339
01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:07.340

This virus!

375
01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.980
It's killing everyone!

376
01:08:21.380 --> 01:08:22.140
Changing us

377
01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.720
Full cycle. Full cycle.

378
01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.340
Full cycle. Full cycle.

379
01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.480
Full cycle.

380
01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:30.880
Ice Age. Dinosaurs. Full cycle!

381
01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:32.640
Full cycle!

382
01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.060
Fuck!

383
01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.940
Virus! Virus. Virus. Virus!

384
01:08:39.260 --> 01:08:40.020
Killing us all.

385
01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:41.400
Taking our children.

386
01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:42.220
Fuck!

387
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:43.900
Fuck!

388
01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:45.820
Cycle. Full cycle!

389
01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:47.360
Fuck!

390
01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:53.460
(painful whimpers)

391
01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.000
No.

392
01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:13.140
No. no. no. no. no. no. no.

393
01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:15.420
It's okay!

394
01:09:16.160 --> 01:09:17.920
We're fine.

395
01:09:18.300 --> 01:09:20.540
Nature is getting back to itself.

396
01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:21.820
We're all okay.

397
01:09:25.820 --> 01:09:26.620
We're okay.

398
01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:34.320
So thirsty.

399
01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.120
Fuck!

400
01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:40.240
I've got to find her.

401
01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:03.540
She has the water.

402
01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.540
She's around here somewhere.

403
01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:10.180
(laughing)

404
01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.080
(laughing maniacally)

405
01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:18.540
I'm going to get you!

406
01:10:21.220 --> 01:10:23.460
And I'm going to steal your water!

407
01:11:08.680 --> 01:11:10.120
(whimpering in pain)

408
01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:48.460
(music)

409
01:12:50.340 --> 01:12:50.980
(coughs)

410
01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.240
I'm so weak.

411
01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:00.440
(coughs)

412
01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:05.480

413
01:14:31.220 --> 01:14:33.040
(urinating)

414
01:14:49.180 --> 01:14:49.900
(gagging)

415
01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:48.020
(vomits)

416
01:15:58.260 --> 01:15:59.060
(laughing)

417
01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:01.800
I've got you now!

418
01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:04.620
I've got you now!

419
01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.080
(coughs)

420
01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:25.720
(laughs)

421
01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:49.080
(whine. groans)

422
01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:54.480
(music intensifies)

423
01:17:09.940 --> 01:17:11.060
(groans in pain)

424
01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:08.960

425
01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:15.620
(music continues)
