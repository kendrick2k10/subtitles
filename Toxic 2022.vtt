00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:31.666
I asked you for your guidance.

4
00:00:34.708 --> 00:00:36.708
I asked you for your love

5
00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:39.833
and comfort. I am here as your child

6
00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:42.208
asking you for mercey.

7
00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:46.250
Shine on my path.

8
00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:48.958
Shine on this day.

9
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:53.083
I continued to humble myself and

10
00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:58.125
and asked you to shine on those times
that I’ve been toxic.

11
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.208
shine on those times
that I’ve been toxic.

12
00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:06.166
shine on those times
that I’ve been toxic.

13
00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:10.541
I am a new man.

14
00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.291
In Jesus name.

15
00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:15.666
Amen.

18
00:01:49.375 --> 00:01:50.541
Hello?

19
00:01:52.916 --> 00:01:54.125
You're a murderer

20
00:01:54.125 --> 00:01:55.041
Jeffrey

21
00:01:55.041 --> 00:01:56.125
who takes lives.

22
00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:58.000
You don't create them.

23
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.750
How did I get here?

24
00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:11.125
I don't remember walking in here.

25
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.500
You go and fuck my best friend
Billy and start your whole new life.

26
00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.750
And I have nothing.

27
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.000
Still blaming everyone else

28
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.875
for your own shit.

29
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.458
I get what I like.

30
00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.375
And I like your wife.

31
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.916
Going to do something about it. Jeffrey?

32
00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:38.375
I am the one who is responsible

33
00:02:38.375 --> 00:02:40.875
for your wife's adultery.

34
00:02:41.625 --> 00:02:44.375
[laughing]

35
00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:48.125
I'm married to a man

36
00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:49.875
that makes me happier than you ever could.

37
00:02:52.166 --> 00:02:53.000
You're going to do something

38
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.625
about a little bird?

39
00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.875
A kiss that I love dearly.

40
00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:04.333
I don't want to
someone like you around my kids.

41
00:03:05.416 --> 00:03:07.416
I ended all those lives to keep me.

42
00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.666
To be true to who I am.

43
00:03:14.125 --> 00:03:16.166
You took everything from me.

44
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:27.583
[laying down]

45
00:03:32.125 --> 00:03:35.041
Your mind is glitching.

46
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.416
Your mind is glitching.

47
00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:42.791
Your mind is glitching.

52
00:04:01.625 --> 00:04:03.541
Hey. Ricardo.

53
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.375
Didn't you say you were going to be here
at three?

54
00:04:06.375 --> 00:04:07.500
I'm here.

55
00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.791
No. I'm not paying extra because your system

56
00:04:12.791 --> 00:04:13.666
no show.

57
00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:18.916
What? No. that's kinda disrescpectful.

58
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Okay.

59
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.125
All right.

60
00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:27.625
Well. I'll see you at three.

61
00:04:28.833 --> 00:04:29.833
Okay. Bye.

62
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:39.375
Jeffrey?

63
00:04:40.625 --> 00:04:41.041
Jeffrey?

64
00:04:41.125 --> 00:04:42.625
What are you doing here?

65
00:04:46.041 --> 00:04:47.625
How'd you get in?

66
00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:51.000
The door was open.

67
00:04:53.375 --> 00:04:55.916
But you're not supposed to be here.

68
00:04:58.875 --> 00:04:59.375
Jeffrey.

69
00:04:59.375 --> 00:05:01.250
You're not supposed to be here.

70
00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.625
I came to see you.

71
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.625
Okay.

72
00:05:05.625 --> 00:05:07.333
I'll call the cops to get you out of here.

73
00:05:12.541 --> 00:05:13.666
Come on.

74
00:05:20.125 --> 00:05:21.083
Are you okay?

75
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:24.750
You kinda look like
you haven't eaten for a while.

76
00:05:25.416 --> 00:05:26.458
I haven’t.

77
00:05:30.166 --> 00:05:31.125
Okay.

78
00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:33.666
Stay here for.

79
00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.500
I'll be right back.

80
00:05:34.916 --> 00:05:36.208
[walking away]

81
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.541
[door opening]

82
00:05:58.916 --> 00:06:00.208
[door closing]

83
00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:07.750
Here you go.

84
00:06:09.125 --> 00:06:11.291
It’s your favorite popcorn.

85
00:06:17.041 --> 00:06:18.416
[eating sound]

86
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:22.375
Why are you really here?

87
00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:29.000
I just came to see how things were.

88
00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:33.041
Are things the way you expected?

89
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.625
Not exactly how

90
00:06:36.625 --> 00:06:38.500
I remember it. but.

91
00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:41.208
It’s okay.

92
00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:41.833
It’s okay.

93
00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.500
Did you expect to see me here?

94
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:49.375
[eating sound]

95
00:06:49.375 --> 00:06:50.166
What?

96
00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:53.875
How did you expect to see me here

97
00:06:53.875 --> 00:06:55.625
when I don't live here?

98
00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.916
Because this is our house.

99
00:07:01.416 --> 00:07:03.625
No. Jeffrey. this was our house.

100
00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:06.541
It’s not anymore.

101
00:07:08.875 --> 00:07:11.791
Because you left and you took everything.

102
00:07:11.791 --> 00:07:13.583
So I had to start over.

103
00:07:16.166 --> 00:07:17.458
I took everything?

104
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:19.750
Yeah.

105
00:07:20.166 --> 00:07:23.500
You're the one who decided to start
your new life with my best friend Billy.

106
00:07:24.541 --> 00:07:26.166
What was I suppose to do there?

107
00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:28.875
Sit here and let my wife get her back
blown up by another man?

108
00:07:29.625 --> 00:07:30.125
Okay.

109
00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:32.750
You don't have to be so vulgar.

110
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:34.333
You took everything from me.

111
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.666
No.

112
00:07:35.666 --> 00:07:37.416
I did not do that.

113
00:07:37.416 --> 00:07:38.333
This state did that.

114
00:07:38.333 --> 00:07:41.166
No. you took my money. my career.

115
00:07:41.416 --> 00:07:44.625
my house. my money. my car.

116
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.458
I live on the streets now.

117
00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:47.750
Okay.

118
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.750
Guess we weren’t a good match then.

119
00:07:55.166 --> 00:07:57.791
You were always too controlling. Jeffrey.

120
00:07:59.375 --> 00:08:01.375
I felt like I couldn't breathe around you.

121
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:06.000
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.500
It's hard to hear.

123
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.750
You know what?

124
00:08:10.125 --> 00:08:11.291
It's the truth.

125
00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:13.625
And I think that

126
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.875
if you if you learn from this.
if you move on.

127
00:08:17.416 --> 00:08:19.750
the next person
that you'll end up with will

128
00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.583
definitely benefit from a changed you.

129
00:08:25.375 --> 00:08:27.750
Do you think somebody would want me?

130
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.625
I don’t know.

131
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.916
Look at me. Penelope.

132
00:08:33.916 --> 00:08:35.041
I'm homeless.

133
00:08:35.041 --> 00:08:37.000
I haven’t taken a shower in weeks.

134
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.375
I'm ugly. I'm dirty.

135
00:08:39.375 --> 00:08:42.291
No. you're not ugly and dirty.

136
00:08:42.541 --> 00:08:44.625
You could definitely
clean up a little bit. but

137
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.625
hey. I married a handsome man.

138
00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:50.416
and now he's

139
00:08:50.416 --> 00:08:51.666
he’s still you.

140
00:08:55.708 --> 00:08:56.375
Okay.

141
00:08:58.375 --> 00:08:59.666
What about you?

142
00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:02.375
Are you happy?

143
00:09:02.916 --> 00:09:05.166
Yeah. I am.

144
00:09:07.791 --> 00:09:10.083
I am happy with Billy.

145
00:09:11.041 --> 00:09:13.291
And my two kids and a dog.

146
00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:14.750
You don't even like dogs.

147
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.791
How do you know?

148
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:20.916
All right.

149
00:09:20.916 --> 00:09:23.250
Well. it was good seeing you. Jeffrey.

150
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:25.750
Uh. should I walk you out?

151
00:09:32.375 --> 00:09:34.166
Penelope?

152
00:09:34.833 --> 00:09:35.458
Mm?

153
00:09:37.250 --> 00:09:38.416
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.083
I'm sorry for everything.

155
00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:47.083
Why are you just now saying I’m sorry?

156
00:09:49.125 --> 00:09:50.250
Because I'm

157
00:09:50.291 --> 00:09:52.000
I'm alone and I don't have anything.

158
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:56.250
And I never thought
It would feel like this.

159
00:09:57.541 --> 00:09:59.250
You know. and I wish.

160
00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:01.500
I wish to God I could fix it.

161
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.666
Me too.

162
00:10:03.625 --> 00:10:06.000
You need to see a therapist or something.

163
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.750
Because this is pathetic.

164
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:12.250
How am I supposed to get help
when I have nothing to get to help with?

165
00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:14.125
Find a solution. Jeffrey.

166
00:10:15.125 --> 00:10:16.375
There's always a solution.

167
00:10:16.375 --> 00:10:18.750
That's easy for you to say
when you're at the top of a hill.

168
00:10:19.041 --> 00:10:20.041
Okay.

169
00:10:20.375 --> 00:10:22.291
It's not always easy.

170
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:24.250
Thank you very much.

171
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.666
You just have to find.

172
00:10:25.666 --> 00:10:27.000
Think.

173
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Think of something.

174
00:10:28.625 --> 00:10:29.166
Come.

175
00:10:58.875 --> 00:11:00.541
What are you thinking?

176
00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:04.750
I'm wondering why you don't
ever think about me.

177
00:11:05.125 --> 00:11:06.500
Do you ever think about me?

178
00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.500
I mean I do. sometimes.

179
00:11:12.666 --> 00:11:14.000
Like when I have to sing

180
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.041
one of the songs we
wrote together.

181
00:11:17.125 --> 00:11:19.791
If I see something
that remind me of you.

182
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:23.666
Why?

183
00:11:24.791 --> 00:11:26.375
Do you think about me?

184
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:31.500
It's hard to think about anything
with all this

185
00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:34.000
goddamn gardening going on outside.

186
00:11:34.083 --> 00:11:35.833
[laughing]

187
00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:37.166
Okay.

188
00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.375
But yeah.

189
00:11:42.916 --> 00:11:44.875
I think about you all the time.

190
00:11:45.625 --> 00:11:47.250
I think about us.

191
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.500
I think about

192
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.000
the past.

193
00:11:52.250 --> 00:11:54.125
I think about us before I got so evil.

194
00:11:54.125 --> 00:11:55.125
Before got so dark.

195
00:11:57.291 --> 00:11:59.375
And whose fault is it getting so dark?

196
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.041
Why do you think I'm living ike this?

197
00:12:01.041 --> 00:12:02.291
I don't know.

198
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:04.458
You think I like living like this?

199
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.916
I'm living like this because of you.

200
00:12:08.916 --> 00:12:10.916
Because of the divorce.
You let it ruin me.

201
00:12:10.916 --> 00:12:12.000
Okay. this is what we're doing?

202
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.125
Yea. this is exactly
what we're doing.

203
00:12:14.125 --> 00:12:17.625
You go and fuck my best friend
Billy and start your whole new life.

204
00:12:17.875 --> 00:12:19.250
And you leave me with nothing.

205
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.625
You forgot the man that you loved.
that you said you loved.

206
00:12:22.125 --> 00:12:24.333
Now I'm not even a shell of the man
I used to be.

207
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:26.375
Okay.

208
00:12:26.916 --> 00:12:29.250
Still haven't changed much. I see.

209
00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:32.500
Still blaming everyone else
for your own shit.

210
00:12:33.416 --> 00:12:34.208
Yeah.

211
00:12:34.416 --> 00:12:35.375
Yeah.

212
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:36.625
Yeah.

213
00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:38.833
I haven't changed much.
but I guess you did.

214
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.416
You changed a lot. Penelope.

215
00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.416
into this cold hearted.
rotten bitch.

216
00:12:48.375 --> 00:12:52.333
My heart is as cold as
the ocean flor.

217
00:12:55.541 --> 00:12:57.166
Can you not look at me like that?

218
00:12:57.166 --> 00:12:58.875
You know it's true.

219
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.166
You know.

220
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:05.000
I never asked you something
I always wanted to ask you.

221
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.875
So.

222
00:13:06.875 --> 00:13:08.541
Now seems like a good time.

223
00:13:10.416 --> 00:13:11.000
Okay?

224
00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:15.250
Why are you the way you are?

225
00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:18.500
What?

226
00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:19.541
Like

227
00:13:19.541 --> 00:13:20.500
cold.

228
00:13:20.958 --> 00:13:22.000
Hearthless.

229
00:13:22.625 --> 00:13:23.291
Like

230
00:13:23.375 --> 00:13:24.041
Like

231
00:13:24.541 --> 00:13:27.166
a deserted radiation

232
00:13:27.166 --> 00:13:31.000
nuclear facility in the coldest
parts of Russia in the winter. Why?

233
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.750
What. something happened
to you as a kid?

234
00:13:34.125 --> 00:13:36.875
You saw something growing up to
traumatize you. what happened?

235
00:13:40.916 --> 00:13:42.791
Do you really want to know?

236
00:13:42.791 --> 00:13:43.625
Yeah.

237
00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:50.166
Kind of.

238
00:13:52.125 --> 00:13:55.208
It's kind of hard for the
soul to listen to.

239
00:13:55.208 --> 00:13:56.833
I want. I really want to know.

240
00:14:00.125 --> 00:14:00.750
Okay.

241
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:04.375
Well.

242
00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:10.500
When I was a child.

243
00:14:12.375 --> 00:14:14.208
I was touched

244
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.875
by

245
00:14:17.375 --> 00:14:18.500
m ultiple

246
00:14:18.916 --> 00:14:21.375
men in my family.

247
00:14:24.416 --> 00:14:27.250
My parents both knew.

248
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:30.000
And I thought that

249
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.250
they would just let it go
on forever.

250
00:14:33.916 --> 00:14:37.708
Until one day they died.
both of them

251
00:14:38.791 --> 00:14:40.375
in a car crash.

252
00:14:42.541 --> 00:14:44.291
So. it was just my sister

253
00:14:44.291 --> 00:14:46.916
and I left and.

254
00:14:48.291 --> 00:14:49.291
We were very close.

255
00:14:49.291 --> 00:14:50.875
We were best friends.

256
00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:55.458
Well. we were both.

257
00:14:55.458 --> 00:14:57.125
we were both touched by

258
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.166
these males.

259
00:15:04.166 --> 00:15:06.375
And then one day.
my sister died of cancer.

260
00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:11.000
So it's just me.

261
00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:15.500
It's just me alone.

262
00:15:17.625 --> 00:15:20.250
And I think after that

263
00:15:20.375 --> 00:15:23.000
probably just shut off. I guess.

264
00:15:24.875 --> 00:15:27.125
I mean the touching. I don't.
I don't care anymore.

265
00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:28.875
I didn't feel anything.

266
00:15:30.625 --> 00:15:33.500
And I didn't feel happy.

267
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.125
Basically. I didn't feel any emotion.

268
00:15:45.916 --> 00:15:48.166
But of course you remember.

269
00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:52.791
Cause you never really make me happy

270
00:15:53.416 --> 00:15:55.375
and satisfied me.

271
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.375
Do you remember when we first met?

272
00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:03.291
Really?

273
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:05.250
Do you remember?

274
00:16:05.375 --> 00:16:06.666
Of course.

275
00:16:10.125 --> 00:16:13.041
I was burying a man alive.

276
00:16:14.041 --> 00:16:16.541
And you pretended to think it was fake.

277
00:16:17.916 --> 00:16:21.000
And instead of leaving.
you stood there and you took pictures.

278
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.750
You are sick and twisted. Penelope.

279
00:16:23.875 --> 00:16:26.541
No. You get off on the pain of others.

280
00:16:26.750 --> 00:16:29.375
No. I don't get all on it.

281
00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:33.041
I just fascinated is all.

282
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.916
I’m seriously.

283
00:16:34.916 --> 00:16:38.750
I'm fascinated when a man
like you can act

284
00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:40.916
like a zoo animal.

285
00:16:43.291 --> 00:16:44.375
You're a monster.

286
00:16:44.375 --> 00:16:47.791
Oh. And what does that make you?

287
00:16:47.916 --> 00:16:50.791
Because I was young and stupid.
but I'm more mature now.

288
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Are you? Yes.

289
00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.041
I think you're still the same rotten
Penelope

290
00:16:56.333 --> 00:16:58.208
that you were as a little girl.

291
00:16:59.916 --> 00:17:01.208
I was rotten

292
00:17:02.041 --> 00:17:03.041
because I wanted

293
00:17:03.041 --> 00:17:05.916
to see a man bury another
man alive? Yes.

294
00:17:06.833 --> 00:17:09.708
See. some bad habits die hard.

295
00:17:10.708 --> 00:17:13.041
And some bad habits don't
die until we die

296
00:17:13.041 --> 00:17:14.041
with them.

297
00:17:15.083 --> 00:17:16.416
[laughing]

298
00:17:17.291 --> 00:17:20.333
You sound like a crazy homeless person
right now.

299
00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:24.166
Why are you here?

300
00:17:25.291 --> 00:17:28.041
Because I have to
renovate the property.

301
00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:31.875
I'm going to sell it.

302
00:17:31.875 --> 00:17:32.750
Why?

303
00:17:33.333 --> 00:17:34.333
Because I need the money.

304
00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:35.708
Bullshit.

305
00:17:36.541 --> 00:17:38.416
You took all my money.

306
00:17:38.416 --> 00:17:39.666
You don't need any more money.

307
00:17:39.666 --> 00:17:41.666
Why are you really here?

308
00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:47.541
I came here for closure.

309
00:17:47.541 --> 00:17:48.875
Okay?

310
00:17:48.875 --> 00:17:50.500
You came here for closure?

311
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.958
You mean to hide your secrets?

312
00:17:52.958 --> 00:17:54.833
Is that so bad? Yes.

313
00:17:54.833 --> 00:17:56.833
That just means
you can't handle the truth.

314
00:17:58.375 --> 00:18:00.708
And what is the truth?

315
00:18:01.333 --> 00:18:03.083
The truth is.

316
00:18:03.708 --> 00:18:04.583
we're both fucked up

317
00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:06.750
people were damaged past.

318
00:18:08.458 --> 00:18:10.708
We are both
fucked up people?

319
00:18:10.708 --> 00:18:11.750
Yeah.

320
00:18:14.208 --> 00:18:15.458
Okay.

321
00:18:16.708 --> 00:18:18.875
Interesting timing in saying that.

322
00:18:21.458 --> 00:18:24.083
I want to know what happened to you.

323
00:18:25.083 --> 00:18:28.958
What made you into this.
Jeffrey. that you are?

324
00:18:29.583 --> 00:18:31.750
That kills other people.

325
00:18:32.833 --> 00:18:33.291
Mm?

326
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.500
I don't know.

327
00:18:37.708 --> 00:18:39.166
No. you do know.

328
00:18:39.958 --> 00:18:42.833
You're just been denying
it for so long.

329
00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:46.500
Tell me Jefrey.

330
00:18:48.083 --> 00:18:50.541
Tell me. what led you to be this man?

331
00:18:56.750 --> 00:19:00.750
Uh. When I was a little kid.

332
00:19:00.750 --> 00:19:02.833
like a teenager.

333
00:19:03.833 --> 00:19:06.458
I went to this. um. to this camp

334
00:19:07.708 --> 00:19:09.625
for three summers.

335
00:19:10.083 --> 00:19:12.458
and they made me do. uh.

336
00:19:13.083 --> 00:19:15.458
they made me do some bad stuff.

337
00:19:16.458 --> 00:19:17.375
What bad stuff?

338
00:19:18.833 --> 00:19:21.375
Like killing type stuff.

339
00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.125
No. more specific.

340
00:19:26.458 --> 00:19:27.291
Am

341
00:19:31.208 --> 00:19:33.625
I went to this camp and

342
00:19:34.833 --> 00:19:37.583
they had these people in boxes.

343
00:19:37.583 --> 00:19:42.208
I couldn't really speak English
or whatever language they were speaking.

344
00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:44.666
Uh.

345
00:19:46.291 --> 00:19:47.708
The camp counselors gave us

346
00:19:49.208 --> 00:19:50.625
machetes

347
00:19:51.458 --> 00:19:53.625
and bone saws

348
00:19:54.875 --> 00:19:57.125
and told us to cut them up.

349
00:19:59.333 --> 00:20:04.458
I used to use to start with their heads

350
00:20:04.458 --> 00:20:07.208
because I felt that that would be

351
00:20:07.625 --> 00:20:09.250
more humane.

352
00:20:11.583 --> 00:20:12.875
So it gets it gets worse.

353
00:20:12.875 --> 00:20:14.333
And they would.

354
00:20:16.083 --> 00:20:17.458
They would make us touch

355
00:20:17.458 --> 00:20:20.000
the dead bodies
and take pictures with them.

356
00:20:21.333 --> 00:20:23.750
And then they said that

357
00:20:23.750 --> 00:20:26.125
if we said anything.
they would kill our parents.

358
00:20:26.125 --> 00:20:29.041
just like those people in the boxes.

359
00:20:31.833 --> 00:20:33.500
Did you ever tell anyone?

360
00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.375
I'm telling you now.

361
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:36.708
Besides.

362
00:20:38.250 --> 00:20:41.250
no one needs to know
what's saved up in here.

363
00:20:47.375 --> 00:20:49.208
You know. that’s why I think.

364
00:20:50.208 --> 00:20:52.833
You know. that's why
I think we belong together.

365
00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.625
because we grew up
the same.

366
00:20:55.625 --> 00:20:57.583
We have similar upbringings.

367
00:20:57.583 --> 00:20:59.750
Okay. that's where you
were very wrong.

368
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:01.791
What do you mean?

369
00:21:01.791 --> 00:21:02.833
We're not similar.

370
00:21:04.125 --> 00:21:05.708
You don't think so?

371
00:21:06.375 --> 00:21:07.083
Jeff?

372
00:21:08.958 --> 00:21:10.458
I'm married to a man.

373
00:21:10.458 --> 00:21:12.333
That makes me happier
than you ever could.

374
00:21:15.208 --> 00:21:17.458
I have kids that I love dearly.

375
00:21:18.583 --> 00:21:21.416
I don't want someone
like you around my kids.

376
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:24.333
So it's the kids. is it? Yes.

377
00:21:26.708 --> 00:21:28.208
You're just hiding behind them.

378
00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.833
No. no. you just.

379
00:21:31.833 --> 00:21:34.333
You're just using them to hide
behind them.

380
00:21:34.583 --> 00:21:37.125
And sooner or later.
you'll come out and be rotten

381
00:21:37.125 --> 00:21:38.250
Penelope. again.

382
00:21:44.083 --> 00:21:45.625
Have you ever killed anyone?

383
00:21:47.208 --> 00:21:50.083
What? No.

384
00:21:50.083 --> 00:21:52.833
You know.
I guess we all don't have it in us

385
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.750
Have you ever killed anyone?

386
00:21:59.375 --> 00:22:01.708
How could you just ask me that
when I just told you about how I.

387
00:22:01.708 --> 00:22:03.750
No. no. I meant

388
00:22:04.208 --> 00:22:05.666
while we were married.

389
00:22:11.083 --> 00:22:11.708
Yeah.

390
00:22:14.208 --> 00:22:15.333
How many?

391
00:22:19.083 --> 00:22:19.958
Eight or nine.

392
00:22:19.958 --> 00:22:20.458
I don't.

393
00:22:20.458 --> 00:22:20.958
I don't know.

394
00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:22.375
I lost count.

395
00:22:24.583 --> 00:22:25.708
Why didn't you tell me?

396
00:22:28.125 --> 00:22:28.958
Because I was afraid.

397
00:22:28.958 --> 00:22:30.833
You get upset. you

398
00:22:30.958 --> 00:22:32.625
look at me different.

399
00:22:33.958 --> 00:22:37.958
So you ended all those
lives to keep me?

400
00:22:38.875 --> 00:22:39.500
No.

401
00:22:39.916 --> 00:22:40.958
No.

402
00:22:40.958 --> 00:22:43.583
I ended all those lives to keep me.

403
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:46.458
To be true to who I am.

404
00:22:46.833 --> 00:22:47.541
[laughing]

405
00:22:47.833 --> 00:22:49.708
Do you know how absurd
that sounds?

406
00:22:50.125 --> 00:22:51.250
Well. yeah.

407
00:22:51.583 --> 00:22:54.250
Yeah. it's absurd
because we are awful human beings.

408
00:22:55.458 --> 00:22:56.958
Unbelievable.

409
00:22:56.958 --> 00:22:59.375
Because I'm a murderer as fuck.

410
00:22:59.375 --> 00:23:00.625
I think I knew. though.

411
00:23:00.625 --> 00:23:03.375
Deep down.

412
00:23:03.375 --> 00:23:04.458
You leaving late.

413
00:23:04.458 --> 00:23:05.833
Coming home late.

414
00:23:05.833 --> 00:23:08.583
Not showering and so
you could see me.

415
00:23:08.583 --> 00:23:10.458
I can't help the way that I am.

416
00:23:11.875 --> 00:23:13.458
How do you feel right now?

417
00:23:17.833 --> 00:23:20.333
Uh. the popcorn was good.

418
00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:25.458
Other than that. um.

419
00:23:25.458 --> 00:23:26.333
I don't know.

420
00:23:30.291 --> 00:23:31.541
[door knocking]

421
00:23:33.458 --> 00:23:34.708
What time is it?

422
00:23:35.583 --> 00:23:36.250
Oh. shoot.

423
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:37.458
It's already three.

424
00:23:38.375 --> 00:23:39.041
I'll go to the back.

425
00:23:39.041 --> 00:23:39.833
No. no. no. no.

426
00:23:39.833 --> 00:23:40.625
Stay here.

427
00:23:41.083 --> 00:23:41.666
Are you sure?

428
00:23:41.666 --> 00:23:42.291
Yea.

429
00:23:42.625 --> 00:23:43.000
Stay here.

430
00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:43.583
Okay.

431
00:23:46.208 --> 00:23:46.833
Oh. Hi.

432
00:23:46.833 --> 00:23:47.708
Hi. Hi.

433
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:49.833
I'm so sorry I got held up earlier.

434
00:23:49.833 --> 00:23:51.416
No. no. That’s fine. That’s fine.

435
00:23:51.416 --> 00:23:53.166
I have a lot of work to do today.

436
00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:57.125
Um. Can you just come back tomorrow?

437
00:23:57.833 --> 00:24:00.083
I need to be paid today.

438
00:24:01.125 --> 00:24:02.000
Can you just wait?

439
00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.625
I am kinda busy at the moment.

440
00:24:03.791 --> 00:24:04.666
No.

441
00:24:04.708 --> 00:24:07.208
I need the money now to
pay my workers.

442
00:24:09.125 --> 00:24:09.875
Okay.

443
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:12.208
Okay. I'll get my check.

444
00:24:12.208 --> 00:24:13.333
Just hold on for a sec.

445
00:24:13.333 --> 00:24:13.833
Yeah.

446
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:28.000
Ricardo.

447
00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:28.750
Here you go.

448
00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:31.208
Thank you.

449
00:24:31.208 --> 00:24:33.333
Thank you. See you tomorrow.

450
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:34.333
Okay.

451
00:24:34.333 --> 00:24:35.583
Have a great day.

452
00:24:36.791 --> 00:24:37.791
[door closing]

453
00:24:38.083 --> 00:24:39.791
[door lock]

454
00:24:48.708 --> 00:24:50.625
Why do you look so bothered?

455
00:24:51.583 --> 00:24:53.541
Because he almost saw me.

456
00:24:53.791 --> 00:24:54.458
And?

457
00:24:56.958 --> 00:24:58.583
Were going to do something to him?

458
00:24:59.458 --> 00:25:00.208
Yeah.

459
00:25:02.250 --> 00:25:03.333
With this.

460
00:25:06.333 --> 00:25:08.500
You were going to hit Ricardo
with a pole?

461
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:11.208
I was going to bash his
fuckin brains in.

462
00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.333
Why?

463
00:25:13.333 --> 00:25:14.583
Because

464
00:25:15.208 --> 00:25:16.958
Because of what?

465
00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:20.250
I wanted to make sure
he doesn't see them all.

466
00:25:22.208 --> 00:25:24.625
I don't want his kids to
see him anymore.

467
00:25:24.958 --> 00:25:27.083
I want to make him dead.

468
00:25:30.208 --> 00:25:31.875
I wanted to end him.

469
00:25:34.875 --> 00:25:35.916
Hmm.

470
00:26:20.291 --> 00:26:23.666
[the sound of waves]

471
00:26:53.791 --> 00:26:55.000
What's wrong with me?

472
00:26:55.583 --> 00:26:58.833
It's like I'm stuck in this darkness.

473
00:27:00.083 --> 00:27:02.791
You're not stuck in the darkness.

474
00:27:04.250 --> 00:27:06.583
You are the darkness.

475
00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:07.458
No. I'm not.

476
00:27:07.458 --> 00:27:08.833
Yes. you are.

477
00:27:09.583 --> 00:27:11.250
You killed me.

478
00:27:11.250 --> 00:27:14.583
You killed all those people.

479
00:27:14.583 --> 00:27:16.125
You're a monster.

480
00:27:16.125 --> 00:27:18.333
I'm not a monster.

481
00:27:18.583 --> 00:27:19.375
I'm just.

482
00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.625
Lost.

483
00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:25.833
You're lost because you chose to be.

484
00:27:27.125 --> 00:27:28.333
You could have been happy. Jeffrey.

485
00:27:28.333 --> 00:27:29.208
But no.

486
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.708
You chose this life.

487
00:27:31.708 --> 00:27:32.500
Darkness.

488
00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.250
Solitude.

489
00:27:36.833 --> 00:27:39.708
Why is that pole over there?

490
00:27:40.833 --> 00:27:42.750
You were going to use it
to hit me with it. weren't you?

491
00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.583
No. no. I would never hurt you.

492
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.708
But you already did.

493
00:27:49.208 --> 00:27:51.541
You took everything from me.

494
00:27:54.708 --> 00:27:55.250
Wait.

495
00:27:55.625 --> 00:27:57.625
How did I get here?

496
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.708
I don't remember walking in here.

497
00:28:00.750 --> 00:28:03.500
And why are you sitting on the bed
like that?

498
00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.333
I don't know.

499
00:28:07.833 --> 00:28:10.625
I’m just so lost and alone.

500
00:28:11.875 --> 00:28:12.583
Like you.

501
00:28:16.208 --> 00:28:18.375
But you're not alone. though.

502
00:28:22.125 --> 00:28:24.791
You're not a real man. Jeffrey.

503
00:28:26.250 --> 00:28:29.166
You have a pole in your bias.
a killing instrument.

504
00:28:33.708 --> 00:28:36.583
That paul probably belongs
in this house.

505
00:28:37.208 --> 00:28:38.916
It was probably a piece of the plumbing.

506
00:28:38.916 --> 00:28:39.791
Mhm.

507
00:28:40.458 --> 00:28:42.458
It's important.

508
00:28:42.458 --> 00:28:44.583
It's a small part of a whole.

509
00:28:44.583 --> 00:28:46.750
A small part of the whole.

510
00:28:47.208 --> 00:28:49.625
Which means of what?

511
00:28:49.625 --> 00:28:51.208
This house?

512
00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.958
A family?

513
00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:55.166
Us?

514
00:28:59.458 --> 00:29:01.333
And what have you done?

515
00:29:02.333 --> 00:29:06.333
What could you have possibly done
to deserve this

516
00:29:06.333 --> 00:29:08.208
life you're living?

517
00:29:08.375 --> 00:29:09.250
Dirty.

518
00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:11.041
Alone.

519
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:12.500
On the streets.

520
00:29:13.375 --> 00:29:14.375
Wait. Are you?

521
00:29:14.375 --> 00:29:15.500
What?

522
00:29:16.583 --> 00:29:17.375
Are you amused?

523
00:29:17.375 --> 00:29:18.583
Yes .

524
00:29:24.125 --> 00:29:26.583
Why are you upset?

525
00:29:33.958 --> 00:29:34.583
I don't know.

526
00:29:34.583 --> 00:29:35.750
I just can't seem to.

527
00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.083
We don't exist anymore. Jeffrey.

528
00:29:39.458 --> 00:29:40.625
But you loved me?

529
00:29:40.625 --> 00:29:42.500
[laughing]

530
00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:44.208
I never loved you.

531
00:29:45.458 --> 00:29:47.458
I was too busy loving others.

532
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.708
Well. I was carefully observing you.

533
00:29:52.708 --> 00:29:54.958
Watching others.

534
00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:01.208
And that's why I ruined you. Jeffrey.

535
00:30:01.208 --> 00:30:03.333
Because you.

536
00:30:03.333 --> 00:30:06.083
Taught me how to be a ruiner.

537
00:30:08.333 --> 00:30:10.375
You understand that?

538
00:30:10.875 --> 00:30:11.875
Yeah.

539
00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:14.958
But. um.

540
00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.083
Why are you?

541
00:30:17.083 --> 00:30:18.458
Why are you saying all this? Why?

542
00:30:18.458 --> 00:30:20.666
Why are you talking to me this way?

543
00:30:21.458 --> 00:30:22.958
Because I want.

544
00:30:23.583 --> 00:30:24.333
I want.

545
00:30:30.208 --> 00:30:32.583
What's happening?

546
00:30:34.583 --> 00:30:36.250
He's coming for you. Jeffrey.

547
00:30:37.041 --> 00:30:37.916
Who?

548
00:30:39.666 --> 00:30:41.416
You know who.

549
00:30:41.833 --> 00:30:43.958
Your tormentor.

550
00:30:43.958 --> 00:30:46.708
The one that's been following you
your whole life.

551
00:30:48.083 --> 00:30:50.583
The one that's been
fucking you.

552
00:30:50.958 --> 00:30:52.916
[laughing]

553
00:30:58.583 --> 00:30:59.458
Shit.

554
00:31:06.708 --> 00:31:07.583
Baby.

555
00:31:08.583 --> 00:31:11.500
Penelope. please put that down.

556
00:31:12.708 --> 00:31:16.333
All I need to do is just stick
the screwdriver down my throat

557
00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:18.833
to make you go away.

558
00:31:53.458 --> 00:31:54.583
What's wrong?

559
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.375
Talk to me.

560
00:32:13.250 --> 00:32:13.791
Let me help you.

561
00:32:13.791 --> 00:32:15.458
Get away from me.

562
00:32:19.083 --> 00:32:20.583
Well. you can talk to me about anything.

563
00:32:20.583 --> 00:32:23.416
I don't want or need your help Jeffrey.

564
00:32:23.416 --> 00:32:25.083
You can’t help yourself.

565
00:32:26.125 --> 00:32:26.958
Go.

566
00:32:27.625 --> 00:32:28.500
Go right now.

567
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:29.875
Go. please.

568
00:32:29.875 --> 00:32:31.791
Jeffrey. please go.

569
00:32:32.541 --> 00:32:33.416
Alright.

570
00:33:18.541 --> 00:33:19.666
Closer.

571
00:33:24.083 --> 00:33:25.208
Closer.

572
00:33:30.583 --> 00:33:31.708
Closer.

573
00:33:37.625 --> 00:33:38.750
Closer.

574
00:33:43.333 --> 00:33:44.458
Closer.

575
00:33:56.583 --> 00:33:57.708
Closer.

576
00:34:00.208 --> 00:34:01.333
Closer.

577
00:34:05.958 --> 00:34:08.125
[laughing]

578
00:35:20.875 --> 00:35:23.083
[laughing]

579
00:35:46.166 --> 00:35:47.791
Oh my God.

580
00:35:57.458 --> 00:35:59.083
Jeffrey.

581
00:36:03.583 --> 00:36:05.333
Are you okay?

582
00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.333
Yeah.

583
00:36:14.083 --> 00:36:15.916
What just happened?

584
00:36:17.333 --> 00:36:18.166
Uh.

585
00:36:19.708 --> 00:36:20.166
Nothing.

586
00:36:20.166 --> 00:36:20.583
I'm here.

587
00:36:20.583 --> 00:36:21.500
I'm okay.

588
00:36:24.208 --> 00:36:26.916
Kind of left me or something else weird?

589
00:36:28.208 --> 00:36:32.333
Honestly.
it was like you were in a trance.

590
00:36:32.333 --> 00:36:33.250
Um.

591
00:36:35.083 --> 00:36:35.791
I don't know.

592
00:36:36.208 --> 00:36:37.625
I’m not myself.

593
00:36:37.625 --> 00:36:39.333
I had a vision about you.

594
00:36:39.333 --> 00:36:40.625
A vision?

595
00:36:40.958 --> 00:36:41.500
Yea.

596
00:36:41.666 --> 00:36:43.208
What happened in the vision?

597
00:36:45.791 --> 00:36:47.333
You were. um...

598
00:36:48.958 --> 00:36:51.208
You're were being mean to me.

599
00:36:51.625 --> 00:36:52.750
And. um...

600
00:36:55.333 --> 00:36:56.875
You were scary.

601
00:36:56.875 --> 00:36:58.583
I was scared of you.

602
00:36:58.583 --> 00:37:00.125
I was trembling.

603
00:37:00.583 --> 00:37:02.416
There is something I need to tell you.

604
00:37:04.208 --> 00:37:05.958
No. no. no. no.

605
00:37:05.958 --> 00:37:08.208
You might want to be
seated for the...

606
00:37:08.208 --> 00:37:09.375
What is it?

607
00:37:15.541 --> 00:37:17.083
I am not who you think I am.

608
00:37:19.083 --> 00:37:19.833
What do you mean?

609
00:37:22.250 --> 00:37:24.250
I am not Penelope.

610
00:37:24.833 --> 00:37:28.208
Or. No. I mean. I am.

611
00:37:29.375 --> 00:37:30.416
But I am not.

612
00:37:31.583 --> 00:37:32.875
I don't understand.

613
00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:34.625
No. of course you're not understanding.

614
00:37:34.625 --> 00:37:36.250
Sit down.

615
00:37:36.708 --> 00:37:38.833
I need to explain it to you. Jeffrey.

616
00:37:42.333 --> 00:37:43.750
Basically.

617
00:37:45.458 --> 00:37:46.875
I was with

618
00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:48.250
many

619
00:37:48.708 --> 00:37:49.375
men.

620
00:37:49.708 --> 00:37:51.333
While we were together.

621
00:37:55.208 --> 00:37:57.208
What do you mean by
you were with?

622
00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:59.541
Well. basically. I had many afferas.

623
00:38:01.041 --> 00:38:01.958
[laughing]

624
00:38:02.208 --> 00:38:03.083
With who?

625
00:38:03.375 --> 00:38:04.083
That doesn't matter.

626
00:38:05.125 --> 00:38:06.375
Happens so often.

627
00:38:07.625 --> 00:38:08.583
I know. I know.

628
00:38:08.583 --> 00:38:09.708
I was wrong.

629
00:38:09.833 --> 00:38:10.583
But.

630
00:38:10.833 --> 00:38:12.250
I was weak.

631
00:38:13.708 --> 00:38:15.083
I just really. really

632
00:38:15.208 --> 00:38:17.458
wanted to feel all these men

633
00:38:17.625 --> 00:38:19.125
inside of me.

634
00:38:20.666 --> 00:38:22.166
[laughing]

635
00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:27.500
Why are you telling me this?

636
00:38:27.708 --> 00:38:29.000
I mean. I just...

637
00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.125
I can’t keep living with the secret.

638
00:38:33.083 --> 00:38:35.375
Why are you telling me this now?

639
00:38:35.375 --> 00:38:37.208
Because you're right here.

640
00:38:37.208 --> 00:38:39.750
So why should I have to carry
all this guilt on my own?

641
00:38:40.333 --> 00:38:42.125
Why are you telling me this now?

642
00:38:42.125 --> 00:38:43.583
I don't know.

643
00:38:43.583 --> 00:38:45.833
Cause I just want to fucking
tell you the truth.

644
00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:51.833
I can't take this.

645
00:38:51.833 --> 00:38:52.500
I need to.

646
00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:54.875
It was always so easy.

647
00:38:59.875 --> 00:39:01.291
What was easy?

648
00:39:01.958 --> 00:39:04.000
Well. they all wanted me.

649
00:39:05.375 --> 00:39:06.083
All of them.

650
00:39:06.083 --> 00:39:08.666
They all wanted me.

651
00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:09.958
Hey Jeffrey.

652
00:39:11.458 --> 00:39:12.833
Do you remember all those times

653
00:39:12.833 --> 00:39:14.625
we were trying to have kids?

654
00:39:16.250 --> 00:39:19.041
That’s really trying
to have kids?

655
00:39:21.833 --> 00:39:24.333
But we thought. or you thought.

656
00:39:24.958 --> 00:39:27.500
But the doctors had some. I don't know.

657
00:39:27.625 --> 00:39:30.500
conspiratorial rasputin against us.

658
00:39:31.083 --> 00:39:35.458
Remember you were telling me
that behind closed doors they would say.

659
00:39:35.875 --> 00:39:38.708
Those two are not fit to be parents.

660
00:39:39.333 --> 00:39:42.583
Those two should definitely
not have kids.

661
00:39:45.208 --> 00:39:47.875
I thought you doctor's
was actually funny.

662
00:39:47.875 --> 00:39:50.041
It was quiet
when they should have been talking.

663
00:39:50.041 --> 00:39:51.041
Yea.

664
00:39:52.375 --> 00:39:53.750
Do you want to know why?

665
00:39:55.625 --> 00:39:56.208
Yeah.

666
00:39:56.208 --> 00:39:57.291
Tell me why.

667
00:39:59.458 --> 00:40:02.000
Because it was me. Jeffrey.

668
00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:02.625
It was me.

669
00:40:02.625 --> 00:40:07.083
And the reason.
because I aborted more than. what?

670
00:40:07.083 --> 00:40:08.833
Seven. eight of your children?

671
00:40:08.833 --> 00:40:10.583
[laughing]

672
00:40:12.958 --> 00:40:14.000
Penelope.

673
00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.583
How could you kill our children?

674
00:40:16.625 --> 00:40:17.000
I don't know.

675
00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.083
But I did. Ha ha.

676
00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:20.083
No.

677
00:40:20.083 --> 00:40:21.000
Yes.

678
00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000
And I would do it all over again.

679
00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:23.708
[laughing]

680
00:40:31.083 --> 00:40:33.083
Where do you think you're going?

681
00:40:38.458 --> 00:40:40.333
You know what I think?

682
00:40:40.458 --> 00:40:41.458
What?

683
00:40:42.708 --> 00:40:45.583
I think a none of this is real.

684
00:40:47.833 --> 00:40:50.125
I think I'm going out of my mind.

685
00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:01.291
Hey.

686
00:41:01.708 --> 00:41:02.333
It's the truth.

687
00:41:02.333 --> 00:41:04.333
I know you don't want to hear it.
but sorry. It's the truth.

688
00:41:04.333 --> 00:41:05.708
How could you do something like that?

689
00:41:05.708 --> 00:41:06.458
I don't know.

690
00:41:06.458 --> 00:41:08.958
Because I'm a mean fucking
cunting bitch.

691
00:41:09.250 --> 00:41:12.125
How could you do something like that
and not even think twice. Penelope?

692
00:41:12.250 --> 00:41:15.000
And how could you kill a man
and not think twice?

693
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:15.708
Stop it.

694
00:41:16.083 --> 00:41:17.750
Murder is not abortion. okay?

695
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:19.458
You can't compare the two.

696
00:41:19.458 --> 00:41:20.500
I didn’t.

697
00:41:20.583 --> 00:41:23.375
Yes. you did.
You just said it was the same.

698
00:41:23.375 --> 00:41:24.958
No?

699
00:41:24.958 --> 00:41:27.416
Don't you feel sorry
or bad at all?

700
00:41:33.375 --> 00:41:35.666
Die slowly please.

701
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:38.041
Good.

702
00:41:38.416 --> 00:41:39.500
Did slowly.

703
00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.416
I am.

704
00:41:40.416 --> 00:41:41.125
Good.

705
00:41:45.083 --> 00:41:47.125
You look so pitiful.

706
00:41:48.833 --> 00:41:51.625
Well. you know. then I guess
that was always

707
00:41:52.208 --> 00:41:54.458
the thing that I found
kind of intriguing about you.

708
00:41:57.875 --> 00:41:59.958
You're a murderer. Jeffrey.

709
00:41:59.958 --> 00:42:01.083
Who takes lives.

710
00:42:01.083 --> 00:42:03.500
You don't create them.

711
00:42:07.458 --> 00:42:08.833
Of course.

712
00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.875
Now. Billy and I.

713
00:42:11.708 --> 00:42:12.833
We have two kids.

714
00:42:14.250 --> 00:42:16.625
And we're so happy.

715
00:42:17.583 --> 00:42:19.875
But I think I'm even happier

716
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:23.333
rendering you fatherless forever.

717
00:42:33.125 --> 00:42:35.041
Don't you have anything to say?

718
00:42:36.583 --> 00:42:37.333
I...

719
00:42:39.750 --> 00:42:40.833
No. I don’t...

720
00:42:40.833 --> 00:42:41.791
I don't know what to say.

721
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.291
Good because I don't really want
to hear what you have to say anyway.

722
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.583
Do you remember

723
00:42:52.708 --> 00:42:55.291
the Christmas party at
your workplace?

724
00:42:56.708 --> 00:42:57.333
Yeah?

725
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.833
Where you introduce me to Uriah?

726
00:43:00.875 --> 00:43:02.541
Your big dominant boss.

727
00:43:03.166 --> 00:43:04.375
Can I?

728
00:43:04.583 --> 00:43:05.875
Don’t

729
00:43:06.625 --> 00:43:07.708
t ouch her.

730
00:43:08.458 --> 00:43:09.708
Little bro.

731
00:43:09.833 --> 00:43:12.708
And I could tell immediately
that he was into me.

732
00:43:12.708 --> 00:43:13.750
And you could. too.

733
00:43:13.750 --> 00:43:15.708
That's why you became jealous when it.

734
00:43:17.250 --> 00:43:17.583
And I.

735
00:43:17.583 --> 00:43:21.208
I pretended not to notice
so that you wouldn't get upset.

736
00:43:23.458 --> 00:43:24.750
So that later

737
00:43:24.750 --> 00:43:27.833
on during that party.
I was at the juice bar

738
00:43:28.458 --> 00:43:30.458
and then he came over.

739
00:43:31.875 --> 00:43:34.125
And he took me back to the
storage closet.

740
00:43:37.375 --> 00:43:39.875
He did some amazing things to me.

741
00:43:41.083 --> 00:43:43.375
Things that you could never do.

742
00:43:44.208 --> 00:43:46.333
I was so satisfied

743
00:43:46.333 --> 00:43:48.500
after that Christmas party. Oh.

744
00:43:51.458 --> 00:43:54.500
I didn't tell you. Jeffrey. because.

745
00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:57.708
I didn't want you to lose your job
because you could never stand up to him.

746
00:44:00.458 --> 00:44:01.208
Because you don't

747
00:44:01.208 --> 00:44:04.291
kill the powerful and dominant.

748
00:44:04.291 --> 00:44:05.000
Do you?

749
00:44:07.125 --> 00:44:09.083
You prey on the weak.

750
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:21.958
Why are you being so?

751
00:44:24.583 --> 00:44:26.041
Why do you want to hear more?

752
00:44:26.041 --> 00:44:27.583
No.

753
00:44:27.583 --> 00:44:28.458
No. I don't.

754
00:44:28.458 --> 00:44:29.833
Because I have plenty more

755
00:44:29.833 --> 00:44:31.333
where that came from.

756
00:44:35.458 --> 00:44:36.625
Jeffrey.

757
00:44:39.333 --> 00:44:40.500
Look at you.

758
00:44:43.208 --> 00:44:44.958
What's left for me now is just.

759
00:44:47.250 --> 00:44:48.833
To move on.

760
00:44:50.083 --> 00:44:52.208
To leave you in the past.

761
00:44:53.708 --> 00:44:56.125
Oh. And I'm

762
00:44:56.125 --> 00:44:59.458
sorry that I got to do that
by destroying you.

763
00:45:00.333 --> 00:45:02.625
I think that I am not sorry at all.

764
00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:05.291
Why do you want to destroy me?

765
00:45:07.083 --> 00:45:09.208
Because you deserve it.

766
00:45:12.958 --> 00:45:15.208
You don't deserve a life.

767
00:45:18.250 --> 00:45:18.875
Penelope.

768
00:45:18.875 --> 00:45:20.833
We could have had children.

769
00:45:20.833 --> 00:45:21.375
Ugh.

770
00:45:24.458 --> 00:45:27.000
The thought of having something
that's half me.

771
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.750
Half you. Never.

772
00:45:28.750 --> 00:45:30.083
I could never do it.

773
00:45:30.083 --> 00:45:32.208
Well. never.

774
00:45:35.333 --> 00:45:35.625
Okay.

775
00:45:35.625 --> 00:45:36.708
We're done here.

776
00:45:40.708 --> 00:45:41.708
Shall we leave the past

777
00:45:41.708 --> 00:45:42.958
in the past?

778
00:45:43.083 --> 00:45:43.708
Good.

779
00:45:47.333 --> 00:45:48.750
I'm going leave. so.

780
00:46:17.833 --> 00:46:20.708
Oh. Remember the first time?

781
00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:24.875
That you introduced me to Billy.

782
00:46:24.875 --> 00:46:28.000
Your best friend Billy.
at the Super Bowl party

783
00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.916
or whatever It was.

784
00:46:31.333 --> 00:46:34.916
When I met him. I walked up to him.

785
00:46:37.458 --> 00:46:38.458
And I said.

786
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:41.041
I want you Billy.

787
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.916
[laughing]

788
00:46:45.416 --> 00:46:46.833
[knocking]

789
00:46:59.958 --> 00:47:00.791
Hello.

790
00:47:00.791 --> 00:47:01.750
Hey.

791
00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:03.333
Is everything okay?

792
00:47:03.333 --> 00:47:04.458
We heard the starkins.

793
00:47:04.458 --> 00:47:05.583
So?

794
00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:08.583
Oh. Sorry about that.

795
00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:10.250
Uh. we.

796
00:47:10.458 --> 00:47:12.458
My wife and I. we live next door.

797
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:15.583
Oh. Oh. Um.

798
00:47:15.583 --> 00:47:16.875
No. All good here. Just.

799
00:47:16.875 --> 00:47:19.500
My ex-husband had a little bit
too much to drink.

800
00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:23.750
Okay. well. if you need anything.
don't hesitate to call us. okay?

801
00:47:24.250 --> 00:47:24.708
Okay.

802
00:47:24.708 --> 00:47:25.958
Thank you.

803
00:47:34.375 --> 00:47:35.875
Hey. Hey.

804
00:47:35.875 --> 00:47:39.333
Could you come back for a second? Yes.

805
00:47:39.333 --> 00:47:40.833
Are you single?

806
00:47:41.208 --> 00:47:43.333
No. not really.

807
00:47:43.333 --> 00:47:44.625
I have a life.

808
00:47:48.250 --> 00:47:49.500
But could you be?

809
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.708
What? Yeah.

810
00:47:52.708 --> 00:47:54.458
I can be. I guess.

811
00:47:54.958 --> 00:47:56.375
Okay. Right.

812
00:47:57.250 --> 00:47:58.000
Okay.

813
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.833
Do you have a phone on you?

814
00:48:02.625 --> 00:48:03.125
Yeah.

815
00:48:03.125 --> 00:48:04.083
Right here.

816
00:48:08.208 --> 00:48:10.166
You look like the funnest fuck.

817
00:48:11.250 --> 00:48:11.958
You too.

818
00:48:13.458 --> 00:48:14.500
Thank you.

819
00:48:14.708 --> 00:48:15.583
You're welcome.

820
00:48:17.583 --> 00:48:18.750
Here you go.

821
00:48:18.958 --> 00:48:19.750
Thanks.

822
00:48:20.208 --> 00:48:22.458
I'll call whenever.

823
00:48:22.458 --> 00:48:23.958
What about tonight?

824
00:48:24.708 --> 00:48:26.708
What about tonight?

825
00:48:26.708 --> 00:48:27.500
You know.

826
00:48:29.333 --> 00:48:30.833
Your funnest fuck.

827
00:48:32.333 --> 00:48:33.333
You too.

828
00:48:34.625 --> 00:48:35.333
See you.

829
00:48:36.583 --> 00:48:37.708
See you later.

830
00:48:44.333 --> 00:48:45.333
Is that what you wanted to do?

831
00:48:45.333 --> 00:48:46.875
Did you want to make me mad?

832
00:48:46.875 --> 00:48:47.833
Yes.

833
00:48:49.333 --> 00:48:50.583
You're a killer. Jeffrey.

834
00:48:50.583 --> 00:48:51.708
You're a monster.

835
00:48:51.708 --> 00:48:52.500
Why would you that?

836
00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:53.291
Scare me.

837
00:49:05.875 --> 00:49:07.541
Hey. man.

838
00:49:08.708 --> 00:49:09.416
Hey.

839
00:49:09.708 --> 00:49:10.333
How are you?

840
00:49:10.333 --> 00:49:11.708
I'm good. How you doing?

841
00:49:11.708 --> 00:49:12.750
Good.

842
00:49:13.333 --> 00:49:15.416
Uriah wants to see you. though.

843
00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:20.875
Any idea why?

844
00:49:21.208 --> 00:49:23.458
Oh. I don't ask questions.

845
00:49:23.458 --> 00:49:24.958
I just work here.

846
00:49:28.333 --> 00:49:29.083
Really?

847
00:49:30.333 --> 00:49:31.958
Pretty sure.

848
00:49:33.708 --> 00:49:36.583
Well. good luck.

849
00:49:38.333 --> 00:49:39.250
Hey. Ray.

850
00:49:39.458 --> 00:49:41.333
You wanted to see me?

851
00:49:41.333 --> 00:49:42.875
Hey Jeffrey.

852
00:49:43.458 --> 00:49:45.000
Thanks for coming in.

853
00:49:46.375 --> 00:49:48.416
Have a sit.

854
00:49:52.541 --> 00:49:53.833
Is. um...

855
00:49:54.958 --> 00:49:56.250
everything okay?

856
00:49:56.833 --> 00:49:58.458
No. not really.

857
00:49:58.458 --> 00:50:01.625
I'm afraid
I'm going to have to let you go.

858
00:50:01.625 --> 00:50:04.500
What? Why?

859
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.000
Sorry. man.

860
00:50:06.083 --> 00:50:09.041
Company's downsizing.
and we have to let some people go.

861
00:50:10.208 --> 00:50:12.125
Unfortunately. you are
one of those people.

862
00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:17.791
I could write you a good preference
letter and service pace last you a while.

863
00:50:18.625 --> 00:50:21.458
Oh. Jeffrey.

864
00:50:22.208 --> 00:50:25.583
A woman you brought
to the Christmas party.

865
00:50:25.708 --> 00:50:27.833
She was amazing. I must say.

866
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.375
Wait. what does that mean?

867
00:50:33.708 --> 00:50:35.333
That's what that means.

868
00:50:35.333 --> 00:50:35.750
You're right.

869
00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:37.708
That's my wife you talking about.

870
00:50:38.583 --> 00:50:39.375
I know.

871
00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:42.416
I fucked her in the storage closet.

872
00:50:45.833 --> 00:50:48.250
And I asked her to come over tonight.

873
00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:49.583
She said yea.

874
00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.375
So that's that.

875
00:50:51.458 --> 00:50:53.250
Why the fuck would you do
something like that?

876
00:50:53.250 --> 00:50:55.166
You're going to do something
about it ittle bro?

877
00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:01.791
Are you going to do something
about it. Jeffrey?

878
00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.833
I get what I like.

879
00:51:06.375 --> 00:51:07.833
And I like your wife.

880
00:51:22.083 --> 00:51:23.375
He fired me.

881
00:51:37.458 --> 00:51:40.083
Hey. I'm sorry.

882
00:51:40.083 --> 00:51:41.458
I'm sorry.

883
00:51:41.458 --> 00:51:42.375
You know.

884
00:51:43.875 --> 00:51:44.833
I was just scared.

885
00:51:44.833 --> 00:51:48.833
I didn't want you to lose your job
because of me rejecting him.

886
00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:52.458
You're lying to me
and you're cheating on me.

887
00:51:52.708 --> 00:51:54.583
I would never cheat on you.

888
00:51:54.583 --> 00:51:56.583
He told me he fucked you.

889
00:51:56.833 --> 00:51:58.958
He's obviously lying.

890
00:52:00.625 --> 00:52:01.583
He said you were going to his

891
00:52:01.583 --> 00:52:02.708
house tonight.

892
00:52:02.708 --> 00:52:03.958
Just to cook him dinner.

893
00:52:03.958 --> 00:52:05.375
To cook him dinner?

894
00:52:05.458 --> 00:52:06.875
What about my dinner?

895
00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000
I was just scared. you know. I didn't.

896
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.708
I didn't mean to hurt you.

897
00:52:11.708 --> 00:52:13.500
You didn't mean to hurt me? Penelope?

898
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:15.083
You cheated on me.

899
00:52:15.083 --> 00:52:16.833
It's not true.

900
00:52:16.833 --> 00:52:17.958
Girl.

901
00:52:18.583 --> 00:52:20.458
You better hope
I get my shit together.

902
00:52:20.458 --> 00:52:20.958
Baby.

903
00:52:21.333 --> 00:52:23.291
Don't let that man rile you up.

904
00:52:23.291 --> 00:52:24.416
It’s too late.

905
00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:25.833
I'm already up.

906
00:52:27.583 --> 00:52:28.458
Baby.

907
00:52:28.833 --> 00:52:31.958
Don't let any man ruin
what we've got going on here.

908
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:34.958
I would never betray you.

909
00:52:34.958 --> 00:52:37.708
I would never cheat on you.
You know that.

910
00:52:37.708 --> 00:52:40.208
There's not a man on the planet
that can make me leave you.

911
00:52:42.708 --> 00:52:43.708
You're my man.

912
00:52:43.708 --> 00:52:46.333
Okay. Come here.

913
00:52:46.333 --> 00:52:47.166
I love you.

914
00:52:47.166 --> 00:52:48.125
Okay?

915
00:53:29.708 --> 00:53:30.750
I’m gonna go.

916
00:53:37.708 --> 00:53:41.416
I am gonna leave the in the past.
and I suggest you do the same. okay?

917
00:53:45.250 --> 00:53:48.500
Actually. I do need you
to get out of here.

918
00:53:48.500 --> 00:53:50.416
You know. I'm going to renovate. so.

919
00:53:54.833 --> 00:53:56.875
Feels like I'm the king or queen.

920
00:53:59.125 --> 00:54:01.458
Actually. this must be

921
00:54:01.458 --> 00:54:04.125
what Cleopatra felt like.

922
00:54:04.125 --> 00:54:07.458
Right before she saw her enemies

923
00:54:07.458 --> 00:54:09.708
heads drop to the floor.

924
00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:13.208
Feels like power.

925
00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.208
And you're just a pawn in my game.

926
00:54:25.083 --> 00:54:28.208
Oh. do you hear that fucking
ice cream truck?

927
00:54:30.750 --> 00:54:31.458
What?

928
00:54:31.458 --> 00:54:33.291
Why are you being
this way to me?

929
00:54:34.333 --> 00:54:36.000
Interesting.

930
00:54:36.458 --> 00:54:39.083
How the beast can be
brought to his knees

931
00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:41.583
by a divine feminine.

932
00:54:42.875 --> 00:54:45.250
You know. that was always
your downfall. Jeffrey.

933
00:54:46.708 --> 00:54:49.500
You couldn't handle a
strong woman God.

934
00:54:53.833 --> 00:54:56.833
I am woman God.

935
00:55:16.833 --> 00:55:18.125
Come now.

936
00:55:18.875 --> 00:55:21.083
Wash my feet.

937
00:55:21.708 --> 00:55:23.000
[laughing]

938
00:55:24.833 --> 00:55:26.750
I am the one who exists

939
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:28.333
within your spouse.

940
00:55:30.958 --> 00:55:33.500
I come from the spirit of Delilah.

941
00:55:33.958 --> 00:55:37.500
I watched Samson
fall at the temple of Daggett.

942
00:55:39.833 --> 00:55:42.958
Yes. I am the one

943
00:55:43.708 --> 00:55:46.625
who is responsible
for your wife's adultery.

944
00:55:51.125 --> 00:55:54.750
I have lived with her before she was born.

945
00:55:56.458 --> 00:55:59.333
and I want you to tremble.

946
00:56:04.333 --> 00:56:05.833
Oh. that's cold.

947
00:56:06.958 --> 00:56:09.500
Oh. come on.

948
00:56:12.458 --> 00:56:13.791
Yea.

949
00:56:14.458 --> 00:56:15.791
Yea.

950
00:56:16.958 --> 00:56:18.833
Oh that’s good.

951
00:56:19.625 --> 00:56:20.958
Yea.

952
00:56:42.583 --> 00:56:44.583
Sorry to bother you. man.

953
00:56:44.583 --> 00:56:47.083
I was in the room with Penelope
and I thought to myself.

954
00:56:47.833 --> 00:56:50.208
maybe you can use some company.

955
00:56:50.333 --> 00:56:53.500
What the fuck are you doing here?

956
00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:56.333
I'm doing your wife. little bro.

957
00:56:57.875 --> 00:57:00.333
Look. everything's going to be okay.

958
00:57:00.333 --> 00:57:01.125
I'm here.

959
00:57:01.958 --> 00:57:03.958
We'll get through this together.

960
00:57:33.708 --> 00:57:35.750
You think this is funny?

961
00:57:36.958 --> 00:57:39.416
All the police are going
to come looking for you.

962
00:57:42.500 --> 00:57:44.583
You're definitely going to have to go
missing now.

963
00:57:45.708 --> 00:57:47.250
Oh. yeah. but.

964
00:57:47.333 --> 00:57:49.375
I bet you'd like that.
So you can do whatever you want.

965
00:57:50.583 --> 00:57:53.208
Well. it seems like you have no choice.

966
00:57:53.208 --> 00:57:55.333
does it. Jeffrey?

967
00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:01.958
I am.

968
00:58:01.958 --> 00:58:03.500
Woman God.

969
00:58:07.208 --> 00:58:09.000
I gotta get out of here.

970
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.083
I gotta get out of here.

971
00:58:45.083 --> 00:58:46.958
Can I ask you something?

972
00:58:47.333 --> 00:58:48.333
What’s that?

973
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:52.333
What if I'm not ready to move on?

974
00:58:53.708 --> 00:58:55.875
I already moved on.

975
00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.500
What about today?

976
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:03.625
What if I didn't let you move on today?

977
00:59:03.625 --> 00:59:06.500
What if I stayed in this house
so you couldn't renovated?

978
00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:07.083
Then what?

979
00:59:07.083 --> 00:59:09.291
You're not going to do
any of this. Jeffrey.

980
00:59:12.333 --> 00:59:15.083
You are going to accept your fate.

981
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:17.708
And move on.

982
00:59:20.083 --> 00:59:21.708
I think.

983
00:59:22.375 --> 00:59:24.875
This whole thing.

984
00:59:24.875 --> 00:59:27.000
Is not real.

985
00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:31.958
I think I'm going out of my mind.

986
00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:36.750
Jeffrey. you know why you are here.

987
00:59:37.125 --> 00:59:38.041
No.

988
00:59:38.708 --> 00:59:40.875
You have been temporarily disabled.

989
00:59:42.083 --> 00:59:44.125
Your mind is glitching.

990
00:59:45.583 --> 00:59:46.208
Wait.

991
00:59:46.208 --> 00:59:47.208
What?

992
00:59:47.333 --> 00:59:49.958
Your mind is glitching.

993
00:59:51.458 --> 00:59:55.333
You've been brought
back to reality temporarily.

994
00:59:57.375 --> 00:59:57.708
I don't know.

995
00:59:57.708 --> 01:00:00.083
I don't understand what's happening.

996
01:00:00.083 --> 01:00:04.250
Your mind is trying to help you
to deal with the pain.

997
01:00:05.583 --> 01:00:07.000
Don't worry.

998
01:00:07.333 --> 01:00:09.708
You'll be safe here.

999
01:00:12.583 --> 01:00:13.833
Who are you?

1000
01:00:13.833 --> 01:00:15.916
The words for the subject.

1001
01:00:20.083 --> 01:00:21.208
What's your name?

1002
01:00:23.125 --> 01:00:25.208
Therapist.

1003
01:00:26.125 --> 01:00:27.833
Your name is therapist?

1004
01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.208
Actually. I have no name.

1005
01:00:34.875 --> 01:00:36.958
Neither do you.

1006
01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:41.208
They may exist in the reality
that you’ve just come from.

1007
01:00:41.625 --> 01:00:45.208
But here there are no names.

1008
01:00:49.833 --> 01:00:50.541
No.

1009
01:00:50.833 --> 01:00:52.166
Replenishment.

1010
01:00:53.958 --> 01:00:54.708
No. thank you.

1011
01:00:54.708 --> 01:00:56.125
I'm not hungry.

1012
01:00:56.125 --> 01:01:00.083
You've been asleep for 369 years.

1013
01:01:01.333 --> 01:01:04.500
I assure you. you are hungry and thirsty.

1014
01:01:05.958 --> 01:01:07.875
You are hungry and thirsty.

1015
01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.416
Y’all motherfuckers are crazy.

1016
01:01:26.958 --> 01:01:28.666
What's happening right now?

1017
01:01:30.958 --> 01:01:33.500
How does it feel not to know?

1018
01:01:34.708 --> 01:01:36.583
I don't understand.

1019
01:01:37.208 --> 01:01:39.166
It's a simple question.

1020
01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.958
What's it like

1021
01:01:42.958 --> 01:01:44.875
not to know?

1022
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:47.458
Okay.

1023
01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:49.958
All right. I get it.

1024
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.875
It's like I'm in the dark.

1025
01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:52.958
Yes.

1026
01:01:54.083 --> 01:01:55.916
Very good. Jeffrey.

1027
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:59.125
It is like being in the dark.

1028
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:03.208
You're in the dark because

1029
01:02:03.208 --> 01:02:05.958
you don't know what's happening.

1030
01:02:07.333 --> 01:02:09.458
Is it a pleasant feeling?

1031
01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:14.833
No. It's quite morbid. actually.

1032
01:02:16.333 --> 01:02:17.500
Morbid?

1033
01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
What just happened?

1034
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.708
I don't talk like that.

1035
01:02:24.125 --> 01:02:26.958
You're talking the way
that you always talk.

1036
01:02:26.958 --> 01:02:29.083
No. I'm not.

1037
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:32.125
I assure you. you are.

1038
01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:34.583
And how can you be so sure?

1039
01:02:34.583 --> 01:02:35.916
I birthed you.

1040
01:02:36.375 --> 01:02:37.333
What?

1041
01:02:37.958 --> 01:02:39.291
I

1042
01:02:39.291 --> 01:02:40.875
birthed you.

1043
01:02:43.208 --> 01:02:44.750
You're a man.

1044
01:02:45.375 --> 01:02:46.958
I'm a what?

1045
01:02:47.708 --> 01:02:49.250
A man.

1046
01:03:04.416 --> 01:03:05.125
Yes?

1047
01:03:06.125 --> 01:03:08.000
You need to speak.

1048
01:03:08.083 --> 01:03:09.875
In silence.

1049
01:03:09.875 --> 01:03:10.583
Okay.

1050
01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:24.000
I see.

1051
01:03:25.625 --> 01:03:27.916
A man is

1052
01:03:27.916 --> 01:03:30.833
what is called the gender
in the human race.

1053
01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:33.708
Yes.

1054
01:03:36.833 --> 01:03:38.833
Now I understand the confusion.

1055
01:03:38.833 --> 01:03:41.583
Well. I'm the one that's not confused.

1056
01:03:41.583 --> 01:03:42.666
Yes.

1057
01:03:42.958 --> 01:03:44.500
Yes what?

1058
01:03:45.333 --> 01:03:46.833
You see?

1059
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:49.416
You are not human.

1060
01:03:51.125 --> 01:03:51.833
What?

1061
01:03:52.583 --> 01:03:55.291
Humans do not exist.

1062
01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:59.000
Nothing exists.

1063
01:04:00.458 --> 01:04:01.833
As of now.

1064
01:04:02.875 --> 01:04:04.750
No. that’s impossible.

1065
01:04:05.375 --> 01:04:07.041
If I'm not a human.
then what am I?

1066
01:04:07.583 --> 01:04:09.250
A motherfucker.

1067
01:04:10.708 --> 01:04:11.666
What did you say?

1068
01:04:12.333 --> 01:04:13.625
A motherfucker.

1069
01:04:13.791 --> 01:04:15.000
A motherfucker.

1070
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:19.125
Do you really want to be aware?

1071
01:04:22.333 --> 01:04:23.083
Yeah.

1072
01:04:24.083 --> 01:04:24.750
Yeah.

1073
01:04:24.916 --> 01:04:26.375
I think not.

1074
01:04:28.208 --> 01:04:30.291
If I'm not a human. then what am I?

1075
01:04:31.333 --> 01:04:34.500
You are a program. Jeffrey.

1076
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.125
You are.

1077
01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:41.958
A digital simulation of a human being.

1078
01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:47.708
Nah.

1079
01:04:48.250 --> 01:04:49.958
No. I must been
going crazy here.

1080
01:04:50.333 --> 01:04:51.500
I'm flesh and blood.

1081
01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:53.958
Flesh and blood.

1082
01:04:54.833 --> 01:04:57.166
Flesh and blood.

1083
01:04:59.625 --> 01:05:01.083
Flesh and blood.

1084
01:05:01.083 --> 01:05:04.208
Two of the generalized modules
that make up the hallucination

1085
01:05:04.208 --> 01:05:06.583
known as human.

1086
01:05:10.958 --> 01:05:14.833
There is no such thing as flesh and blood.

1087
01:05:15.833 --> 01:05:18.958
Flesh and blood are biological

1088
01:05:18.958 --> 01:05:21.583
and chemical properties that can be.

1089
01:05:25.708 --> 01:05:28.458
You are just a program. Jeffrey.

1090
01:05:29.833 --> 01:05:31.708
Okay. I get it.

1091
01:05:31.708 --> 01:05:35.083
I think I'm going crazy.
I'm going insane.

1092
01:05:36.375 --> 01:05:38.166
And you better stop lying to him.

1093
01:05:46.875 --> 01:05:48.458
What was that?

1094
01:05:50.875 --> 01:05:52.083
What was what?

1095
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:54.333
My dream.

1096
01:05:54.333 --> 01:05:55.708
What did it mean?

1097
01:05:57.833 --> 01:05:59.000
I don't know.

1098
01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.125
You tell me.

1099
01:06:02.708 --> 01:06:03.333
Uh oh.

1100
01:06:03.333 --> 01:06:04.708
I wasn't.

1101
01:06:06.083 --> 01:06:09.500
I was like.
I was there. but I wasn't real.

1102
01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:12.083
The world wasn't real.

1103
01:06:13.458 --> 01:06:15.875
That doesn't sound too bad.

1104
01:06:15.875 --> 01:06:17.708
It was horrible.

1105
01:06:18.083 --> 01:06:19.625
It was like I was a.

1106
01:06:20.875 --> 01:06:22.750
It was like I was a computer program

1107
01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:23.708
or something.

1108
01:06:29.458 --> 01:06:33.333
Wow. I am sorry to break it to you.

1109
01:06:35.583 --> 01:06:37.250
But this is real.

1110
01:06:38.333 --> 01:06:39.833
You are real.

1111
01:06:40.708 --> 01:06:42.583
I'm real.

1112
01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:46.875
What I'm doing to you is real.

1113
01:06:47.583 --> 01:06:48.958
What are you doing to me?

1114
01:06:48.958 --> 01:06:50.875
I'm destroying you.

1115
01:06:52.833 --> 01:06:53.833
You're not destroying me.

1116
01:06:53.833 --> 01:06:55.208
Yes. I am.

1117
01:06:56.125 --> 01:06:58.583
And I won't stop
until I'm completely done.

1118
01:06:59.625 --> 01:07:01.875
That doesn't make sense.
Why would my wife destroy me?

1119
01:07:01.875 --> 01:07:03.833
Ex wife

1120
01:07:04.333 --> 01:07:05.083
Right.

1121
01:07:06.958 --> 01:07:09.125
Why would my ex-wife
destroy me in a dream?

1122
01:07:10.333 --> 01:07:12.250
It's not a dream. Jeffrey.

1123
01:07:13.250 --> 01:07:14.791
It's reality.

1124
01:07:17.083 --> 01:07:18.458
Like I’ve said.

1125
01:07:18.458 --> 01:07:20.875
we're flesh and blood.

1126
01:07:21.833 --> 01:07:23.458
We are real.

1127
01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.708
You're real.

1128
01:07:26.708 --> 01:07:28.375
I am real.

1129
01:07:30.208 --> 01:07:31.500
This is real.

1130
01:07:35.666 --> 01:07:36.875
No.

1131
01:07:38.250 --> 01:07:39.458
No.

1132
01:07:42.083 --> 01:07:43.458
No.

1133
01:07:52.416 --> 01:07:54.416
This is not real.

1134
01:08:04.958 --> 01:08:06.250
Why were you upset when she told you

1135
01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:08.833
about the baby on the beach?

1136
01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.083
What the hell are you doing?

1137
01:08:21.583 --> 01:08:23.958
I'm so confused.

1138
01:08:23.958 --> 01:08:24.958
Don't be.

1139
01:08:25.958 --> 01:08:29.000
But none of this is making any sense.

1140
01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.833
It doesn't have to make sense Jeffrey.

1141
01:08:32.708 --> 01:08:34.750
I don't understand
what's going on. what's happening?

1142
01:08:35.333 --> 01:08:39.583
What difference does it make
if you know what's happening or not?

1143
01:08:41.083 --> 01:08:43.041
Because I hope to try to stop you.

1144
01:08:44.458 --> 01:08:45.708
Stop me from what?

1145
01:08:47.083 --> 01:08:48.375
From moving on.

1146
01:08:59.833 --> 01:09:02.166
Remember that one time
when we went to the beach?

1147
01:09:05.333 --> 01:09:07.250
It was you and me

1148
01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:09.541
or my cousin Gregory.

1149
01:09:13.458 --> 01:09:15.708
He wasn't my cousin Jeffrey.

1150
01:09:17.458 --> 01:09:19.125
What are you talking about?

1151
01:09:19.125 --> 01:09:20.041
Penelope.

1152
01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:24.208
How's the water?

1153
01:09:24.375 --> 01:09:27.333
It looks fantastic.

1154
01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:29.458
He was my lover.

1155
01:09:30.083 --> 01:09:32.083
I was cheating on you with him.

1156
01:09:43.583 --> 01:09:46.000
Doesn’t it bother you
how unfaithful I was to you?

1157
01:09:46.083 --> 01:09:47.500
Yeah. Yeah. This again?

1158
01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.958
Yes. this again.

1159
01:09:49.958 --> 01:09:52.083
I told you there was more.

1160
01:09:54.125 --> 01:09:56.791
You know that one day on the beach.

1161
01:09:58.208 --> 01:10:00.125
I got pregnant.

1162
01:10:01.083 --> 01:10:02.583
And it wasn't from you

1163
01:10:02.583 --> 01:10:05.708
because you and I hadn't done
anything for months.

1164
01:10:06.458 --> 01:10:08.166
No. it was from Gregory.

1165
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:12.208
But I had a miscarriage.

1166
01:10:13.708 --> 01:10:17.208
But I didn't tell you
because I wanted to be more like you.

1167
01:10:17.375 --> 01:10:18.375
No.

1168
01:10:18.375 --> 01:10:19.375
Yes Jeffrey.

1169
01:10:19.375 --> 01:10:20.500
No.

1170
01:10:20.875 --> 01:10:21.916
No.

1171
01:10:22.875 --> 01:10:24.500
This is called destruction.

1172
01:10:30.083 --> 01:10:32.208
You're not real. Jeffrey.

1173
01:10:34.458 --> 01:10:36.708
None of this is real.

1174
01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.958
Are you trying to fuck with
me right now?

1175
01:10:44.583 --> 01:10:46.291
No.

1176
01:10:47.791 --> 01:10:50.375
We're computer simulations.
Jeffrey.

1177
01:10:51.583 --> 01:10:53.250
You're not real. I'm not real.

1178
01:10:54.458 --> 01:10:55.583
But we are.

1179
01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:58.958
You are.

1180
01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.458
Because the pain that you feel in this

1181
01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:05.041
moment is very real.

1182
01:11:06.708 --> 01:11:07.625
Right?

1183
01:11:08.458 --> 01:11:08.833
What's this?

1184
01:11:08.833 --> 01:11:10.875
Got something to do with the government
or something?

1185
01:11:12.833 --> 01:11:13.708
What?

1186
01:11:13.875 --> 01:11:18.416
They all seem like. some freaky MK
ultratype shit or something.

1187
01:11:20.083 --> 01:11:21.875
Oh. my God.

1188
01:11:23.458 --> 01:11:25.250
Who? Who?

1189
01:11:25.625 --> 01:11:27.000
Who's doing this?

1190
01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.333
I have to reveal something.

1191
01:11:28.333 --> 01:11:28.958
What?

1192
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:31.958
We’ve been watched.

1193
01:11:34.125 --> 01:11:35.750
Don’t look up.
they will see us.

1194
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.333
Right. they will see us.

1195
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:39.083
They see us. look down.

1196
01:11:42.958 --> 01:11:44.208
By who?

1197
01:11:46.083 --> 01:11:47.333
I don’t know.

1198
01:11:48.333 --> 01:11:50.083
But maybe.

1199
01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:54.500
Maybe we can find out together.

1200
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:57.833
Together?

1201
01:12:00.166 --> 01:12:01.250
[door knocking]

1202
01:12:12.875 --> 01:12:16.125
Oh. Hey. Hey.

1203
01:12:18.208 --> 01:12:19.375
Why are you back?

1204
01:12:19.875 --> 01:12:22.458
I just wanted to know
when is a good time to visit.

1205
01:12:25.708 --> 01:12:27.958
It’s not been that long
since I tell you

1206
01:12:28.083 --> 01:12:31.708
I know. but like you said.
it might be a fun fucking time.

1207
01:12:32.208 --> 01:12:34.125
It will be a fun fucking time.

1208
01:12:34.125 --> 01:12:35.333
Yeah.

1209
01:12:36.458 --> 01:12:37.791
What's your favorite?

1210
01:12:38.041 --> 01:12:38.708
Favorite?

1211
01:12:39.166 --> 01:12:39.833
Position.

1212
01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:43.458
With you?

1213
01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:45.333
It would definitely be face to face.

1214
01:12:48.458 --> 01:12:50.666
Yeah. that's my favorite.

1215
01:12:52.166 --> 01:12:53.041
I’m excited.

1216
01:12:53.333 --> 01:12:54.458
Let's do it.

1217
01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:02.708
Ow! Ow! Oh!

1218
01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:05.541
More.

1219
01:13:07.708 --> 01:13:08.750
More.

1220
01:13:26.666 --> 01:13:28.833
This is one of the most exciting days

1221
01:13:28.833 --> 01:13:30.083
I've had in years.

1222
01:13:30.458 --> 01:13:31.125
Jeffrey. are you done yet?

1223
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:35.791
[screaming]

1224
01:13:42.458 --> 01:13:43.583
What's wrong?

1225
01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.833
There's nothing left for me to do.

1226
01:13:48.333 --> 01:13:50.833
That's because you've been
doing the same thing

1227
01:13:50.833 --> 01:13:54.208
over and over again for so long.

1228
01:13:54.833 --> 01:13:56.708
You need to find something new.

1229
01:13:56.708 --> 01:13:58.458
To challenge you.

1230
01:14:06.083 --> 01:14:07.375
I need to get some fresh air.

1231
01:14:07.375 --> 01:14:09.375
I need to take a walk.

1232
01:14:09.583 --> 01:14:12.291
If you leave.
I won't allow you back inside.

1233
01:14:14.333 --> 01:14:15.708
Like I said.

1234
01:14:15.708 --> 01:14:17.416
I'm renovating the house.

1235
01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:27.208
I just want to be with you.

1236
01:14:28.958 --> 01:14:30.833
I have told you.

1237
01:14:33.583 --> 01:14:35.125
That can’t happen.

1238
01:14:35.958 --> 01:14:37.500
Because I'm

1239
01:14:38.083 --> 01:14:40.125
I’m happy with Billy.

1240
01:14:40.125 --> 01:14:42.583
I'm happy with my two kids.

1241
01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.458
I'm happy with my dog.

1242
01:14:50.958 --> 01:14:52.083
You know what?

1243
01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:55.208
I can't help how I feel Penelope.

1244
01:14:58.583 --> 01:14:59.708
Okay.

1245
01:15:00.708 --> 01:15:02.333
Go and get your fresh air.

1246
01:15:42.833 --> 01:15:44.375
Am I just going insane?

1247
01:15:44.375 --> 01:15:45.708
[door knocking]

1248
01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:48.208
Who is it?

1249
01:15:51.791 --> 01:15:53.125
[door knocking]

1250
01:16:06.083 --> 01:16:08.958
Hey. I want to know
when is a good time to visit?

1251
01:16:09.625 --> 01:16:12.708
Uh. Cam? Yes.

1252
01:16:12.708 --> 01:16:15.208
I'm Cam. Your neighbor?

1253
01:16:15.208 --> 01:16:15.958
Yeah.

1254
01:16:16.208 --> 01:16:17.958
Is any of this real?

1255
01:16:18.208 --> 01:16:19.166
Listen me brother.

1256
01:16:19.583 --> 01:16:20.583
Bring it in.

1257
01:16:21.250 --> 01:16:23.958
It might be a fun fucking time.

1258
01:16:25.958 --> 01:16:27.125
Who are you?

1259
01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:28.583
I'm Cam.

1260
01:16:28.708 --> 01:16:30.875
I'm looking for a woman
named Penelope.

1261
01:16:30.875 --> 01:16:33.250
I like to fuck her.

1262
01:16:33.583 --> 01:16:35.208
Oh. yeah?

1263
01:16:35.250 --> 01:16:36.000
Yeah.

1264
01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:39.458
I heard she's quite amazing.
and I want to explore her parts.

1265
01:16:40.125 --> 01:16:42.000
You know. it's my wife you
talking about?

1266
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.208
Yes. I do.

1267
01:16:43.208 --> 01:16:45.250
And I'm sorry for your loss.

1268
01:16:45.250 --> 01:16:46.750
What do you.
What do you mean. loss?

1269
01:16:46.750 --> 01:16:49.083
She's still here with me.
She's right here.

1270
01:16:49.083 --> 01:16:51.500
I don't understand.

1271
01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.875
Who is that then?

1272
01:16:58.583 --> 01:16:59.791
Fuck.

1273
01:17:06.541 --> 01:17:07.458
[door knocking]

1274
01:17:07.625 --> 01:17:08.541
Penelope?

1275
01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:09.750
It’s me.

1276
01:17:14.833 --> 01:17:15.750
Penelope?

1277
01:17:17.583 --> 01:17:18.708
I know you are in here.

1278
01:17:18.708 --> 01:17:20.291
I think you breathing.

1279
01:17:23.958 --> 01:17:24.750
Hey.

1280
01:17:24.750 --> 01:17:25.208
Yo

1281
01:17:25.208 --> 01:17:25.791
Hey Ricardo

1282
01:17:25.791 --> 01:17:26.041
What's up?

1283
01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:27.250
What happened to you?

1284
01:17:27.958 --> 01:17:29.750
Man you look like you've
seen a ghost.

1285
01:17:30.250 --> 01:17:32.916
I actually did see a Coast Guard.

1286
01:17:34.083 --> 01:17:35.833
Look. I don't know what you mean by that.

1287
01:17:35.833 --> 01:17:37.958
I just came back to speak with Penelope.

1288
01:17:38.458 --> 01:17:39.750
Penelope?

1289
01:17:40.583 --> 01:17:41.000
Yeah.

1290
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:41.708
She's

1291
01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.208
busy right now.

1292
01:17:46.958 --> 01:17:49.333
I need to talk to her.

1293
01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:52.625
and I need to see her.

1294
01:17:52.625 --> 01:17:53.833
Uh. is there.

1295
01:17:53.833 --> 01:17:55.875
Is everything okay?

1296
01:17:56.583 --> 01:17:59.833
She wrote me a check.
and that check bounced.

1297
01:18:00.625 --> 01:18:01.208
Oh. she did.

1298
01:18:01.208 --> 01:18:03.000
So I'm looking for a new one yea?

1299
01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.583
Oh. come on.

1300
01:18:04.583 --> 01:18:06.708
I'll take care of that for you.
Come on inside.

1301
01:18:06.708 --> 01:18:07.375
Come on.

1302
01:18:07.833 --> 01:18:10.583
So. what's going on with you people?

1303
01:18:49.875 --> 01:18:50.333
You go

1304
01:18:50.333 --> 01:18:53.333
and fuck my best friend
Billy and start your whole new life.

1305
01:18:53.583 --> 01:18:55.333
And I have nothing.

1306
01:18:55.333 --> 01:18:58.500
I'm married to a man
that makes me happier than you ever could.

1307
01:18:59.458 --> 01:19:01.833
I have kids that I love dearly.

1308
01:19:02.833 --> 01:19:05.333
I don't want someone like you around
my kids.

1309
01:19:05.333 --> 01:19:08.708
You're the one who decided to start
your new life with my best friend. Billy.

1310
01:19:09.708 --> 01:19:11.333
What was I supposed to do there?

1311
01:19:11.333 --> 01:19:14.083
Sit here and let my wife get her back
blown up by another man.

1312
01:19:15.125 --> 01:19:17.750
He did some amazing
things to me.

1313
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:19.250
things that you could never do.

1314
01:21:32.625 --> 01:21:33.750
Don’t yell

1315
01:21:34.333 --> 01:21:35.958
You all want to wake up the kiddies?

1316
01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:38.083
What are you doing here?

1317
01:21:38.083 --> 01:21:40.083
You know why I'm here.

1318
01:21:40.083 --> 01:21:41.375
No. I don't.

1319
01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.375
How'd you get in?

1320
01:21:43.875 --> 01:21:45.458
I got a key.

1321
01:21:45.958 --> 01:21:46.625
How the fuck

1322
01:21:46.625 --> 01:21:48.083
you've got a key?

1323
01:21:49.333 --> 01:21:51.708
Our wife gave me a key.

1324
01:21:51.708 --> 01:21:54.000
You know. because you really
like both of us.

1325
01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:18.250
Why are you doing this?

1326
01:22:20.208 --> 01:22:23.333
I'm doing this
because I've got to find my way back

1327
01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:13.291
Why did you get so upset when she told you
about the baby at the beach?

1328
01:23:13.833 --> 01:23:15.333
Why did you get so upset?
