3
00:00:15.265 --> 00:00:16.767
We have to write an essay?

4
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.438
Five hundred words about who we are?

5
00:00:21.522 --> 00:00:26.068
I have no idea who I am.
How am I gonna come up with 500 words?

6
00:00:26.652 --> 00:00:28.278
That will take forever.

7
00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:33.116
Due in one week? Good grief.

8
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.787
I couldn't be stuck
with a worse subject: me.

9
00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:40.624
You worry too much. Charlie Brown.

10
00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.795
Good ol' Charlie Brown.

11
00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:48.507
the lovable loser
who never seems to catch a break.

12
00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:53.220
You've probably heard of him.
You've definitely seen him.

13
00:00:54.137 --> 00:00:55.639
He's been everywhere.

14
00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.103
In newspapers and books. movies and TV.

15
00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:04.565
He's been all over the world
and up in the air.

16
00:01:05.147 --> 00:01:08.485
-He's even been to the moon.
-Good grief. Charlie Brown.

17
00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:11.864
It sort of feels like
Charlie Brown. his dog. Snoopy.

18
00:01:11.947 --> 00:01:15.868
and the rest of the Peanuts Gang
have pretty much always been around.

19
00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.121
Linus. I always had a special feeling for.

20
00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:22.499
-My favorite character is Linus.
-I'm a Woodstock fan.

21
00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:24.960
It was amazing how much Franklin
meant to me.

22
00:01:25.043 --> 00:01:27.880
My favorite Peanuts character
is Peppermint Patty.

23
00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:31.383
-Yeah. and Snoopy.
-Of course. I like Snoopy the best.

24
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:35.512
For 70 years.
Peanuts has been part of our lives.

25
00:01:35.596 --> 00:01:38.515
Like. Peanuts is just its own planet.

26
00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:40.392
The audience is the world.

27
00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:43.854
It appeals to everyone. and that's why
it became this huge phenomenon.

28
00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:47.024
Peanuts may be a global icon.

29
00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:51.236
but at the center of it all
is still good ol' Charlie Brown.

30
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.031
I love Peanuts. and I love Charlie Brown.

31
00:01:54.114 --> 00:01:55.991
I love Charlie Brown.

32
00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:58.535
I related to Charlie Brown so much.

33
00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:01.663
But who is Charlie Brown really?

34
00:02:01.747 --> 00:02:03.373
And where did he come from?

35
00:02:03.457 --> 00:02:07.628
Why would anybody care about who I am?
I'm nobody special.

36
00:02:15.177 --> 00:02:17.763
"Who Are You. Charlie Brown?"

37
00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:26.772
Long before
there was a boy named Charlie Brown.

38
00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:32.110
there was a man named Charles Schulz
who had dreamed of being a cartoonist.

39
00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:34.655
I always dreamed I'd have a comic strip.

40
00:02:34.738 --> 00:02:38.492
I think I've been dreaming about this
thing since I was about six years old.

41
00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.786
Almost from the moment he was born.

42
00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:44.331
it seemed like Charles Schulz
was destined to be in the comics.

43
00:02:44.414 --> 00:02:45.916
When he was a baby.

44
00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.377
one of his uncles called him Spark Plug.

45
00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.755
which came from Spark Plug the horse.
a comic strip character.

46
00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:54.883
So. everybody called him Sparky.

47
00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:56.885
He was an only child.

48
00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:01.181
and he was the little kid
that no one really talked to.

49
00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:02.891
He was so painfully shy

50
00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:06.228
that when he and his mother
would walk down the street in Saint Paul.

51
00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:07.563
he'd walk with his head down.

52
00:03:07.646 --> 00:03:10.524
Shy little Sparky did so well in school

53
00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:11.984
that he skipped a grade.

54
00:03:12.067 --> 00:03:14.778
But that really wasn't
all it was cracked up to be.

55
00:03:14.862 --> 00:03:19.324
He was the youngest person
in the room by a year.

56
00:03:19.408 --> 00:03:21.660
which when you're a kid is a big deal.

57
00:03:21.743 --> 00:03:26.957
And it was hard to keep up
with the older kids. He was miserable.

58
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.628
He just felt as if he didn't mean anything
to the rest of the kids in school.

59
00:03:31.712 --> 00:03:35.799
After school. Sparky liked to
hang out in his father's barbershop.

60
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.220
"When I'm real lonesome.
I like to go to my dad's barbershop.

61
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:43.390
They always ask if I've come in
for a shave."

62
00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.185
But even that had its downside.

63
00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:49.605
When I used to go into the shop.
and he'd be working on me.

64
00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:54.026
the embarrassing thing about that was
maybe he'd be halfway through my haircut.

65
00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.320
and a real good customer would come in.

66
00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:59.072
And he would say.
"Why don't you just sit over there

67
00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:02.034
and wait for a little bit
because I have to wait on this man."

68
00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:05.996
It was so embarrassing to sit on the bench
with just a half a haircut.

69
00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:08.332
By the time he was in middle school.

70
00:04:08.415 --> 00:04:11.001
even Sparky's good grades
were starting to slip.

71
00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.212
and he felt like a total failure.

72
00:04:13.295 --> 00:04:16.339
I think it was
in the eighth grade when the roof fell in.

73
00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.800
I failed everything
there was possible to fail.

74
00:04:19.301 --> 00:04:21.720
One place where Sparky found happiness

75
00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.347
was in his sketchbook.

76
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.392
He drew all the time. and he dreamed
that someday he would draw comics

77
00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:29.853
like the ones he read in the newspaper.

78
00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:33.148
We subscribed to two papers
in Saint Paul. and on Saturday night.

79
00:04:33.232 --> 00:04:36.068
my dad would drive up
to the local drugstore

80
00:04:36.151 --> 00:04:40.072
and buy the two Minneapolis papers so
we could get four comic sections to read.

81
00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:43.075
And that was what life was about to me.

82
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.714
Five hundred words about who I am.
Who am I. Snoopy?

83
00:04:57.798 --> 00:04:59.299
I'm the son of a barber.

84
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.972
I like baseball. I go to school.
I just try to make it through the day.

85
00:05:05.597 --> 00:05:07.808
This assignment is impossible.

86
00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:15.065
You wouldn't understand. Snoopy.
You never have to do anything difficult.

87
00:05:15.566 --> 00:05:18.402
Sit. stay. roll over.

88
00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:20.988
A dog's life is so simple.

89
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.978
"Sparky Goes to War!"

90
00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:39.983
In 1942. Sparky was drafted into the army.

91
00:06:40.734 --> 00:06:43.070
"What happens when you get drafted?"

92
00:06:43.153 --> 00:06:45.197
"They send you someplace."

93
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.282
"That's what I was afraid of."

94
00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:55.123
Leaving home was heartbreaking for Sparky.

95
00:06:55.207 --> 00:06:59.586
He was very close to his mother.
and she had been sick for a long time.

96
00:07:00.087 --> 00:07:03.590
Sparky was never told
how ill his mother was.

97
00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:08.804
And that she probably wasn't
going to make it.

98
00:07:09.388 --> 00:07:15.102
And he felt very left out and isolated
because of that.

99
00:07:15.686 --> 00:07:18.814
The night that I had to
report back to Fort Snelling

100
00:07:18.897 --> 00:07:21.650
in Minnesota. she said.
"I think we should say goodbye

101
00:07:21.733 --> 00:07:25.362
because we will probably never
see each other again."

102
00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:27.072
And off I went.

103
00:07:27.155 --> 00:07:29.700
He would get very depressed.
visibly shaken.

104
00:07:29.783 --> 00:07:31.785
when he talked about
the death of his mother.

105
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:34.204
Really did reduce him to tears.

106
00:07:34.788 --> 00:07:41.211
It left him. probably. with something
that he thought about all his life.

107
00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:44.131
"It's all very strange.

108
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:48.260
You can be walking along.
not thinking of anything in particular.

109
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.263
Suddenly.
you're reminded of a lost love..."

110
00:07:52.139 --> 00:07:53.140
Ten-hut!

111
00:07:53.223 --> 00:07:56.268
I don't know how
I ever survived those days though.

112
00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.603
It's a long time ago.

113
00:07:57.686 --> 00:08:00.647
but those are some things
that you just never forget.

114
00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:14.203
Young Sparky had never spent
a single night away from home.

115
00:08:14.286 --> 00:08:15.537
But during the war.

116
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:18.707
he traveled all the way
to France and Germany.

117
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:23.754
Throughout his time in the service.
Sparky was often homesick and lonely.

118
00:08:23.837 --> 00:08:27.508
so he drew pictures.
just as he had when he was a kid.

119
00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:30.219
He brought his sketchbook
everywhere he went.

120
00:08:30.302 --> 00:08:33.804
And when the war was over.
he came home more determined than ever

121
00:08:33.889 --> 00:08:35.765
to make it as a cartoonist.

122
00:08:40.604 --> 00:08:43.815
Big brother.
I need help with my math homework.

123
00:08:44.316 --> 00:08:46.652
Can't you see I'm busy writing my essay?

124
00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.195
What's it about?

125
00:08:48.278 --> 00:08:49.988
It's about who I am.

126
00:08:50.489 --> 00:08:52.950
Who you are? I'll tell you who you are.

127
00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.743
You're my big brother.

128
00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:56.620
And you're a lousy big brother

129
00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:59.206
if you don't help me
with my math homework.

130
00:08:59.915 --> 00:09:01.917
Here. take a look at this.

131
00:09:02.876 --> 00:09:04.086
Good grief.

132
00:09:04.753 --> 00:09:09.508
Okay. If you have two apples.
and I give you three more.

133
00:09:09.591 --> 00:09:11.426
how many apples do you have?

134
00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:13.595
Who cares?

135
00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:16.473
I've never eaten more than
one apple at a time.

136
00:09:16.557 --> 00:09:19.184
And who's handing out
all these apples anyway?

137
00:09:20.394 --> 00:09:22.855
I guess my essay
will have to wait until later.

138
00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:31.488
Sparky wanted to be
a cartoonist more than anything.

139
00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:35.075
Just like Charlie Brown.
he kept on trying.

140
00:09:35.576 --> 00:09:39.037
And just like Charlie Brown.
he kept on failing.

141
00:09:40.038 --> 00:09:43.500
I would send in ten cartoons
to The Saturday Evening Post.

142
00:09:43.584 --> 00:09:46.295
While they were out.
I'd be working on my comic strip.

143
00:09:46.378 --> 00:09:49.798
And when I mailed in the comic strip.
I'd be working on something else.

144
00:09:49.882 --> 00:09:53.093
Sparky was able
to get a few of his cartoons published.

145
00:09:53.177 --> 00:09:56.263
but they didn't have Charlie Brown
or Snoopy in them yet.

146
00:09:56.346 --> 00:09:59.099
Now. you always think
that the first sale you make

147
00:09:59.183 --> 00:10:02.102
is gonna open up everything to you.
but it doesn't work that way.

148
00:10:02.186 --> 00:10:05.606
I sold two or three and then. suddenly.
I couldn't sell any for months.

149
00:10:05.689 --> 00:10:09.318
For five years. Sparky tried and failed.

150
00:10:09.401 --> 00:10:12.112
And then he started to realize something.

151
00:10:12.196 --> 00:10:15.073
He drew this comic strip called
Li'l Folks.

152
00:10:15.574 --> 00:10:17.784
which featured a character
called Charlie Brown

153
00:10:17.868 --> 00:10:22.456
and featured a dog that didn't quite
look like Snoopy but was close enough.

154
00:10:23.415 --> 00:10:27.127
I discovered. little by little.
that when I drew little kids.

155
00:10:27.211 --> 00:10:31.632
these seemed to be the type of cartoons
that editors liked the best.

156
00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:34.176
His work was finally starting to catch on.

157
00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:36.637
And one day in 1950.

158
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.474
Sparky published
his first Peanuts comic strip.

159
00:10:40.557 --> 00:10:44.228
The first strip that
ever appeared showed three characters.

160
00:10:44.311 --> 00:10:49.149
One of them was a little girl named Patty.
and another was a little boy named Shermy.

161
00:10:49.233 --> 00:10:52.945
And Charlie Brown was in the strip.
and he came walking by in front of them.

162
00:10:53.028 --> 00:10:56.823
There he is. There goes Charlie Brown.
"Good ol' Charlie Brown."

163
00:10:56.907 --> 00:10:59.743
Then as soon as he's gone.
he's like. "Boy. how I hate him."

164
00:11:00.619 --> 00:11:02.913
Like. it's so--

165
00:11:02.996 --> 00:11:05.290
That's harsh. right?

166
00:11:05.374 --> 00:11:07.876
But that's childhood.

167
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.296
Kids are rough. It's like
the way kids treat each other

168
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:15.717
is what sort of helps inform you
to build up your armor.

169
00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:18.136
And then you have to spend
the rest of your life

170
00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.180
remembering to take off the armor.

171
00:11:20.264 --> 00:11:23.308
Before long. people all over America

172
00:11:23.392 --> 00:11:26.103
were falling in love
with good ol' Charlie Brown.

173
00:11:26.186 --> 00:11:28.730
Here's a character I can relate to

174
00:11:28.814 --> 00:11:33.402
who's clearly as nerdy
or just as not accepted as I am.

175
00:11:33.485 --> 00:11:36.864
or as I feel. That was a huge thing.

176
00:11:36.947 --> 00:11:40.576
We would see Charlie Brown being bullied.

177
00:11:40.659 --> 00:11:45.622
You'd root for Charlie Brown because
he was so painfully human.

178
00:11:45.706 --> 00:11:47.541
He keeps going even when it gets tough.

179
00:11:47.624 --> 00:11:51.587
He gets right back up and tries again.
So that's. like. really cool to me.

180
00:11:51.670 --> 00:11:54.882
Sparky's dream was finally coming true.

181
00:11:54.965 --> 00:11:57.384
and he did it by just being himself.

182
00:11:57.467 --> 00:11:59.344
This whole business about Charlie Brown.

183
00:11:59.428 --> 00:12:02.264
These are memories
of my own miserable days.

184
00:12:02.347 --> 00:12:08.562
I think Charlie Brown is just a little bit
of what all of us have inside of us.

185
00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:11.523
Mainly me. Mainly. I'm Charlie Brown.

186
00:12:17.029 --> 00:12:18.071
Linus.

187
00:12:18.155 --> 00:12:21.700
how am I supposed to come up with
500 words about myself?

188
00:12:22.201 --> 00:12:25.162
There's nothing about me
that's worth writing down.

189
00:12:25.245 --> 00:12:28.165
This assignment is actually
a great opportunity for you.

190
00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:29.458
Charlie Brown.

191
00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:31.168
An opportunity for what?

192
00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:36.089
It's a chance to ask yourself
some of life's most essential questions.

193
00:12:36.173 --> 00:12:40.552
Who am I? Why am I here?
What is my purpose in the world?

194
00:12:40.636 --> 00:12:44.431
Good grief. How am I supposed to
figure out all of that?

195
00:12:44.515 --> 00:12:48.143
Well. Charlie Brown.
when I'm faced with difficult questions.

196
00:12:48.227 --> 00:12:50.729
I look to the great minds of history.

197
00:12:50.812 --> 00:12:54.608
The Spanish novelist
Miguel de Cervantes once wrote.

198
00:12:54.691 --> 00:12:58.362
"Tell me what company you keep.
and I'll tell you what you are."

199
00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:02.908
What company I keep? What does that mean?

200
00:13:02.991 --> 00:13:05.661
It means you should look to your friends.
Charlie Brown.

201
00:13:05.744 --> 00:13:09.122
The people you spend your time with.
Maybe they can help.

202
00:13:09.623 --> 00:13:13.418
I don't know. Linus. It seems impossible.

203
00:13:13.502 --> 00:13:15.045
Cheer up. Charlie Brown.

204
00:13:15.128 --> 00:13:19.758
You have a whole week to find the answers
to life's most fundamental questions.

205
00:13:23.428 --> 00:13:26.640
Sparky always said
he was a lot like Charlie Brown.

206
00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:30.978
but there's actually a bit of Sparky
in almost all the Peanuts characters.

207
00:13:32.896 --> 00:13:34.606
He was exactly the person

208
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.984
you would hope
the creator of Peanuts would be.

209
00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:40.153
He is sort of all his characters
in one person.

210
00:13:40.237 --> 00:13:43.156
Linus is the philosophical part
of Mr. Schulz.

211
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.535
You know. has the philosophy.
has something to say.

212
00:13:46.618 --> 00:13:49.997
He's quietly philosophical.
That's kinda what Sparky was like.

213
00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:53.458
Linus is always asking these
bigger questions about

214
00:13:53.542 --> 00:13:58.130
the meaning of life and our place in
the universe and how it all fits together.

215
00:13:58.213 --> 00:14:01.133
"Life is difficult. isn't it.
Charlie Brown?"

216
00:14:01.216 --> 00:14:06.221
I think I related to Linus because of--
Well. I had a security blanket.

217
00:14:06.305 --> 00:14:09.266
I used to. like.
also carry around a blue blanket.

218
00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.435
so I just really relate to him.

219
00:14:12.102 --> 00:14:14.438
I. too. had a blankie.

220
00:14:15.189 --> 00:14:18.150
And I used to stand
in front of the washer-dryer

221
00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:20.652
at the Laundromat my mom went to.

222
00:14:20.736 --> 00:14:25.532
crying on the wash cycle.
and then crying on the dryer cycle.

223
00:14:25.616 --> 00:14:27.826
And so everybody called me Linus.

224
00:14:28.994 --> 00:14:31.371
Linus can be very smart. He can be dumb.

225
00:14:31.455 --> 00:14:33.498
He can be innocent. He can be all-knowing.

226
00:14:34.166 --> 00:14:38.504
The nature of his personality
lends himself to all sorts of ideas.

227
00:14:38.587 --> 00:14:42.674
Linus and Charlie Brown showed
the sweet side of Sparky's personality.

228
00:14:43.342 --> 00:14:46.595
Linus's big sister. Lucy.
on the other hand...

229
00:14:46.678 --> 00:14:48.347
Lucy's really mean.

230
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:51.391
"You're a very boring person.
Charlie Brown."

231
00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:54.228
And loud and kind of scary.

232
00:14:54.311 --> 00:14:57.397
Lucy is funny. but she's really mean.

233
00:14:57.481 --> 00:15:00.359
Most of us don't like Lucy
'cause she's so mean.

234
00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:01.610
But at the same time.

235
00:15:01.693 --> 00:15:05.280
she's so over-the-top mean
that it's kinda funny.

236
00:15:05.364 --> 00:15:07.950
Everybody knows
what Lucy with the football means.

237
00:15:08.033 --> 00:15:11.119
Charlie Brown's. like. running.
and Lucy pulls away the football.

238
00:15:11.203 --> 00:15:12.955
and he screams and he falls on his back.

239
00:15:14.331 --> 00:15:15.415
Classic.

240
00:15:18.293 --> 00:15:21.338
Which of the characters
do I feel in closest sympathy with?

241
00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:24.466
I like them all because each one
is probably a little bit of myself.

242
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:27.678
The sarcastic part of me belongs to Lucy.

243
00:15:27.761 --> 00:15:30.472
The wishy-washy part of me
belongs to Charlie Brown.

244
00:15:31.056 --> 00:15:33.350
And the dreamer belongs.
of course. to Snoopy.

245
00:15:36.687 --> 00:15:38.021
Snoopy.

246
00:15:38.522 --> 00:15:42.234
While Charlie Brown and the other kids
were a bit like Sparky himself.

247
00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:44.987
the sky was the limit with Snoopy.

248
00:15:45.070 --> 00:15:48.532
Snoopy was a dog who refused to be a dog.

249
00:15:48.615 --> 00:15:50.993
and he was very aspirational. right?

250
00:15:51.076 --> 00:15:56.081
Oh. my God. I love Snoopy.
He's so cute and so funny.

251
00:15:56.164 --> 00:15:58.375
Everyone loves Snoopy
because he represented

252
00:15:58.458 --> 00:16:00.252
what I think we all wanted to be.

253
00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:03.255
You go. "Okay. today.
I'm pretending I'm a World War flying ace.

254
00:16:03.338 --> 00:16:06.967
Tomorrow. I'm pretending I'm
a movie star." Whatever it is.

255
00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:09.678
Snoopy kinda lives his own life
and has all these fantasies.

256
00:16:09.761 --> 00:16:14.057
But even Snoopy came from
someplace in Sparky's life that was real.

257
00:16:14.141 --> 00:16:16.643
Snoopy really is based upon
a dog that I had

258
00:16:16.727 --> 00:16:18.604
when I was about 13 years old.

259
00:16:18.687 --> 00:16:22.482
There's a reason Snoopy played hockey
and ice-skated. 'cause Schulz did as well.

260
00:16:22.566 --> 00:16:24.359
So. like all the best creators.

261
00:16:24.443 --> 00:16:26.862
there's a lot of himself in the work.

262
00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:30.282
that you can kind of see
in what the characters speak about

263
00:16:30.365 --> 00:16:32.284
and the things they're also fans of.

264
00:16:41.752 --> 00:16:44.171
I've gotta get a good grade on this essay.

265
00:16:45.005 --> 00:16:47.174
Maybe I should talk to a professional.

266
00:16:50.802 --> 00:16:54.473
Hi. Charlie Brown.
What seems to be the problem today?

267
00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:57.392
I'm having trouble
writing my essay for class. Lucy.

268
00:16:57.476 --> 00:16:58.644
Can you help?

269
00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:02.564
Absolutely. I've actually thought a lot
about you and your imperfections.

270
00:17:02.648 --> 00:17:06.777
My imperfections? I'm not sure
that is going to help with my--

271
00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:07.861
Listen. Charlie Brown.

272
00:17:07.944 --> 00:17:09.780
There's no better way to learn who you are

273
00:17:09.863 --> 00:17:12.657
than to have your many faults
pointed out by a professional.

274
00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:14.576
My many faults?

275
00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.827
Exactly.

276
00:17:15.911 --> 00:17:20.207
And I've created a proprietary system that
I think you'll find very enlightening.

277
00:17:23.292 --> 00:17:25.337
Make yourself comfortable. Charlie Brown.

278
00:17:25.838 --> 00:17:29.591
I've prepared a few hundred slides
to illustrate your many flaws and foibles.

279
00:17:31.343 --> 00:17:32.427
Lights. please.

280
00:17:41.895 --> 00:17:44.189
Let's start with your early years.

281
00:17:45.107 --> 00:17:48.110
As you can see. from the very beginning.

282
00:17:48.193 --> 00:17:50.279
you were not well-liked.

283
00:17:51.113 --> 00:17:52.948
Popularity eluded you.

284
00:17:55.033 --> 00:17:58.036
You never really measured up
to your peers.

285
00:17:58.954 --> 00:17:59.955
See?

286
00:18:00.831 --> 00:18:02.040
Now. pay attention.

287
00:18:03.458 --> 00:18:06.545
If we dig deeper.
we'll see that a pattern emerges.

288
00:18:06.628 --> 00:18:09.089
a pattern of repeated failure.

289
00:18:12.092 --> 00:18:13.552
Under your management.

290
00:18:13.635 --> 00:18:17.389
your baseball team has lost every game
you've ever played.

291
00:18:17.472 --> 00:18:20.100
Well. we've won a few times.

292
00:18:20.184 --> 00:18:23.270
Yes. but that was only
when you broke your arm.

293
00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:27.941
Continuing with the sports theme.

294
00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:32.112
you've never managed to kick a football.
ever.

295
00:18:33.614 --> 00:18:34.615
See?

296
00:18:35.407 --> 00:18:39.077
Even when you're not playing
a team sport. you still fail.

297
00:18:41.038 --> 00:18:43.290
You fail alone and with others.

298
00:18:44.333 --> 00:18:47.044
Now. let's take a look at Valentine's Day.

299
00:18:50.464 --> 00:18:53.300
Enough! I can't take it anymore.

300
00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:01.475
I hope I helped with your essay!
Expect an itemized bill in a few days!

301
00:19:03.769 --> 00:19:07.940
Failure. failure. failure.

302
00:19:09.274 --> 00:19:12.945
Sparky got most of his ideas
for Charlie Brown from his own childhood.

303
00:19:15.072 --> 00:19:16.657
But once he had kids of his own.

304
00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:19.868
their childhoods
started to make their way into Peanuts.

305
00:19:19.952 --> 00:19:24.373
I think I probably get more ideas
from watching my own kids

306
00:19:24.456 --> 00:19:28.377
than I probably really
would like to admit.

307
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:32.005
Just watching the little arguments that
they go through and this sort of thing

308
00:19:32.089 --> 00:19:34.091
has given me quite a few ideas.

309
00:19:34.174 --> 00:19:38.846
The only stuff that really resonates
in entertainment. I feel.

310
00:19:38.929 --> 00:19:42.224
is when it's coming from
a very singular point of view.

311
00:19:42.307 --> 00:19:47.521
And the only point of view any creator has
is his or her own point of view.

312
00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:51.567
Even as a kid. I was. like.
cognizant of the fact that

313
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:54.111
there is a man somewhere in America

314
00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:58.782
who sits at a large slanted desk.
and he's got a wife and kids.

315
00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:01.910
And he gets up. he draws Snoopy.
and then he goes ice-skating.

316
00:20:01.994 --> 00:20:04.371
One of the boys
was making model airplanes.

317
00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:06.331
and he was showing me the latest model.

318
00:20:06.415 --> 00:20:09.918
And all of a sudden. it occurred to me.
why not put Snoopy on the doghouse

319
00:20:10.002 --> 00:20:12.629
and let him pretend
he's a World War I flying ace?

320
00:20:12.713 --> 00:20:15.966
He was listening to Craig.
his other son. one day.

321
00:20:16.049 --> 00:20:18.260
and a young man walked by. and Craig said.

322
00:20:18.343 --> 00:20:20.679
"That guy acts like Joe Cool."

323
00:20:20.762 --> 00:20:22.389
Joe Cool started.

324
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:27.060
Everything in the comic strip
had something personal to Sparky.

325
00:20:27.144 --> 00:20:32.232
If he wrote about a symphony
that Schroeder was playing.

326
00:20:32.316 --> 00:20:34.234
that was a symphony that he loved.

327
00:20:34.776 --> 00:20:36.236
He took a lot from his life.

328
00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.865
You always wondered what he was observing
if you were ever around him.

329
00:20:39.948 --> 00:20:44.661
I remember I called him my sweet babboo.
Pretty soon it was in the comic strip...

330
00:20:44.745 --> 00:20:48.415
"And this is a very special one
for my 'sweet babboo.'"

331
00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:53.378
...and became something
that Sally tormented Linus with.

332
00:20:53.462 --> 00:20:56.089
"I'm not your sweet babboo."

333
00:20:56.173 --> 00:20:58.800
"Pigpen."
What does that phrase mean to you?

334
00:20:58.884 --> 00:21:03.722
"Pigpen" came from a friend of mine who
used to call his children by funny names.

335
00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:06.391
And I can remember. his little boy
was running around the living room.

336
00:21:06.475 --> 00:21:07.893
and he says. "Go to bed. Pigpen."

337
00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:11.313
And I thought that would make a good title
for a comic character.

338
00:21:11.396 --> 00:21:15.275
Here's this character who
seems like he should be a laughingstock.

339
00:21:15.359 --> 00:21:16.818
And occasionally other characters.

340
00:21:16.902 --> 00:21:20.197
they come over to Pigpen and they say.
"You should be ashamed of yourself."

341
00:21:20.781 --> 00:21:23.450
"You know what he looks like?" "What?"

342
00:21:23.951 --> 00:21:26.161
"A human soil bank."

343
00:21:26.245 --> 00:21:30.582
And he'll have none of it.
There's this dignity to Pigpen.

344
00:21:30.666 --> 00:21:33.043
As a young transgendered kid.

345
00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:35.462
I think maybe that's a thing
that I was drawn to.

346
00:21:45.889 --> 00:21:48.267
Lucy sure wasn't very helpful.

347
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.644
I think I need a second opinion.

348
00:21:51.562 --> 00:21:56.191
Ninety-seven. 98. 99. 100.

349
00:21:56.275 --> 00:21:57.484
My turn.

350
00:22:02.447 --> 00:22:03.574
Pigpen!

351
00:22:05.701 --> 00:22:07.327
You're making a mess.

352
00:22:24.928 --> 00:22:28.348
Hi. Charlie Brown.
Do you wanna help me make mud pies?

353
00:22:28.432 --> 00:22:33.270
I don't think I can. Pigpen.
I have to work on a school project.

354
00:22:33.353 --> 00:22:35.856
Hey! Come jump rope with us!

355
00:22:35.939 --> 00:22:38.734
Oh. no.
That little red-haired girl is coming.

356
00:22:41.737 --> 00:22:43.697
What's the matter. Charlie Brown?

357
00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:46.700
-I can't let her see me.
-Why not?

358
00:22:47.284 --> 00:22:49.286
What if she doesn't like what she sees?

359
00:22:49.828 --> 00:22:53.040
I think what's more important
is how you see yourself.

360
00:22:53.123 --> 00:22:55.542
I like myself no matter what people think.

361
00:22:56.251 --> 00:23:00.631
Really?
Even if they think you're... filthy?

362
00:23:01.131 --> 00:23:06.136
Well. I don't see myself as filthy.
I see myself as a part of history.

363
00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:09.723
covered with the dust and dirt
of countless ages.

364
00:23:09.806 --> 00:23:12.392
Guess I just don't have your confidence.
Pigpen.

365
00:23:13.393 --> 00:23:16.396
I better go
before the little red-haired girl sees me.

366
00:23:18.982 --> 00:23:20.567
Poor Charlie Brown.

367
00:23:27.574 --> 00:23:29.117
Just like Charlie Brown.

368
00:23:29.201 --> 00:23:33.205
in real life.
Sparky had his own little red-haired girl.

369
00:23:33.705 --> 00:23:38.126
As a young man. Sparky met Donna Wold.
the little red-headed girl.

370
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:41.713
and fell head over heels in love with her.

371
00:23:41.797 --> 00:23:45.384
And Donna was engaged to marry a fireman.

372
00:23:45.467 --> 00:23:49.012
and she wasn't sure about this fireman.

373
00:23:49.096 --> 00:23:53.058
And she broke up with him.
and she went out with Sparky.

374
00:23:54.601 --> 00:23:57.187
I had the high hopes
that she would marry me.

375
00:23:59.106 --> 00:24:00.315
But she didn't.

376
00:24:00.816 --> 00:24:03.902
I think that he thought.
"Well. if I work hard enough.

377
00:24:03.986 --> 00:24:06.029
if I'm this and I'm that and--

378
00:24:06.113 --> 00:24:08.782
She'll forget the fireman
and stick with me."

379
00:24:08.866 --> 00:24:12.494
But. nope. she made up her mind
and she married the fireman.

380
00:24:12.578 --> 00:24:18.625
I gave her my complete devotion.
my heart. and she walked away.

381
00:24:19.459 --> 00:24:23.463
I didn't deal with it very well.
I dreamed about it for years.

382
00:24:24.464 --> 00:24:27.176
That was the woman he wanted to marry.

383
00:24:27.259 --> 00:24:30.929
This story is so Charlie Brown.

384
00:24:36.852 --> 00:24:39.730
Charlie Brown wasn't
the only one in the Peanuts Gang

385
00:24:39.813 --> 00:24:41.481
who was unlucky in love.

386
00:24:41.565 --> 00:24:44.193
Peanuts. it's a world of unrequited love.

387
00:24:45.319 --> 00:24:47.863
Lucy pines for Schroeder.

388
00:24:47.946 --> 00:24:52.075
That always cracked me up.
'cause he was always like. "No."

389
00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:53.702
Sally wants Linus.

390
00:24:53.785 --> 00:24:56.788
At one point. Peppermint Patty
actually sort of wants Charlie Brown.

391
00:24:56.872 --> 00:25:00.876
So it's like this unbroken chain
of these children

392
00:25:00.959 --> 00:25:07.174
whose hearts are full of love.
and the love is... almost never returned.

393
00:25:08.175 --> 00:25:10.302
His constant quest for
the little red-haired girl

394
00:25:10.385 --> 00:25:13.514
was just such a-- so relatable to me.

395
00:25:13.597 --> 00:25:15.974
because I always had some monster crush

396
00:25:16.058 --> 00:25:21.188
on some girl in the school
who I never had the nerve to even go near.

397
00:25:21.271 --> 00:25:24.316
And there's a lot of like. "Today's gonna
be the day when I'm gonna get in there

398
00:25:24.399 --> 00:25:26.652
and I'm gonna finally talk to
that little red-haired girl."

399
00:25:26.735 --> 00:25:30.072
"Today's gonna be the day."
And then it never ever comes.

400
00:25:50.342 --> 00:25:52.135
You're so talented. Schroeder.

401
00:25:52.886 --> 00:25:55.889
Do you think your music
is the reason people like you?

402
00:25:57.099 --> 00:26:00.769
That may be true. Charlie Brown.
but it's sort of ironic.

403
00:26:00.853 --> 00:26:05.148
since one of the things I like most
about playing music is the solitude.

404
00:26:10.028 --> 00:26:12.698
It's like your music represents
who you are.

405
00:26:13.574 --> 00:26:16.577
I wonder what music would represent
who I am.

406
00:26:26.044 --> 00:26:30.257
How's your essay coming along.
Charlie Brown? Did my slideshow help?

407
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.972
Hi. Schroeder. Did you miss me?

408
00:26:48.775 --> 00:26:53.488
Over the years. Peanuts
grew and changed just like Sparky did.

409
00:26:53.572 --> 00:26:56.200
And it wasn't always
just about being funny.

410
00:26:56.283 --> 00:27:00.287
My own children grew up.
the strip became really less kid-oriented.

411
00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:02.873
The strip has become more abstract.

412
00:27:02.956 --> 00:27:06.502
and the kids are really just caricatures
of what adults are

413
00:27:06.585 --> 00:27:10.005
and the problems that adults have
and the things that adults really say.

414
00:27:11.215 --> 00:27:14.301
It's a cute little cartoon.
funny characters. funny moments.

415
00:27:14.384 --> 00:27:17.888
But it also is kind of deeper.

416
00:27:17.971 --> 00:27:21.600
The characters are so complex.
and they're talking about human feelings

417
00:27:21.683 --> 00:27:24.686
and emotions. you know.
the human condition.

418
00:27:25.270 --> 00:27:32.236
I think he was one of the best
when it came to capturing the mood.

419
00:27:32.986 --> 00:27:35.864
He captured the mood of the country.

420
00:27:35.948 --> 00:27:39.576
I feel like he always was searching
for the truth and telling the truth.

421
00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:45.207
Sparky wanted the world to be equal for
everyone. and that's what his truth is.

422
00:27:46.959 --> 00:27:51.588
In the late 1960s.
Sparky created Peppermint Patty.

423
00:27:51.672 --> 00:27:54.216
an independent girl
living with a single parent.

424
00:27:54.299 --> 00:27:58.178
who broke her school dress code
by wearing sandals and shorts.

425
00:27:59.054 --> 00:28:01.348
She was so different.

426
00:28:01.431 --> 00:28:03.725
She was not
the stereotypical female character

427
00:28:03.809 --> 00:28:05.352
you would see on the comics page.

428
00:28:05.435 --> 00:28:07.312
She's totally her own person.

429
00:28:07.396 --> 00:28:10.691
She's just. like. so unique.
and she's comfortable being unique

430
00:28:10.774 --> 00:28:12.192
and in her own skin.

431
00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:15.362
Peppermint Patty gets terrible grades.

432
00:28:15.445 --> 00:28:18.240
She's always falling asleep in class.

433
00:28:19.324 --> 00:28:20.659
But she's a great pitcher.

434
00:28:20.742 --> 00:28:24.496
And she beats Chuck's baseball team
every time.

435
00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:27.541
Sometimes by. like. you know. 100-1.

436
00:28:28.125 --> 00:28:30.002
Sports-loving Peppermint Patty

437
00:28:30.085 --> 00:28:33.589
was partially inspired by
Sparky's friend. Billie Jean King.

438
00:28:33.672 --> 00:28:36.884
one of the greatest tennis players
of all time.

439
00:28:37.634 --> 00:28:40.304
You saw the women. the girls in sports.

440
00:28:40.387 --> 00:28:43.348
which of course. as a girl.
I'm like. "That's great."

441
00:28:43.432 --> 00:28:45.017
Sparky was really a feminist.

442
00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:46.935
In the world of Peanuts.

443
00:28:47.019 --> 00:28:50.230
Sparky always made sure
that the girls were just as strong.

444
00:28:50.314 --> 00:28:52.399
and often even stronger than the boys.

445
00:28:52.482 --> 00:28:55.736
The comic strips
really have mirrored our culture.

446
00:28:55.819 --> 00:29:01.200
And it just may be that Peppermint Patty
does represent a new trend among kids

447
00:29:01.283 --> 00:29:03.493
to be more independent and to speak out.

448
00:29:03.577 --> 00:29:07.456
"Here I come. fella! Stop me if you can!"

449
00:29:41.698 --> 00:29:42.741
Yeah!

450
00:29:45.410 --> 00:29:46.411
Yes!

451
00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.211
Good game. Chuck.

452
00:29:54.294 --> 00:29:56.880
But you looked a little distracted
up here.

453
00:29:56.964 --> 00:30:00.133
I'm surprised your team's manager
didn't pull you off the mound.

454
00:30:00.217 --> 00:30:02.302
He is their manager. sir.

455
00:30:02.886 --> 00:30:04.721
Are you okay. Charlie Brown?

456
00:30:04.805 --> 00:30:06.807
It's this homework assignment.

457
00:30:06.890 --> 00:30:09.351
I have to figure out
the meaning of my life.

458
00:30:09.434 --> 00:30:12.229
Boy. Chuck. that is a tall order.

459
00:30:12.312 --> 00:30:15.482
I sure am glad our teacher
didn't give us any homework.

460
00:30:15.566 --> 00:30:18.318
We've had homework
every day this week. sir.

461
00:30:19.695 --> 00:30:22.614
The meaning of life is something
people have always wondered about.

462
00:30:22.698 --> 00:30:23.699
Charlie Brown.

463
00:30:23.782 --> 00:30:26.827
My grandfather always said
that our main purpose in life

464
00:30:26.910 --> 00:30:28.620
is to give and receive love.

465
00:30:30.664 --> 00:30:32.749
He also used to sigh a lot.

466
00:30:34.251 --> 00:30:36.920
I don't know if anyone could ever love me.

467
00:30:37.004 --> 00:30:41.633
I asked Lucy for help. but all she did
was tell me what's wrong with me.

468
00:30:41.717 --> 00:30:43.760
Is there anything right with me?

469
00:30:43.844 --> 00:30:47.598
Absolutely. Chuck.
You've got plenty of good qualities.

470
00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:50.767
I do? Like what. for example?

471
00:30:55.647 --> 00:30:58.066
Well. you're very kind.

472
00:31:00.944 --> 00:31:02.237
And you're generous.

473
00:31:02.321 --> 00:31:05.782
And don't forget helpful.
You're super helpful. Chuck.

474
00:31:05.866 --> 00:31:10.662
Wow. Kind. generous and helpful.
Thanks. guys!

475
00:31:11.163 --> 00:31:13.081
Hey. Lucy. Guess what?

476
00:31:13.165 --> 00:31:17.002
You were wrong.
I'm kind. generous and helpful.

477
00:31:17.085 --> 00:31:19.421
Of course they would say that.
Charlie Brown.

478
00:31:19.505 --> 00:31:22.132
You're kind because your pitches
were so easy to hit.

479
00:31:22.216 --> 00:31:24.593
You were generous to give them
so many runs.

480
00:31:24.676 --> 00:31:26.845
And you helped them win the game.

481
00:31:28.555 --> 00:31:31.266
You sound just like my grandfather.
Charlie Brown.

482
00:31:34.311 --> 00:31:37.689
Franklin Armstrong was
one of the last major characters

483
00:31:37.773 --> 00:31:39.358
to join the Peanuts Gang.

484
00:31:39.441 --> 00:31:42.736
And when he arrived.
he changed the comics forever.

485
00:31:43.445 --> 00:31:48.825
I was in eighth grade when
Franklin made an appearance in Peanuts.

486
00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:52.120
And I remember thinking. "Wow."
Here was a Black character.

487
00:31:52.204 --> 00:31:53.372
Here was a Black kid.

488
00:31:53.455 --> 00:31:56.750
Here I am reading this comic strip.
and all of a sudden there's a kid in there

489
00:31:56.834 --> 00:31:57.835
that looks like me.

490
00:31:58.919 --> 00:32:03.006
It may not seem like
a big deal today. but in 1968.

491
00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:07.636
Black and white kids playing together
in a comic strip was a huge deal.

492
00:32:08.387 --> 00:32:12.140
When he brought Franklin into the strip.
it was 1968.

493
00:32:12.224 --> 00:32:16.019
and the cities were burning
because of Dr. King being assassinated.

494
00:32:16.603 --> 00:32:18.522
Dr. Martin Luther King.

495
00:32:18.605 --> 00:32:21.775
the apostle of nonviolence
in the civil rights movement.

496
00:32:21.859 --> 00:32:24.528
has been shot to death
in Memphis. Tennessee.

497
00:32:24.611 --> 00:32:29.992
And a woman contacted Sparky.
Her name was Harriet Glickman.

498
00:32:30.075 --> 00:32:34.663
She said. "It's time for you.
with this platform you have. Mr. Schulz.

499
00:32:34.746 --> 00:32:36.415
to do something."

500
00:32:36.498 --> 00:32:42.254
She said. "I think you should add
a Black child in Peanuts."

501
00:32:42.337 --> 00:32:46.466
He's like. "I can't. I don't know
what it's like to be a young Black child."

502
00:32:46.550 --> 00:32:50.512
So Harriet Glickman asked her friends
Kenneth Kelly and Monica Gunning.

503
00:32:50.596 --> 00:32:54.600
who were Black. and also parents.
to write to Schulz as well.

504
00:32:55.267 --> 00:32:59.813
Back then. there were
almost no people of color in the comics.

505
00:32:59.897 --> 00:33:03.108
and Sparky realized
what it might mean to all kids

506
00:33:03.192 --> 00:33:05.152
if he could help change that.

507
00:33:05.235 --> 00:33:08.572
He wanted to do something
that had meaning.

508
00:33:08.655 --> 00:33:10.157
that actually said something.

509
00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:13.410
You got the sense from him
he was a very fair-minded person.

510
00:33:13.493 --> 00:33:17.539
And. I mean.
racial inequality is not fairness.

511
00:33:17.623 --> 00:33:19.875
I held off on Franklin for a long time

512
00:33:19.958 --> 00:33:23.045
because I simply felt
I wasn't capable of doing him properly.

513
00:33:23.587 --> 00:33:26.924
And I didn't want to appear
to be patronizing.

514
00:33:27.007 --> 00:33:29.676
I tried to do it without fanfare.

515
00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:34.306
The little incident when he did appear
was two little boys meeting on a beach.

516
00:33:34.389 --> 00:33:37.643
And they discovered
they both liked to make sandcastles.

517
00:33:37.726 --> 00:33:40.270
It doesn't matter
that one is Black and one is white.

518
00:33:40.354 --> 00:33:42.439
"Now. there you are. Charlie Brown.

519
00:33:42.523 --> 00:33:44.858
There's a real sandcastle!"

520
00:33:44.942 --> 00:33:47.611
You know.
papers threatened to drop the strip.

521
00:33:47.694 --> 00:33:50.656
And he was like. "Fine. drop it."
And then they didn't.

522
00:33:50.739 --> 00:33:53.700
And then they were like. "Well.
just don't show them in school together."

523
00:33:53.784 --> 00:33:56.036
And of course.
then it's exactly what he did.

524
00:33:56.119 --> 00:33:58.413
The interesting thing about Franklin was.

525
00:33:58.497 --> 00:34:04.336
you don't remember his personality per se.
as much as he seemed pretty serious.

526
00:34:04.419 --> 00:34:08.422
He was a serious kid
that you almost got the feeling. again.

527
00:34:08.507 --> 00:34:10.634
looking back at it now as an adult.

528
00:34:11.217 --> 00:34:16.306
you know. the burden. almost.
of being this Black kid in a white world.

529
00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:18.266
even though it was a comic strip world.

530
00:34:18.350 --> 00:34:20.143
was weighing on him.

531
00:34:20.226 --> 00:34:23.397
He knew that everybody was
kind of looking at him.

532
00:34:40.121 --> 00:34:44.543
Maybe that's my purpose in life:
feeding a dog.

533
00:34:49.089 --> 00:34:51.425
I guess I can't put it off any longer.

534
00:34:51.507 --> 00:34:52.885
I better start writing.

535
00:35:24.708 --> 00:35:28.420
Who am I? Who am I?

536
00:35:31.507 --> 00:35:33.050
This is hopeless.

537
00:35:33.133 --> 00:35:35.135
Maybe I should get some fresh air.

538
00:35:47.648 --> 00:35:49.691
One of the biggest things to ever happen

539
00:35:49.775 --> 00:35:54.154
to Charlie Brown and his friends was when
they were first brought to life on TV

540
00:35:54.238 --> 00:35:57.074
with A Charlie Brown Christmas.

541
00:35:57.157 --> 00:36:00.035
My mother timed the purchase
of our first color TV

542
00:36:00.118 --> 00:36:03.455
so that I could watch
the Christmas special in color.

543
00:36:03.539 --> 00:36:05.707
That was a huge moment for me.

544
00:36:05.791 --> 00:36:09.211
Every Christmas. we just all
watch it together and drink hot cocoa.

545
00:36:09.294 --> 00:36:11.088
and it's just really fun.

546
00:36:12.005 --> 00:36:15.509
I personally don't celebrate Christmas.
I'm a Jew. I hate Christmas.

547
00:36:15.592 --> 00:36:18.178
It means nothing to me.
Christmas means nothing to me.

548
00:36:18.262 --> 00:36:23.183
But the Charlie Brown Christmas special...
I mean. does it get better than that?

549
00:36:23.267 --> 00:36:25.978
A Charlie Brown Christmas was a huge hit.

550
00:36:26.061 --> 00:36:29.565
and soon there was a Peanuts special
for almost every holiday.

551
00:36:29.648 --> 00:36:32.359
I didn't have traditional holidays
when I was a kid.

552
00:36:32.442 --> 00:36:34.903
Like. I was probably traveling for work.

553
00:36:34.987 --> 00:36:37.072
And so to me.

554
00:36:37.155 --> 00:36:41.660
those specials were like the marker
I didn't have in a traditional home of.

555
00:36:41.743 --> 00:36:44.329
"It's this holiday.
It's this time of year."

556
00:36:44.913 --> 00:36:47.416
I remember the Halloween special ran.

557
00:36:47.499 --> 00:36:48.834
the Great Pumpkin special.

558
00:36:48.917 --> 00:36:51.628
and the ongoing joke. "What did you get?"

559
00:36:51.712 --> 00:36:55.048
"I got an apple." "I got a candy bar."
Charlie Brown...

560
00:36:55.132 --> 00:36:57.134
I got a rock.

561
00:36:58.385 --> 00:37:01.013
All right.
Let's take it from the top again.

562
00:37:06.351 --> 00:37:11.148
Five. four. three. two...
All engines running.

563
00:37:11.648 --> 00:37:14.484
The holiday specials
helped make Peanuts so popular

564
00:37:14.568 --> 00:37:19.573
that NASA named the Apollo 10 modules
after Charlie Brown and Snoopy.

565
00:37:19.656 --> 00:37:22.993
We are very flattered to be part of
your whole program.

566
00:37:23.076 --> 00:37:24.453
and extremely grateful.

567
00:37:24.536 --> 00:37:27.706
I had no idea that all of
these strange things were going to happen.

568
00:37:27.789 --> 00:37:29.833
like Snoopy going to the moon.

569
00:37:29.917 --> 00:37:32.252
Roger. We notice
the resemblance there too.

570
00:37:34.129 --> 00:37:37.466
Certainly one of the most
moving experiences of my entire life.

571
00:37:39.051 --> 00:37:42.429
You have to be such an iconic part
of the culture

572
00:37:42.513 --> 00:37:44.806
for them to name a lunar lander after you.

573
00:37:44.890 --> 00:37:47.559
Do you know what I mean?
Like. can you imagine being that famous?

574
00:37:47.643 --> 00:37:49.686
Like. can you imagine? Like. that's crazy.

575
00:37:50.562 --> 00:37:54.066
But while Charlie Brown
and Snoopy were going to outer space.

576
00:37:54.149 --> 00:37:56.610
Sparky was living a quiet life.

577
00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:58.779
He built a world around himself

578
00:37:58.862 --> 00:38:01.949
that was filled with the things
he had loved since he was a kid.

579
00:38:02.533 --> 00:38:03.951
like a skating rink.

580
00:38:04.743 --> 00:38:06.245
and a baseball field.

581
00:38:07.538 --> 00:38:10.499
He didn't work in a studio.
It was a campus. It was Disneyesque.

582
00:38:10.582 --> 00:38:13.961
This building was a café.
this building had hockey.

583
00:38:15.462 --> 00:38:19.383
I love my daily routine of
getting up and going down to the ice arena

584
00:38:19.466 --> 00:38:22.344
and having breakfast
and going to the studio in the morning.

585
00:38:22.427 --> 00:38:23.804
When it comes right down to it.

586
00:38:23.887 --> 00:38:26.974
I'd rather sit and draw a funny picture
than do anything else.

587
00:38:27.683 --> 00:38:30.769
He'd get up in the morning.
drive down the hill.

588
00:38:30.853 --> 00:38:33.397
would park his car in the same place
across the street.

589
00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.566
He had breakfast at the ice arena.

590
00:38:35.649 --> 00:38:38.026
An English muffin with grape jelly.

591
00:38:38.110 --> 00:38:42.197
And then he went into his office.
sat at his desk and worked.

592
00:38:42.281 --> 00:38:46.785
He would literally go in his office
and wait for the inspiration to hit.

593
00:38:48.245 --> 00:38:50.831
I never saw him not working. really.

594
00:38:50.914 --> 00:38:53.709
Whenever we visited.
he was always in his studio.

595
00:38:53.792 --> 00:38:56.503
That's what he did. He loved it.

596
00:38:56.587 --> 00:39:01.800
That solitary part of his studio
where he would sit and create.

597
00:39:01.884 --> 00:39:06.013
It takes a certain
solitary type of personality

598
00:39:06.096 --> 00:39:11.560
that can handle hours alone in the room.
hours alone in your head.

599
00:39:12.769 --> 00:39:18.400
Even as successful as he was.
I don't know that he got

600
00:39:18.483 --> 00:39:24.573
the full depth of the love and devotion

601
00:39:24.656 --> 00:39:27.451
people had to him and those characters.

602
00:39:36.627 --> 00:39:40.964
Doesn't looking at all these stars
make you feel sort of insignificant.

603
00:39:41.048 --> 00:39:42.257
Charlie Brown?

604
00:39:42.758 --> 00:39:45.093
I always feel insignificant. Linus.

605
00:39:48.263 --> 00:39:50.516
How are you doing with the assignment?

606
00:39:50.599 --> 00:39:52.643
I haven't written a single word.

607
00:39:53.435 --> 00:39:55.604
Maybe I'm just a nobody.

608
00:39:55.687 --> 00:39:58.190
I don't think you're a nobody.
Charlie Brown.

609
00:39:58.273 --> 00:39:59.399
Thanks. Linus.

610
00:40:00.025 --> 00:40:04.613
But what am I supposed to do?
My essay is due tomorrow.

611
00:40:05.113 --> 00:40:07.449
Well. when I'm feeling overwhelmed.

612
00:40:07.533 --> 00:40:10.619
sometimes I find the answers
by staring at the sky.

613
00:40:16.375 --> 00:40:18.043
It's not working. Linus.

614
00:40:18.544 --> 00:40:20.003
What do you see?

615
00:40:20.087 --> 00:40:22.381
A bunch of stars. I guess.

616
00:40:22.464 --> 00:40:25.801
But what does that have to do
with my assignment?

617
00:40:25.884 --> 00:40:29.096
Well. in some ways.
the stars are a lot like you.

618
00:40:31.723 --> 00:40:35.686
If you look closely.
you'll see that every star is different.

619
00:40:35.769 --> 00:40:40.315
They each vary in color. size
and how brightly they shine.

620
00:40:40.399 --> 00:40:43.569
But it's those differences
that create something beautiful.

621
00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.780
Just like us. Charlie Brown.

622
00:40:47.489 --> 00:40:48.782
Each of us is unique.

623
00:40:48.866 --> 00:40:51.827
but we're part of something
much greater than ourselves.

624
00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:53.662
We each have a purpose.

625
00:40:53.745 --> 00:40:56.707
even if it's hard to know for sure
what it is.

626
00:40:56.790 --> 00:41:00.752
And there's joy to be found in the journey
of figuring it out each day.

627
00:41:00.836 --> 00:41:05.132
Maybe for now. your purpose is
just to be Charlie Brown.

628
00:41:08.177 --> 00:41:12.181
Maybe you're right. Linus.
Well. I better get to work.

629
00:41:14.057 --> 00:41:17.769
I guess if there's hope for Charlie Brown.
there's hope for all of us.

630
00:41:23.358 --> 00:41:24.776
By 1980.

631
00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:29.656
Sparky had been drawing Peanuts
practically every day for 30 years.

632
00:41:30.157 --> 00:41:32.784
That's over 10.000 strips.

633
00:41:33.410 --> 00:41:34.494
And in all that time.

634
00:41:34.578 --> 00:41:38.582
he never took a vacation
or missed a single deadline.

635
00:41:38.665 --> 00:41:42.628
You're like a squirrel
running in a cage day in and day out.

636
00:41:42.711 --> 00:41:43.879
No vacations.

637
00:41:43.962 --> 00:41:47.633
A comic strip is
a completely unique form of entertainment.

638
00:41:47.716 --> 00:41:50.969
It lives with you day after day after day.

639
00:41:51.053 --> 00:41:56.266
You gotta be a machine that way
to write the same thing every day

640
00:41:56.350 --> 00:41:58.018
without repeating yourself.

641
00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:01.271
A lot of cartoonists
would pencil the strip

642
00:42:01.355 --> 00:42:03.065
and then have someone else ink it.

643
00:42:04.191 --> 00:42:07.653
But he always insisted on
inking it himself.

644
00:42:07.736 --> 00:42:11.240
He had this matter of pride that
no one ever touched the strip but him.

645
00:42:11.323 --> 00:42:13.116
He did all the work himself.

646
00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:18.539
In July of 1981.
Sparky started having chest pains.

647
00:42:18.622 --> 00:42:21.333
He was rushed to the hospital
for surgery on his heart.

648
00:42:21.416 --> 00:42:22.918
He was in the hospital.

649
00:42:23.001 --> 00:42:26.463
He asked for a sheet of paper
just to see if he could draw a character.

650
00:42:26.547 --> 00:42:31.301
He wanted to do that immediately
to make sure that he could still draw.

651
00:42:31.385 --> 00:42:33.887
And he could. but it had changed.

652
00:42:38.016 --> 00:42:40.853
His hand got shaky.
and his lines got shaky.

653
00:42:41.645 --> 00:42:44.857
And you can see in the later strips.

654
00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.734
the edges of the lines are quite wiggly.

655
00:42:48.235 --> 00:42:51.238
He would say.
"Sometimes my hand shakes so much

656
00:42:51.321 --> 00:42:53.991
that I have to hold it up to draw."

657
00:42:54.074 --> 00:42:58.078
I remember watching him
drawing. say. Charlie Brown.

658
00:42:58.161 --> 00:43:00.038
which is a fairly large circle. the head.

659
00:43:00.122 --> 00:43:02.791
And his hands would shake.
and he'd get so angry.

660
00:43:02.875 --> 00:43:07.713
But yet he said. "I can do rain."
Like. little slashes and lines.

661
00:43:07.796 --> 00:43:09.882
like rain or grass.

662
00:43:11.133 --> 00:43:15.679
He just said. "This is what it looks like
now. This is still authentically my work."

663
00:43:15.762 --> 00:43:20.392
The shaky line becomes his signature move.

664
00:43:21.268 --> 00:43:25.147
Like. that is amazing. That is amazing.
It would've harmed a lot of careers.

665
00:43:25.230 --> 00:43:28.692
But it took Peanuts to another level.

666
00:43:28.775 --> 00:43:35.282
and actually made us feel more empathy
for both him and his characters.

667
00:43:36.283 --> 00:43:40.662
It tells you that he's willing
to put himself out there.

668
00:43:41.246 --> 00:43:43.332
He didn't stop. His ego didn't say.

669
00:43:43.415 --> 00:43:46.001
"If I can't draw perfectly.
I'm not doing that." No.

670
00:43:46.084 --> 00:43:49.129
This was his being.
This is how he communicated.

671
00:43:49.213 --> 00:43:50.506
This is how he lived.

672
00:43:51.882 --> 00:43:54.968
I like to think that I bring up
some solutions now and then.

673
00:43:56.136 --> 00:44:01.642
I suppose one of the solutions is.
as Charlie Brown. just to keep on trying.

674
00:44:04.311 --> 00:44:07.814
He never gives up.
And if anybody should give up. he should.

675
00:44:20.202 --> 00:44:23.914
Good morning. Charlie Brown.
How did your essay writing go?

676
00:44:23.997 --> 00:44:27.084
I was up all night. but I finished it.

677
00:44:27.167 --> 00:44:30.546
-Maybe I'll even get an A.
-That would be nice.

678
00:44:30.629 --> 00:44:33.006
But life's rewards often
manifest themselves

679
00:44:33.090 --> 00:44:35.008
in unconventional ways.

680
00:44:35.092 --> 00:44:38.011
I'm not sure what that means. Linus.

681
00:44:38.095 --> 00:44:41.807
But if I get an A.
that would certainly be unconventional.

682
00:44:55.612 --> 00:44:59.408
Our essays have been graded.
I wonder if I finally got an A.

683
00:45:03.370 --> 00:45:05.372
I can't take the suspense.

684
00:45:07.916 --> 00:45:11.086
C minus? Good grief.

685
00:45:11.837 --> 00:45:13.005
I got an A.

686
00:45:13.088 --> 00:45:16.550
The teacher complimented my penmanship
and perfect margins.

687
00:45:23.223 --> 00:45:27.978
I can't believe it. Linus.
All that work for a C minus.

688
00:45:28.061 --> 00:45:32.232
Cheer up. Charlie Brown.
Grades aren't a measure of one's value.

689
00:45:32.316 --> 00:45:36.486
Anyway. a true work of art
can only be judged over time.

690
00:45:36.987 --> 00:45:40.073
Well. I guess that's something
to look forward to.

691
00:45:44.953 --> 00:45:48.665
"Sometimes I lie awake at night
and I ask. 'Why me?'

692
00:45:49.750 --> 00:45:53.504
Then a voice answers. 'Nothing personal.
your name just happened to come up.'"

693
00:45:59.927 --> 00:46:03.263
Just a few weeks ago. Charles Schulz
announced his retirement from drawing

694
00:46:03.347 --> 00:46:07.059
the Peanuts comic strip in order to
concentrate on treatment for colon cancer.

695
00:46:08.435 --> 00:46:14.274
He was weak from chemo.
and he decided he was going to retire.

696
00:46:14.358 --> 00:46:19.363
I remember very clearly when he said.
"I can't draw the strip anymore."

697
00:46:19.446 --> 00:46:24.284
He came in one day. and we were
talking about doing the last strip.

698
00:46:24.368 --> 00:46:26.745
And he was sitting
a few feet away from me.

699
00:46:26.828 --> 00:46:29.373
and he just looked at me
and he sort of laughed. and he said.

700
00:46:29.456 --> 00:46:31.458
"I really drew some funny things."

701
00:46:31.542 --> 00:46:35.420
And you could just feel how sad he was

702
00:46:35.504 --> 00:46:37.840
that he knew he wasn't gonna be
able to draw it anymore.

703
00:46:38.757 --> 00:46:41.760
The last daily strip
is going to be January 3rd.

704
00:46:41.844 --> 00:46:43.470
the day this story is airing.

705
00:46:43.554 --> 00:46:47.474
Has it completely sunk in that
you're not gonna be doing this anymore?

706
00:46:48.058 --> 00:46:51.687
It didn't really sink in until

707
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:58.068
I was writing a little kind of a
"So long. friends" sort of thing.

708
00:46:58.151 --> 00:47:04.241
And then right at the end.
I wrote his name. my name.

709
00:47:04.324 --> 00:47:06.076
And then it said--

710
00:47:06.159 --> 00:47:07.870
And I'll probably start crying.

711
00:47:09.371 --> 00:47:10.414
It said. well.

712
00:47:12.249 --> 00:47:15.294
that was Charlie Brown.
Linus and so-and-so.

713
00:47:15.377 --> 00:47:16.920
And all of a sudden. I thought...

714
00:47:18.297 --> 00:47:22.467
"You know. that poor. poor kid.
He never even got to kick the football."

715
00:47:26.972 --> 00:47:30.517
Sparky died
on February 12th of the year 2000.

716
00:47:31.018 --> 00:47:32.728
That very same day.

717
00:47:32.811 --> 00:47:35.939
his final Peanuts comic strip
was published.

718
00:47:36.023 --> 00:47:37.441
The day he died

719
00:47:38.609 --> 00:47:41.445
was the day the last strip ran.

720
00:47:41.528 --> 00:47:46.283
I think it says something about
how deeply connected his soul was

721
00:47:46.366 --> 00:47:49.745
to the soul of these amazing characters
that he came up with.

722
00:47:49.828 --> 00:47:52.039
I mean. he was those characters.

723
00:47:52.122 --> 00:47:56.251
It's amazing.
He dies doing the thing he loves.

724
00:47:56.335 --> 00:48:02.382
He was one person telling
this really personal story every day.

725
00:48:02.466 --> 00:48:07.387
And I think the fans.
they got that. They felt that.

726
00:48:07.471 --> 00:48:11.391
These funny. memorable.
wondrous comic strips.

727
00:48:11.475 --> 00:48:14.394
And that you can really just love
and cherish

728
00:48:14.478 --> 00:48:17.397
and take a lot of good life lessons from
as well.

729
00:48:17.481 --> 00:48:21.109
It's about humanity at its most tender.

730
00:48:21.193 --> 00:48:24.112
It's about humanity and its silliness.

731
00:48:24.196 --> 00:48:26.573
It's about humanity without cruelty.

732
00:48:27.366 --> 00:48:30.077
And I think we need that
in our world today.

733
00:48:31.119 --> 00:48:32.746
We may not agree with each other.

734
00:48:32.829 --> 00:48:34.998
We may be a fussbudget like Lucy.

735
00:48:35.082 --> 00:48:38.460
We may be insecure like Charlie Brown.

736
00:48:38.544 --> 00:48:41.964
We may think our philosophy's
the most important. like Linus.

737
00:48:42.047 --> 00:48:44.341
But the reality is.
we're all in it together.

738
00:48:44.424 --> 00:48:47.803
And the conversations
those young children have

739
00:48:47.886 --> 00:48:50.472
resonate with all of us to our soul.

740
00:48:56.770 --> 00:48:59.648
Twenty years after Charles Schulz drew

741
00:48:59.731 --> 00:49:01.149
his last Peanuts strip.

742
00:49:01.233 --> 00:49:03.485
his work and the characters he created

743
00:49:03.569 --> 00:49:06.947
are still being celebrated
around the world.

744
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:09.074
Like Tom Sawyer. Huck Finn.

745
00:49:09.157 --> 00:49:13.662
Peanuts is woven deep into the fabric
of American pop culture.

746
00:49:13.745 --> 00:49:17.040
What resonates still is
the human emotion of it.

747
00:49:17.624 --> 00:49:19.293
That's never gonna change.

748
00:49:19.376 --> 00:49:20.878
It's iconic and it's timeless.

749
00:49:20.961 --> 00:49:25.340
and that everybody around the world
can identify with and love and cherish.

750
00:49:26.049 --> 00:49:28.969
You know.
my grandkids are gonna read Peanuts.

751
00:49:29.052 --> 00:49:30.179
It's Charlie Brown.

752
00:49:30.262 --> 00:49:33.724
Is there anything you'd like
to say to the folks who have read Peanuts

753
00:49:33.807 --> 00:49:35.809
for the last almost 50 years?

754
00:49:35.893 --> 00:49:42.524
It is... amazing that they think
that what I do was good.

755
00:49:43.358 --> 00:49:45.986
I just did the best I could.

756
00:50:11.929 --> 00:50:15.682
Where have you been. Chuck?
Grab your skates.

757
00:50:39.331 --> 00:50:41.124
Nice to see you. Charlie Brown.

758
00:50:43.252 --> 00:50:46.004
Hurry up. Charlie Brown. Grab on.

759
00:50:53.345 --> 00:50:56.723
There's nothing quite like
the first snowfall of the year.
