3
00:00:26.317 --> 00:00:27.485
Thank you!

4
00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:31.531
Thank you very much.

5
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:34.951
Thank you for being here.

6
00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.579
It is nice to be out of the house. huh?

7
00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:39.289
Yes!

8
00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:44.252
I don't really--
I don't wanna talk about COVID tonight.

9
00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:45.712
A couple of things

10
00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:47.005
I will mention.

11
00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:50.258
I learned a couple of things during COVID.

12
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:52.093
One. I learned.

13
00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:55.472
from wearing that mask everywhere I went

14
00:00:56.514 --> 00:00:58.224
and breathing my own breath.

15
00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:02.145
I need to go back
and apologize to anybody I've talked to

16
00:01:02.228 --> 00:01:04.606
in the last 30 years.

17
00:01:06.816 --> 00:01:08.401
Oh my!

18
00:01:11.112 --> 00:01:15.658
I had no idea my breath was that bad.

19
00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:19.120
Seriously. one day
I was in the grocery store

20
00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:23.708
and I'm like.
"Has a cow pooped in a gut pile?"

21
00:01:23.792 --> 00:01:25.335
"What is that?"

22
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:28.713
And you're like. "Oh no. that's me."

23
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.135
Something else I learned during COVID.
especially during lockdown.

24
00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:36.513
is I am not qualified

25
00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:40.266
to meet all of my wife's
conversational needs.

26
00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:44.562
It takes a village. as they say.

27
00:01:45.146 --> 00:01:47.065
And I am but one man.

28
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.027
I love my sweet little wife to death.

29
00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:54.948
but she is a talker. She could talk
three dogs off a meat wagon.

30
00:01:56.407 --> 00:01:59.619
And she's also what they call
a verbal processor.

31
00:01:59.702 --> 00:02:03.748
which means every time
she has a thought or an idea.

32
00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:07.168
she doesn't just think it.
she says it out loud.

33
00:02:07.252 --> 00:02:10.255
So every morning during lockdown.

34
00:02:10.338 --> 00:02:13.758
I would get up
and pour myself a cup of coffee.

35
00:02:13.842 --> 00:02:16.386
and I'd turn around.
and there she would be.

36
00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:17.804
Every morning it'd be like.

37
00:02:17.887 --> 00:02:20.723
"Have you thought of where
we'll go when the pandemic is over?"

38
00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:23.768
"I gotta get out of this house.
Talking about out of this house.

39
00:02:23.852 --> 00:02:27.605
you won't believe what I found out about
the family that moved in down the street."

40
00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:30.150
"I told you
I thought that lady looked weird."

41
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.403
"There's a light out in the kitchen.
I can't cook in the dark."

42
00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:36.239
"So if you wanna eat.
you might wanna pull the ladder out."

43
00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:39.576
"Why is it so hot in here?
Are you not hot? I am burning up."

44
00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.496
"Robin told me she can't find toilet paper
anywhere. people are hoarding it."

45
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.208
"There ought to be an express line
in hell for whoever hoards toilet paper."

46
00:02:47.292 --> 00:02:48.501
"That is so wrong."

47
00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:53.506
"My God. I just saw my butt in the mirror.
Why didn't you say something to me?"

48
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.425
"It's getting as wide as a school bus."

49
00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:58.094
"It's a wonder
I'm not knocking lamps off the table."

50
00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:00.722
"I had the weirdest dream last night."

51
00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:04.350
"I dreamed that your mother
and Will Smith got married.

52
00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:06.394
and that's not even the weird part."

53
00:03:06.477 --> 00:03:09.772
"The weird thing is.
they were jumping on the trampoline

54
00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.150
with firemen helmets on
and saying their vows."

55
00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:14.194
"What do you think that is all about?"

56
00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:17.071
"Why are you looking at me like that?
Is my hair messed up?"

57
00:03:17.655 --> 00:03:20.241
"Concentrate. I want you
to help me think of somebody

58
00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.202
we can set my cousin Kyle up with."

59
00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.954
"Bless his heart. he's all by himself
and he needs somebody.

60
00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:25.997
Talking about needs.

61
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.709
I need you to look at my car because
the engine light's been on for a while."

62
00:03:29.792 --> 00:03:32.086
"When I say a while. I mean a few months."

63
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.338
"Every time I drive it.

64
00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:36.591
there's a burning smell.
I don't think it's supposed to do that."

65
00:03:37.258 --> 00:03:41.054
"My God. what if Kyle is gay
and he hasn't come out of the closet yet?"

66
00:03:41.137 --> 00:03:43.681
"Say a little prayer
for Chip and Jennifer's grandson."

67
00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:47.268
"He's getting circumcised today.
And speaking of 30% off.

68
00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:49.646
that necklace I've been wanting
is on sale."

69
00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:53.316
"If you wanna get it for me
for my birthday. that would be all right."

70
00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.654
"Hey. if Kyle is gay. do you know
somebody we could set him up with?"

71
00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:58.821
"You work in show business.

72
00:03:58.905 --> 00:04:01.783
and there are
a lot of gay people in show business."

73
00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:04.786
"You'll roll your eyes
and tell me it's too far down the road.

74
00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:07.205
but for next year's Fourth of July picnic.

75
00:04:07.288 --> 00:04:09.874
should I make potato salad
like I did this year.

76
00:04:09.958 --> 00:04:13.711
or should I make that baked macaroni stuff
with the feta cheese and the tomatoes

77
00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:16.506
I made a few weeks ago and you loved it?
I could do either."

78
00:04:16.589 --> 00:04:17.799
"It doesn't matter to me."

79
00:04:17.882 --> 00:04:20.093
"And what's the deal
with your brother lately?"

80
00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:23.888
"He's become such a Moody Judy.
I don't even wanna talk to him."

81
00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:26.224
"Why are you making a noose?"

82
00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:31.187
"Untie that from the ceiling fan
and get off the bed."

83
00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:33.356
"You're messing up all my pillows."

84
00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.570
My day every day during lockdown.

85
00:04:47.787 --> 00:04:50.915
Now. some good stuff
happened during COVID too.

86
00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:55.336
Some really good stuff. I became a grandpa
for the very first time during COVID.

87
00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:56.838
So…

88
00:04:58.006 --> 00:05:01.968
And I love this little boy
more than any human being on the planet.

89
00:05:02.051 --> 00:05:06.180
And my daughter. I don't know how
she pulled this off. but somehow.

90
00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:09.600
she arranged to be able
to get on the <i>Jerry Springer Show.</i>

91
00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:12.061
and we were able
to find out who the father is

92
00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:15.148
without spending one dime
of our own money. so.

93
00:05:15.648 --> 00:05:17.025
that was great.

94
00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.528
I'm kidding.

95
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.740
We have no idea who the father is.

96
00:05:27.076 --> 00:05:32.165
Something else great that happened
is my mother's flip phone finally broke.

97
00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.044
That is an event 20 years in the making.

98
00:05:36.794 --> 00:05:39.756
One month into COVID.
my mom's flip phone broke.

99
00:05:39.839 --> 00:05:42.550
so we bought her her very first iPhone.

100
00:05:42.633 --> 00:05:45.678
And if you were
to say to me tonight. "Jeff.

101
00:05:45.762 --> 00:05:49.724
would rather teach your mother how to text

102
00:05:49.807 --> 00:05:52.685
or teach your dog how to wipe his ass?"

103
00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.521
I'd probably say.

104
00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:57.148
"Hand me the toilet paper."

105
00:05:57.231 --> 00:05:59.025
"Let me give that a shot."

106
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.073
The texting has been
a little bit of a challenge.

107
00:06:05.156 --> 00:06:07.283
And my daughters were so excited

108
00:06:07.367 --> 00:06:09.952
that their Gaba was finally texting.

109
00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:11.245
So they're texting her.

110
00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:13.706
One night. I get a call from my mom.

111
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.792
and she says to me.

112
00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.460
"What is 'LOL'?"

113
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:23.216
I said. "What are you talking about. Mom?"
She said. "Jordan sent me a text

114
00:06:23.299 --> 00:06:25.802
and at the end of it said 'LOL.'"

115
00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:30.139
I said. "How do you spell it?"
She said. "L-O-L."

116
00:06:31.099 --> 00:06:34.018
I said. "Mom. that's not 'LOL.'
That's 'Laugh Out Loud.'"

117
00:06:34.102 --> 00:06:38.356
"That's what the kids do now.
Instead of writing everything out.

118
00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:39.941
they just use initials."

119
00:06:40.024 --> 00:06:41.984
"Like IDK is 'I don't know.'"

120
00:06:42.068 --> 00:06:43.694
"OMG is 'Oh my gosh.'"

121
00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.655
I said. "That's how they do it."

122
00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:47.407
A few nights later.

123
00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.993
I get a text from my mother that says.

124
00:06:51.077 --> 00:06:56.999
"I. Y. G. T. T. G. S. I. N. S. K."

125
00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:04.882
I'm like. "Oh God. Mom's had a stroke."

126
00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:10.638
I called her up and said.
"Mom. what did you just text me?"

127
00:07:10.721 --> 00:07:13.724
She said. "I was doing like the girls do."

128
00:07:13.808 --> 00:07:18.354
"I said. 'If you go to the grocery store.
I need some ketchup.'"

129
00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.734
"Well. of course. Why didn't see that?"

130
00:07:27.321 --> 00:07:29.449
And she loves this iPhone

131
00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.410
because it has features on it
that her flip phone didn't have.

132
00:07:32.493 --> 00:07:34.203
Like reception.

133
00:07:36.372 --> 00:07:38.332
So she called me one night.

134
00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.334
and I answered

135
00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:43.212
'cause I didn't have
anything to do for an hour and half.

136
00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:47.884
And I'm talking to my mom.
and during the call. my mom mentioned

137
00:07:47.967 --> 00:07:51.345
that there'd been
a couple of break-ins in her neighborhood.

138
00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:55.183
I said. "Mom. that's a little concerning."
She said. "I know."

139
00:07:55.266 --> 00:07:59.729
She said. "That is why I'm thinking
about getting my carry permit."

140
00:08:01.481 --> 00:08:04.859
My mother is 85 years old.

141
00:08:05.401 --> 00:08:07.945
Her eyesight is bad. her hearing is worse.

142
00:08:08.029 --> 00:08:12.450
and she has the balance
of Ron White after midnight.

143
00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:22.376
And now.
she's thinking about getting a pistol.

144
00:08:23.503 --> 00:08:26.756
I said. "Look. Mom. I am a supporter
of the Second Amendment."

145
00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:29.383
"You can call me overly cautious." I said.

146
00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.260
"But maybe

147
00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.346
you shouldn't be packing heat

148
00:08:33.429 --> 00:08:36.015
if you're wearing a Life Alert."

149
00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:42.188
Though she could use her pillboxes
to sort the bullets in. you know.

150
00:08:43.439 --> 00:08:46.609
I said. "Mom.
you might want to think this out."

151
00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:48.653
"You better hope loading the thing

152
00:08:48.736 --> 00:08:52.198
is easier than opening a jar of pickles.
or you're gonna be in trouble."

153
00:08:52.698 --> 00:08:55.243
'Cause she has arthritis in her fingers.

154
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:00.081
Then I thought. "Hell. I bet my agent
could get her a commercial.'

155
00:09:00.831 --> 00:09:04.585
"You know. my arthritis had gotten so bad

156
00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:08.589
that I could barely
jack a round into the chamber."

157
00:09:09.507 --> 00:09:13.970
"But thanks to new. improved Bufferin.
I can make it rain. dawg."

158
00:09:16.013 --> 00:09:17.723
"You feel me. bruh?"

159
00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:24.981
I hung up and said to my wife.

160
00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:27.024
"I know what
I'm getting Mom for Christmas."

161
00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:31.696
"I'm getting her the magnetic holster
she can slap on the side of her walker.

162
00:09:31.779 --> 00:09:34.699
and I'm getting her husband
the bulletproof vest

163
00:09:34.782 --> 00:09:37.618
he can wear underneath
his cardigan sweater.

164
00:09:37.702 --> 00:09:41.539
just in case she goes spider monkey
during the <i>Wheel of Fortune."</i>

165
00:09:48.838 --> 00:09:52.592
And that's where
my wife and I are in life right now.

166
00:09:52.675 --> 00:09:56.137
We got our kids grown.
got them out of the house.

167
00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:59.473
We had a quick snack.
Now. we're raising our parents.

168
00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:02.977
I swear they passed each other
in the driveway.

169
00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:06.897
Let me tell you something.
I thought teenagers were crazy.

170
00:10:06.981 --> 00:10:10.776
Teenagers are a piece of cake
compared to old people.

171
00:10:12.278 --> 00:10:13.738
They're nuts!

172
00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:18.576
I was getting my car serviced a while back
and they called to say it was ready.

173
00:10:18.659 --> 00:10:21.829
I called my father-in-law. '"Can you
give me a ride to the dealership?"

174
00:10:21.912 --> 00:10:25.333
On the way to the dealership.
he needed to stop for gas.

175
00:10:25.416 --> 00:10:27.877
I learned on that little stop

176
00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:29.712
that it is possible

177
00:10:30.212 --> 00:10:32.548
to wash your entire car

178
00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:36.302
with the squeegee from the gas station.

179
00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:41.140
And I know this
because I sat in the passenger seat

180
00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:43.476
and watched him do it.

181
00:10:44.393 --> 00:10:48.522
I sat there until the guy
at the next pump started videoing it.

182
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.901
then I slid down on the floorboard

183
00:10:52.401 --> 00:10:55.404
'cause I didn't want
to get tagged on Instagram.

184
00:10:56.405 --> 00:10:57.948
He got back in the car. I said.

185
00:10:58.032 --> 00:11:01.827
"You do realize the gas station
has got a car wash right there?"

186
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:05.498
He goes. "Yeah. well. that's six bucks."

187
00:11:06.457 --> 00:11:09.085
I'm like. "So to save six dollars.

188
00:11:09.168 --> 00:11:13.089
you gave away all your dignity
and washed your car

189
00:11:13.172 --> 00:11:18.219
with a squeegee and
the dirtiest water on the planet Earth?"

190
00:11:18.803 --> 00:11:21.847
I used to have fantasies
about going out with a girl

191
00:11:21.931 --> 00:11:26.018
as nasty as the squeegee water
at the gas station.

192
00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:30.523
He is such a trip.

193
00:11:30.606 --> 00:11:34.443
And he walks around.
he's got his pants up to his nipples now.

194
00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:39.073
And he just talks about how the world
has gone to hell in a hay wagon.

195
00:11:39.156 --> 00:11:43.119
and it used to be so much better
back in the good old days.

196
00:11:43.202 --> 00:11:46.330
Of course. when he describes
the way he grew up.

197
00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:48.999
it's always tough. It's like. "Oh yeah."

198
00:11:49.083 --> 00:11:52.336
"We had no electricity.
me and my brother shared a pair of shoes."

199
00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.548
"We had to walk to school
through five feet of snow."

200
00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:59.969
I'm like. "When did it snow
five feet in New Orleans?"

201
00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:06.308
But I kinda get what he means
about the good old days.

202
00:12:06.392 --> 00:12:09.687
Because. think about it. as you get old.

203
00:12:10.479 --> 00:12:13.899
technology has changed your entire life.

204
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:15.693
Morality has changed.

205
00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:17.403
Society has changed.

206
00:12:17.486 --> 00:12:18.320
All of a sudden.

207
00:12:18.404 --> 00:12:21.699
you find yourself living in a world
that doesn't make sense to you.

208
00:12:21.782 --> 00:12:25.786
So you kinda long for that world where
you felt like you had things figured out.

209
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:28.748
To them. that's the good old days.
but it couldn't have been perfect.

210
00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:30.708
I was asking my mom about it.

211
00:12:31.208 --> 00:12:35.755
Do you know my mom had an outhouse
until she was 14 years old?

212
00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:38.966
I said. "Mom.
what would you do in the wintertime

213
00:12:39.049 --> 00:12:42.219
if you had to go to the bathroom
and it was late at night?"

214
00:12:42.303 --> 00:12:44.388
She said. "We went in a bucket."

215
00:12:45.181 --> 00:12:48.559
They called it a slop jar
or honey pot. That's what they did.

216
00:12:48.642 --> 00:12:51.061
They went to the bathroom in a bucket.

217
00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:52.855
And I'm thinking.

218
00:12:52.938 --> 00:12:57.985
"I know how my wife responds
to the aroma of a broccoli casserole

219
00:12:58.068 --> 00:13:01.822
that's been in the refrigerator
one day too long."

220
00:13:02.448 --> 00:13:05.201
"I cannot imagine her response

221
00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:07.912
to a bucket of turds in the living room."

222
00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:15.294
And you know
one of the euphemisms for dying

223
00:13:15.377 --> 00:13:17.379
is "He kicked the bucket."

224
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:22.092
I bet you
that's what that's talking about.

225
00:13:23.302 --> 00:13:24.428
"Baby. I'm sorry.

226
00:13:24.512 --> 00:13:28.224
but I accidentally kicked over
that bucket there in the living room."

227
00:13:35.397 --> 00:13:37.900
I think if things had been perfect
in the good old days.

228
00:13:37.983 --> 00:13:41.654
the guy that invented Viagra
wouldn't be a billionaire.

229
00:13:42.238 --> 00:13:43.614
'Cause back in the good old days.

230
00:13:43.697 --> 00:13:46.242
when God told you
you were out of the game.

231
00:13:46.325 --> 00:13:49.829
you just walked out in the backyard
and started a garden.

232
00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:52.873
And the only hoe you were playing with

233
00:13:52.957 --> 00:13:55.501
was the one to get the weeds
out of the tomatoes.

234
00:13:56.877 --> 00:14:00.840
But now. thanks to Viagra.
people are playing into their eighties.

235
00:14:01.715 --> 00:14:05.052
Let that mental image
sink in just a second.

236
00:14:05.135 --> 00:14:08.347
Just that pile of flesh.
and everything in the pile

237
00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:11.058
looks like it needs ironing. you know.

238
00:14:14.979 --> 00:14:16.981
I do think it's cool
that the nursing homes

239
00:14:17.064 --> 00:14:19.316
are now giving the old guys
half a tablet a night.

240
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.112
just to keep them
from falling out of bed. so…

241
00:14:25.698 --> 00:14:28.075
Kind of a kickstand deal there.

242
00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:33.914
Now. everybody talks about this stuff.

243
00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:36.166
Back in the good old days.

244
00:14:36.250 --> 00:14:37.835
if a man was

245
00:14:37.918 --> 00:14:40.254
trying to shoot pool with a rope.

246
00:14:41.422 --> 00:14:43.507
he kept it to himself.

247
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.677
But now. it's a cottage industry.

248
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.139
I heard a radio ad the other day
where this guy said.

249
00:14:50.222 --> 00:14:53.183
thanks to his ED formulas.

250
00:14:53.267 --> 00:14:55.519
he could now help men perform

251
00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:59.231
for 30. 60. even 90 minutes.

252
00:14:59.315 --> 00:15:02.484
I'm thinking. "90 minutes?"

253
00:15:07.364 --> 00:15:10.743
Oh my gosh.
my attention span is not that long.

254
00:15:11.535 --> 00:15:15.831
After 20. I'd be like. "I'm gonna go
make a sandwich. You want anything?"

255
00:15:20.586 --> 00:15:24.506
I mean. there is a little something
to aging gracefully. right?

256
00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:26.675
And I miss my youth.

257
00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.510
I miss my young body.

258
00:15:28.594 --> 00:15:31.889
I would not trade
my old-minded soul for it.

259
00:15:31.972 --> 00:15:34.183
but I do miss my young body.

260
00:15:34.266 --> 00:15:38.562
I remember being a little kid
and having energy to burn.

261
00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:43.776
When was the last time you had
excess energy you needed to burn off?

262
00:15:44.401 --> 00:15:47.655
Think about it. When you were a kid.
you had so much energy

263
00:15:47.738 --> 00:15:51.075
you couldn't watch TV
just sitting in a chair.

264
00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:55.287
You had to stand on your head.
or be half on the chair and half off.

265
00:15:55.371 --> 00:15:56.705
The commercial would come on.

266
00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:59.583
and you'd wrestle with each other
till the show came back.

267
00:15:59.667 --> 00:16:02.127
Hell. if you walked in my house now

268
00:16:02.211 --> 00:16:04.129
and you found me watching the TV

269
00:16:04.213 --> 00:16:07.633
with my butt on the sofa
and my head on the floor.

270
00:16:07.716 --> 00:16:10.594
call 911.

271
00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.764
Because even if I am still alive.

272
00:16:13.847 --> 00:16:18.769
there's no way I'm gonna be able to
get back to a standing position by myself.

273
00:16:27.111 --> 00:16:28.862
But I had a great childhood.

274
00:16:28.946 --> 00:16:31.657
You know. I played every sport.

275
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:32.825
for the recreation center.

276
00:16:32.908 --> 00:16:35.369
My parents didn't make me pick one sport

277
00:16:35.452 --> 00:16:38.998
because they thought
I was gonna play professional whatever.

278
00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:41.542
I played every sport.
And it was weird back then.

279
00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:43.293
Because if you wanted a trophy.

280
00:16:43.377 --> 00:16:46.046
you had to finish in first place.

281
00:16:47.172 --> 00:16:48.674
It was nuts.

282
00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:57.516
So many great memories.

283
00:16:57.599 --> 00:16:59.977
I remember. as a child.
going to the doctor.

284
00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:03.063
If you behaved yourself
and you didn't cry if you got a shot.

285
00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:06.400
you always got to pick out
a toy from the treasure chest

286
00:17:06.483 --> 00:17:09.862
behind the nurse's station.
Anybody remember the treasure chest?

287
00:17:09.945 --> 00:17:12.197
Why did that have to stop?

288
00:17:12.865 --> 00:17:15.159
Seriously. I wouldn't mind
going to the doctor now

289
00:17:15.242 --> 00:17:17.745
and him putting on a rubber glove
to check my prostate

290
00:17:17.828 --> 00:17:20.664
if I knew on the way out
I could swing by the treasure chest

291
00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:23.250
and get a new spider ring. you know.

292
00:17:24.543 --> 00:17:25.919
"That baby glows in the dark."

293
00:17:26.003 --> 00:17:29.089
"Turn out the lights.
Check that out right there."

294
00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:35.971
I remember being a kid.
laying in the back window of the car

295
00:17:36.055 --> 00:17:38.057
riding all the way to Florida.

296
00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:41.143
Nowadays. because of child car-seat laws.

297
00:17:41.226 --> 00:17:44.354
you have to be in the 6th grade
before you can see where you're going

298
00:17:44.438 --> 00:17:46.899
instead of where you just been.

299
00:17:50.778 --> 00:17:52.946
Now one of the hardest things
in our lives

300
00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.365
is we have to remember passwords.

301
00:17:55.449 --> 00:17:59.286
Nobody can remember their password
to any… There's so many of them.

302
00:17:59.369 --> 00:18:01.538
When I was growing up
in the good old days.

303
00:18:01.622 --> 00:18:03.749
I only had to remember one password.

304
00:18:03.832 --> 00:18:08.128
That was the password to get in
to our secret clubhouse back in the woods.

305
00:18:08.629 --> 00:18:10.005
And it was a beauty.

306
00:18:12.549 --> 00:18:13.884
"What's the password?"

307
00:18:17.262 --> 00:18:18.222
"Boobies."

308
00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.357
It was all we thought about.
so why not make it the password?

309
00:18:28.982 --> 00:18:32.027
Every meeting I ever remember
having in the clubhouse.

310
00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:33.737
that's what it was about.

311
00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:35.989
One of my friends.

312
00:18:36.073 --> 00:18:37.825
I think he's in prison now.

313
00:18:37.908 --> 00:18:41.286
had a theory that
if heaven was a perfect place.

314
00:18:41.370 --> 00:18:43.080
once you get past the pearly gates.

315
00:18:43.163 --> 00:18:45.582
it would just be
a giant field of naked boobies.

316
00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:49.711
and they'd let you take your shoes off
and run around for a little while.

317
00:19:05.352 --> 00:19:09.148
I remember thinking right then and there.
"I'm going to church."

318
00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:17.239
I know education is probably better now.

319
00:19:17.322 --> 00:19:20.576
I mean. they test you to see
if you have learning differences.

320
00:19:20.659 --> 00:19:23.328
or if you're gifted.
they might give you elevated courses.

321
00:19:23.412 --> 00:19:26.623
Back in the good old days.
it didn't matter if you were a genius

322
00:19:26.707 --> 00:19:30.627
or if you were eating crayons.
you were all in the same class.

323
00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:34.298
And they put no thought
into what they were teaching us.

324
00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:36.842
I remember
my 11th-grade year of high school.

325
00:19:36.925 --> 00:19:40.762
one semester of English
was devoted entirely to poetry.

326
00:19:41.513 --> 00:19:44.850
What were blue-collar kids
from the wrong side of the tracks

327
00:19:44.933 --> 00:19:46.935
going to do with poetry?

328
00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:51.481
<i>My husband won't fix</i>
<i>The broken screen door</i>

329
00:19:51.982 --> 00:19:55.569
<i>Our cat just threw up</i>
<i>A dead bird on the floor</i>

330
00:19:56.069 --> 00:19:59.740
<i>I have four little children</i>
<i>I constantly feed</i>

331
00:19:59.823 --> 00:20:03.744
<i>So please don't you ask me</i>
<i>Why I smoke weed</i>

332
00:20:14.338 --> 00:20:18.383
Now they're teaching sex education
in 5th grade. starting in the 5th grade.

333
00:20:18.467 --> 00:20:21.887
Nobody taught me about sex
back in the good old days.

334
00:20:21.970 --> 00:20:25.224
My parents told me nothing.
My school taught me nothing.

335
00:20:25.307 --> 00:20:29.061
Everything I learned about sex
I pieced together for myself.

336
00:20:29.561 --> 00:20:33.649
I'm serious. When I was 11.
we had an uncle that raised rabbits.

337
00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:36.360
So we were out at his farm one weekend.

338
00:20:36.443 --> 00:20:39.696
and he took a group of us
out to the shed where he kept the rabbits.

339
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:44.368
He had all the males in cages on one side.
and all the females in cages on the other.

340
00:20:44.451 --> 00:20:45.786
He opened a male's cage.

341
00:20:45.869 --> 00:20:48.997
grabbed him by the neck.
walked over. opened a female's cage.

342
00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:50.040
dropped him in there.

343
00:20:50.123 --> 00:20:54.878
And that male rabbit
jumped on top of that female rabbit

344
00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:58.632
and jackhammered like a hurricane

345
00:20:58.715 --> 00:21:01.218
for. like. five seconds.

346
00:21:01.301 --> 00:21:03.428
Then he fell off on his back.

347
00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:07.557
And everybody was laughing. except me.

348
00:21:08.183 --> 00:21:12.980
'Cause I'm like. "Oh my God. I don't know
if I gonna be able to do it that fast."

349
00:21:15.774 --> 00:21:19.278
Turns out I had nothing to worry about.

350
00:21:28.203 --> 00:21:29.830
You know. probably the…

351
00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:32.958
the thing that changed most

352
00:21:33.041 --> 00:21:35.210
from the good old days to now

353
00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:36.670
is this.

354
00:21:36.753 --> 00:21:38.588
This little gadget right there.

355
00:21:39.089 --> 00:21:41.466
This little gadget changed the world.

356
00:21:41.550 --> 00:21:46.221
Now everybody on the planet
has one of these in their hand. 24/7. 365.

357
00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:48.932
Doesn't matter
if you're in a third world country.

358
00:21:49.016 --> 00:21:51.268
you might not have enough to eat.
you got a phone.

359
00:21:51.351 --> 00:21:55.939
See. back in the good old days.
my entire family had one phone.

360
00:21:56.023 --> 00:21:59.026
It was hardwired
into the wall of the kitchen.

361
00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:01.194
It came in four possible colors:

362
00:22:01.278 --> 00:22:05.824
Black. white.
harvest gold. and avocado green.

363
00:22:08.368 --> 00:22:10.329
We had the avocado green.

364
00:22:10.412 --> 00:22:14.082
and my parents actually
sprung for the extra-long cord.

365
00:22:14.583 --> 00:22:18.712
Let me tell you. the phone company
didn't cheat you on the extra-long cord.

366
00:22:18.795 --> 00:22:22.758
Our phone cord
was over a quarter of a mile long.

367
00:22:23.467 --> 00:22:26.428
My mom could walk down the driveway
and check the mail.

368
00:22:26.511 --> 00:22:29.514
never quit talking to her sister.
"You know. 'cause I…"

369
00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:33.643
But because
the whole family had one phone.

370
00:22:33.727 --> 00:22:36.688
you never had any privacy
if it was for you.

371
00:22:36.772 --> 00:22:39.608
So you'd learn tricks.
Like. you'd run it under the door

372
00:22:39.691 --> 00:22:44.029
and go down the hall or sit in the pantry
and talk to your boyfriend or girlfriend

373
00:22:44.112 --> 00:22:48.116
while your siblings made
kissing noises from around the corner.

374
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.577
But because you stretched it out so far.

375
00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.080
remember the downside
of the extra-long cord?

376
00:22:53.163 --> 00:22:54.331
Anybody remember?

377
00:22:54.873 --> 00:22:56.625
Yeah. it was always

378
00:22:57.125 --> 00:22:58.418
tangled up.

379
00:22:58.919 --> 00:23:02.381
Like Aunt Judy's thong
after kickboxing lessons.

380
00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:09.471
But when it was stretched out.
it was almost like a lethal weapon.

381
00:23:10.055 --> 00:23:12.224
My mom used to talk
on the phone while cooking.

382
00:23:12.307 --> 00:23:14.142
they were on other sides of the kitchen.

383
00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:16.561
So one night she's cooking
and talking on the phone.

384
00:23:16.645 --> 00:23:19.231
and I'm chasing my brother
through the house.

385
00:23:19.314 --> 00:23:20.816
We round into the kitchen.

386
00:23:20.899 --> 00:23:23.985
he never saw the phone cord.
He hit it right there.

387
00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:25.362
His feet went up in the air.

388
00:23:25.445 --> 00:23:28.990
the back of his head hit the floor
like wedding night panties.

389
00:23:30.367 --> 00:23:33.703
My mom never quit cooking
and never quit talking. She…

390
00:23:34.788 --> 00:23:36.123
I'm on the phone.

391
00:23:49.428 --> 00:23:51.263
Now. I will say this.

392
00:23:51.346 --> 00:23:54.808
Back in the good old days.
you got excited when the phone rang.

393
00:23:54.891 --> 00:23:57.727
You would race each other
to answer the phone.

394
00:23:57.811 --> 00:23:59.771
'Cause you had no idea who it might be.

395
00:23:59.855 --> 00:24:02.566
Might be your grandmother
or the President of the US.

396
00:24:02.649 --> 00:24:04.443
You didn't know until you picked it up.

397
00:24:04.526 --> 00:24:10.282
But now caller ID has taken
all the joy out of answering the phone.

398
00:24:10.365 --> 00:24:11.992
Now your phone rings. you're like.

399
00:24:12.951 --> 00:24:15.245
"Hell no. I ain't doing that."

400
00:24:16.663 --> 00:24:18.790
"Nobody got time for that."

401
00:24:20.375 --> 00:24:24.129
And because we stick our phones
in our pockets. purses. and things.

402
00:24:24.212 --> 00:24:26.047
they're always rubbing against something.

403
00:24:26.131 --> 00:24:29.801
and we're always accidentally
dialing people we didn't mean to dial.

404
00:24:29.885 --> 00:24:31.470
We call them "butt-dials."

405
00:24:32.137 --> 00:24:34.890
All right. I'm gonna see
what an honest audience you are.

406
00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:38.351
How many people
listen more intently to butt-dials

407
00:24:38.435 --> 00:24:40.562
than they do actual phone calls?

408
00:24:45.233 --> 00:24:47.736
If somebody butt-dials me
and I have nothing to do.

409
00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:50.238
I'll stay on for. like. 20 minutes.

410
00:24:55.118 --> 00:24:57.329
I have a buddy named Purdie.
makes furniture.

411
00:24:57.412 --> 00:25:00.248
Purd always sticks his phone
in the front pocket of his jeans.

412
00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:02.042
so he's always butt-dialing somebody.

413
00:25:02.125 --> 00:25:05.795
One night he butt-dialed me.
and I didn't have anything going on.

414
00:25:05.879 --> 00:25:09.007
so I'm just listening to him
walk around his shop.

415
00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:10.592
After about ten minutes.

416
00:25:10.675 --> 00:25:13.386
I hear a door open.
and I hear a lid go up.

417
00:25:14.054 --> 00:25:16.223
and I hear him starting to pee.

418
00:25:17.057 --> 00:25:20.268
Being the mature adult that I am.
I jumped out of my chair.

419
00:25:20.352 --> 00:25:21.978
ran into the kitchen to my wife.

420
00:25:22.062 --> 00:25:24.481
and went. "Purd's peeing!"

421
00:25:25.190 --> 00:25:28.902
We put it on speaker phone.
and me and my wife stood there

422
00:25:29.486 --> 00:25:32.280
and listened to my friend urinate.

423
00:25:33.365 --> 00:25:36.076
"Oh my God. I hope he farts at the end."

424
00:25:36.159 --> 00:25:37.619
"Please."

425
00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:43.041
What is wrong with us?

426
00:25:45.085 --> 00:25:47.754
And here's the fascination with this.

427
00:25:47.837 --> 00:25:50.757
The thing we had
mounted on the wall in the kitchen.

428
00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:52.092
that was only a phone.

429
00:25:52.175 --> 00:25:53.552
This is everything.

430
00:25:53.635 --> 00:25:57.764
This is everything
we used to go somewhere else to get.

431
00:25:57.847 --> 00:26:00.934
Like. people used to stay up late
to watch the 11:00 news.

432
00:26:01.017 --> 00:26:04.521
so they knew what the sports scores were
and what the weather was gonna be.

433
00:26:04.604 --> 00:26:06.856
Now you have up-to-the-minute radar.

434
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.692
You've got the weather for two weeks.

435
00:26:08.775 --> 00:26:11.027
and you got
all your sports updates right there.

436
00:26:11.111 --> 00:26:13.446
This thing is your airline ticket.
your Bible.

437
00:26:13.530 --> 00:26:15.740
your flashlight. your Rolodex.

438
00:26:15.824 --> 00:26:19.035
It's your music library.
it's a video arcade.

439
00:26:19.578 --> 00:26:21.871
It's a world-class camera.

440
00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:24.249
Some of you younger people
don't know this.

441
00:26:24.332 --> 00:26:26.585
Cameras used to be separate things.

442
00:26:26.668 --> 00:26:29.754
and you'd have to buy film
and put it in them.

443
00:26:30.255 --> 00:26:35.302
You'd take 24 pictures. having no idea
if they were good. bad. or out of focus.

444
00:26:35.385 --> 00:26:38.763
Then. when you'd taken all 24.
you'd take the film out of it.

445
00:26:38.847 --> 00:26:41.349
go to the drugstore.
and you'd give it to them.

446
00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:43.018
where they would process it.

447
00:26:43.101 --> 00:26:45.812
Then. after everybody
who worked at the drugstore

448
00:26:45.895 --> 00:26:48.773
had had an opportunity
to look at your pictures.

449
00:26:48.857 --> 00:26:51.693
they'd call you. and you'd go get them.

450
00:26:51.776 --> 00:26:53.445
And you knew they looked.
You pick them up.

451
00:26:53.528 --> 00:26:56.615
they're like. "When did y'all
go to the Grand Canyon?"

452
00:26:57.991 --> 00:26:59.868
"You son of a bitch."

453
00:27:03.455 --> 00:27:06.416
But see. back then.
pictures were precious.

454
00:27:06.499 --> 00:27:09.044
Even if they were out of focus
or somebody's head was cut off.

455
00:27:09.127 --> 00:27:10.545
you put them in a photo album

456
00:27:10.629 --> 00:27:13.798
'cause it was your only proof
that you had been somewhere.

457
00:27:13.882 --> 00:27:16.760
But now. you look at your picture.
if something's wrong with it.

458
00:27:16.843 --> 00:27:18.553
you delete it and take another one.

459
00:27:18.637 --> 00:27:20.388
So pictures are no longer precious.

460
00:27:20.472 --> 00:27:22.557
We just take pictures of everything.

461
00:27:22.641 --> 00:27:25.560
My daughters take pictures of their food.

462
00:27:26.102 --> 00:27:28.813
When we're in restaurants.
when the waiter puts their plate down.

463
00:27:28.897 --> 00:27:31.816
my daughters are like.
"Hold on. The camera eats first."

464
00:27:33.610 --> 00:27:37.656
They take a picture of their food
and send it to their friends.

465
00:27:37.739 --> 00:27:40.950
I'm like. "Hell. when I was growing up.
if you ate a delicious waffle.

466
00:27:41.034 --> 00:27:43.828
other people had
to take your word for it."

467
00:27:46.956 --> 00:27:49.501
This thing is amazing.
Do you know this thing.

468
00:27:49.584 --> 00:27:52.420
if it is lost it can find itself?

469
00:27:52.921 --> 00:27:55.215
Most of us need Jesus to do that.

470
00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:57.175
but not this joker.

471
00:27:59.094 --> 00:28:01.596
It can not only find itself.
it can find you.

472
00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.015
It can find anybody in your family.

473
00:28:04.099 --> 00:28:05.725
It's a world-class GPS.

474
00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:07.936
You put in it any direction

475
00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:10.689
to anywhere in the world.
it will take you right there to it

476
00:28:10.772 --> 00:28:14.567
and tell you. within the minute.
what time you're gonna get there.

477
00:28:14.651 --> 00:28:18.697
See. we didn't have GPS
back in the good old days. We had maps.

478
00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.866
We kept them
in the glove compartment of the car.

479
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:24.494
Nobody wanted to ever open them
because if you did.

480
00:28:24.577 --> 00:28:26.913
you never got it folded back down again.

481
00:28:26.996 --> 00:28:28.873
So we were always lost.

482
00:28:28.957 --> 00:28:30.917
Hell. when we went on family vacations.

483
00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.670
the only thing that was "recalculating"

484
00:28:33.753 --> 00:28:35.088
was our dad.

485
00:28:35.922 --> 00:28:38.675
"All right. kids. I have changed my mind."

486
00:28:39.259 --> 00:28:43.179
"Instead of going to Disney World.
we're all gonna go in this hardware store

487
00:28:43.263 --> 00:28:45.640
and have a look around. How about that?"

488
00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:52.021
This thing is amazing. This little thing

489
00:28:52.105 --> 00:28:54.899
is more powerful
than the biggest computers

490
00:28:54.983 --> 00:28:56.818
we had in the world in 1980.

491
00:28:56.901 --> 00:28:59.571
All the knowledge in the world
right at your fingertips.

492
00:28:59.654 --> 00:29:02.615
You wanna know how much
an elephant weighs. ask your phone.

493
00:29:02.699 --> 00:29:05.910
You wanna know how tall Tom Cruise is.
ask your phone.

494
00:29:05.994 --> 00:29:09.164
See. back in the good old days.
if we wanted to know something.

495
00:29:09.247 --> 00:29:11.583
we had to wait until our cheap-ass parents

496
00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:14.419
broke down and bought
a set of encyclopedias.

497
00:29:15.086 --> 00:29:18.548
And here was the deal.
you didn't get them all at one time.

498
00:29:18.631 --> 00:29:21.551
You made a down payment.
they'd give you the A volume.

499
00:29:21.634 --> 00:29:24.804
You keep making payments.
a few years later. you'd get the B.

500
00:29:24.888 --> 00:29:26.181
So that first year.

501
00:29:26.264 --> 00:29:30.059
you could talk
very intelligently about Antarctica.

502
00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:32.437
or aardvarks.

503
00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:35.774
But if you had to do
a school report on Zimbabwe.

504
00:29:35.857 --> 00:29:38.610
you were being held back another year.

505
00:29:39.652 --> 00:29:43.323
'Cause that Z volume wasn't coming
until you were in your thirties.

506
00:29:45.742 --> 00:29:48.411
And I don't know that having
all the knowledge in the world

507
00:29:48.495 --> 00:29:50.872
is necessarily a good thing.

508
00:29:50.955 --> 00:29:52.791
We're obsessed with it.

509
00:29:52.874 --> 00:29:55.710
Especially when it comes to medical stuff.

510
00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:57.587
Back in the good old days.

511
00:29:57.670 --> 00:30:00.215
people accepted aches and pains.

512
00:30:00.298 --> 00:30:04.469
It's just part of what went on
when you started getting old.

513
00:30:04.552 --> 00:30:08.598
But now. any time we have an ache or pain.
we gotta go google it.

514
00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:10.683
You can have a hangnail.
you're googling it.

515
00:30:10.767 --> 00:30:12.811
"What's the best way
to treat a hangnail?"

516
00:30:12.894 --> 00:30:15.980
"On rare occasions.
hangnails can be an indicator

517
00:30:16.064 --> 00:30:18.858
you've had an undiagnosed
cerebral hemorrhage."

518
00:30:21.486 --> 00:30:22.737
"Oh hell!"

519
00:30:24.113 --> 00:30:27.534
"What's wrong. Lloyd?"
"I'll tell you what's wrong. Connie."

520
00:30:27.617 --> 00:30:30.703
"Sixty seconds ago.
I didn't know I had a cerebral.

521
00:30:30.787 --> 00:30:33.706
and now. apparently.
the damn thing is hemorrhaged."

522
00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:40.588
You get scared to death
with medical stuff on your phone.

523
00:30:41.089 --> 00:30:43.049
You don't even have to be looking for it.

524
00:30:43.132 --> 00:30:45.009
I had a pop-up not long ago

525
00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:46.761
that said. "Low back pain

526
00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:50.598
can be an early indicator
of premature blindness."

527
00:30:52.642 --> 00:30:54.561
Hell. I've got low back pain.

528
00:30:55.436 --> 00:30:59.190
I thought it was because I helped my wife
rearrange the furniture in the den.

529
00:30:59.274 --> 00:31:00.608
Why did I move the couch?

530
00:31:00.692 --> 00:31:02.610
Now I'm just gonna run into it.

531
00:31:03.695 --> 00:31:08.449
I gotta get online and order a guide dog
while I can still find my laptop.

532
00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:16.833
Thing is ama-- it's a TV.
No excuse to ever miss the game anymore.

533
00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:20.503
How many guys. be honest. ever sat
during a wedding. phone on your lap.

534
00:31:20.587 --> 00:31:23.256
turn the volume down.
and watched the football game?

535
00:31:23.339 --> 00:31:25.008
Yeah. And it's porn.

536
00:31:25.091 --> 00:31:26.551
You don't have to be looking for it.

537
00:31:26.634 --> 00:31:29.596
There's so much porn in here.
it's looking for you.

538
00:31:31.014 --> 00:31:34.642
Not long ago. my wife and I were trying
to figure out where to go eat one night.

539
00:31:34.726 --> 00:31:37.353
I typed in "delicious Italian near me."

540
00:31:37.437 --> 00:31:38.271
I'm like…

541
00:31:44.944 --> 00:31:46.237
<i>Mamma mia.</i>

542
00:31:47.906 --> 00:31:50.325
That's a spicy meatball there.

543
00:31:52.994 --> 00:31:54.621
See. back in the good old days.

544
00:31:54.704 --> 00:31:59.834
porn was when of your friends
found a discarded <i>Playboy</i> magazine.

545
00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:03.129
And you would sneak it back
to the secret clubhouse in the woods.

546
00:32:03.713 --> 00:32:05.131
Therefore. the password.

547
00:32:07.133 --> 00:32:11.095
And maybe if you're into porn.
now is the good old days.

548
00:32:11.179 --> 00:32:14.807
because it took two hands
to hold that magazine

549
00:32:15.642 --> 00:32:18.353
but only one hand to hold your phone.

550
00:32:26.152 --> 00:32:27.362
And human beings.

551
00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:30.740
being able to corrupt
anything that is good.

552
00:32:30.823 --> 00:32:34.118
have found such naughty things
to do with this phone.

553
00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:37.455
People actually take
pictures of their private parts

554
00:32:37.538 --> 00:32:39.499
and send them to other people.

555
00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:42.669
which is such a fabulous idea.

556
00:32:43.586 --> 00:32:47.465
What could possibly go wrong
with an idea like that?

557
00:32:48.174 --> 00:32:49.926
See. back in the good old days.

558
00:32:50.009 --> 00:32:55.056
if I had wanted to send my girlfriend
a picture of my private parts.

559
00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:58.267
I would've had to have found
a piece of notebook paper.

560
00:32:58.351 --> 00:33:00.895
put it on the edge of the kitchen table.

561
00:33:00.979 --> 00:33:03.606
waited until nobody else was home.

562
00:33:03.690 --> 00:33:06.067
ran over to the table. dropped my pants.

563
00:33:06.150 --> 00:33:08.236
lay junior on the paper.

564
00:33:08.319 --> 00:33:10.738
take a pencil. and trace him out.

565
00:33:11.447 --> 00:33:14.075
Then. I would've had
to get a box of crayons.

566
00:33:14.158 --> 00:33:16.327
and it would've had
to be the 64-count box.

567
00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:18.830
because it was the only one
that had flesh tone in it.

568
00:33:20.081 --> 00:33:23.459
color it in. fold that paper up.
put it in an envelope.

569
00:33:23.543 --> 00:33:27.130
address it to my girlfriend.
put a stamp on it. walk down the driveway.

570
00:33:27.213 --> 00:33:29.799
and put it in the mailbox
to mail it to her.

571
00:33:29.882 --> 00:33:32.844
so three days later
she could call me and go.

572
00:33:32.927 --> 00:33:36.222
"Why did you send me
a drawing of your thumb?"

573
00:33:45.982 --> 00:33:49.027
Just not the sexy effect
you're looking for.

574
00:33:51.446 --> 00:33:54.032
One of the things
I missed the most during COVID

575
00:33:54.115 --> 00:33:56.659
was this. being on the road.
I love to travel.

576
00:33:56.743 --> 00:33:58.369
My wife loves to travel.

577
00:33:58.453 --> 00:34:01.914
and when it became evident that
we weren't going anywhere for a while.

578
00:34:01.998 --> 00:34:05.376
my wife ordered
a bunch of travel magazines<i>.</i>

579
00:34:05.460 --> 00:34:08.921
So one night I'm sitting at home.
flipping through one of her magazines.

580
00:34:09.005 --> 00:34:10.965
and I found an article in there

581
00:34:11.049 --> 00:34:12.925
that was written by a woman

582
00:34:13.009 --> 00:34:17.930
trying to teach other women
how to pack for a ten-day trip

583
00:34:18.014 --> 00:34:20.850
using only a carry-on suitcase.

584
00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.312
Let me repeat that. A woman

585
00:34:25.354 --> 00:34:27.398
packing for ten days

586
00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:30.151
using only a carry-on suitcase.

587
00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:33.571
And I thought.
"What woman is she talking about?"

588
00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:35.323
"Barbie?"

589
00:34:36.407 --> 00:34:41.871
My wife couldn't pack for a nudist colony
in a carry-on suitcase.

590
00:34:43.247 --> 00:34:46.084
And now the airlines
only let you take one carry-on.

591
00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:48.252
If I'm with my wife. she'll have two.

592
00:34:48.336 --> 00:34:50.922
and I have
whatever I can fit in my pockets.

593
00:34:52.381 --> 00:34:55.176
But I thought it was interesting.
because we live in an age

594
00:34:55.259 --> 00:34:57.762
where people try
to make everything sexist.

595
00:34:57.845 --> 00:35:01.474
that this article was just written
to women. She didn't say men.

596
00:35:01.974 --> 00:35:04.018
I think men could do
ten days in a carry-on.

597
00:35:04.102 --> 00:35:05.728
-Could you do it?
-Oh yeah.

598
00:35:05.812 --> 00:35:06.646
I could do it.

599
00:35:06.729 --> 00:35:10.024
You might be burning the socks
and underwear. but I could do it.

600
00:35:11.234 --> 00:35:14.779
'Cause I think most men
probably pack like I pack.

601
00:35:14.862 --> 00:35:18.950
I'll walk in my closet and think.
"I'm about to be out for three days."

602
00:35:19.033 --> 00:35:23.287
"Three days means three pairs of socks.
three pairs of underwear. three shirts.

603
00:35:23.371 --> 00:35:26.082
another pair of jeans
in case I spill something on these.

604
00:35:26.165 --> 00:35:28.376
toothbrush. razor blade.
Boom. ready to go."

605
00:35:28.459 --> 00:35:30.586
"Ten seconds of well-thought-out packing."

606
00:35:32.755 --> 00:35:34.173
That's how I pack.

607
00:35:36.259 --> 00:35:39.011
Now. when I go on vacation with my wife…

608
00:35:39.512 --> 00:35:43.808
And let me say this right up front.
I love being on vacation with my wife.

609
00:35:43.891 --> 00:35:48.479
'cause my wife is a lot more "friendly"
on vacation than she is at home.

610
00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:53.526
Something about having numbers
on the doors seems to light her fire.

611
00:35:54.110 --> 00:35:56.696
The same girl
that won't look at me twice at home.

612
00:35:56.779 --> 00:35:59.991
you get numbers on the door.
she is hanging the trapeze

613
00:36:00.074 --> 00:36:02.618
before the bell hop's to the ice machine.

614
00:36:04.787 --> 00:36:08.040
Love being on vacation with my wife.

615
00:36:08.124 --> 00:36:11.711
It's getting to vacation
that is the challenge.

616
00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:15.506
because it takes my wife
longer than ten seconds to pack.

617
00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:17.717
It takes her days to pack.

618
00:36:18.467 --> 00:36:21.220
Because she has outfits.

619
00:36:21.929 --> 00:36:24.974
There's not a man in this room
that has an outfit.

620
00:36:25.933 --> 00:36:28.853
But my wife has to put together an outfit

621
00:36:28.936 --> 00:36:31.647
for every day we're gonna be gone.

622
00:36:31.731 --> 00:36:35.401
Plus additional outfits. in case
we go out somewhere nice to dinner.

623
00:36:35.484 --> 00:36:39.280
Plus reserve outfits.
in case some of the starters get hurt.

624
00:36:39.363 --> 00:36:42.700
So this takes a lot of time and work.

625
00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:46.078
So two or three days
before we're even supposed to leave.

626
00:36:46.162 --> 00:36:48.789
my wife will start
pulling clothes out of the closet.

627
00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:50.958
and she'll lay them on the bed

628
00:36:51.042 --> 00:36:54.045
like Flat Stanley mannequins.

629
00:36:54.629 --> 00:36:56.505
And she just stares at them.

630
00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.930
Sometimes she'll call me in.
"Come here. I need your help."

631
00:37:05.306 --> 00:37:09.435
"Okay. I am down to these two outfits.
Which one do like the best?"

632
00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.230
The one on the left.

633
00:37:13.147 --> 00:37:14.523
"Are you kidding me?"

634
00:37:16.859 --> 00:37:19.028
"What's wrong with the one on the right?"

635
00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:22.531
"Nothing wrong with it.
I just like the one on the left."

636
00:37:25.451 --> 00:37:27.453
"I love that one on the right."

637
00:37:28.454 --> 00:37:30.748
"Now that I start thinking about it.

638
00:37:30.831 --> 00:37:33.334
I think I really like
that one on the right."

639
00:37:33.417 --> 00:37:34.752
"No. you don't."

640
00:37:35.711 --> 00:37:37.255
"You're just saying that."

641
00:37:37.797 --> 00:37:39.715
"Now I don't know what to do."

642
00:37:40.216 --> 00:37:43.052
"I know what to do.
I'm gonna go jump in front of a bus."

643
00:37:43.135 --> 00:37:45.680
"You stand here
and stare at this for a while."

644
00:37:48.307 --> 00:37:49.976
And the difference between us

645
00:37:50.059 --> 00:37:53.020
is once I have my clothes packed.
I'm packed.

646
00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:56.107
With my wife. her clothes.

647
00:37:56.190 --> 00:37:58.734
that's just the foundation.

648
00:37:59.443 --> 00:38:01.737
Her packing is like an archaeological dig.

649
00:38:01.821 --> 00:38:03.864
There's many. many layers to it.

650
00:38:04.365 --> 00:38:07.827
Because once she has
all the outfits picked out.

651
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:11.038
now she has to go back
and pick out the jewelry

652
00:38:11.122 --> 00:38:14.208
that goes with each particular outfit.

653
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:16.168
If you watch <i>Court TV.</i>

654
00:38:16.252 --> 00:38:19.213
that's what they call
the jewelry selection process.

655
00:38:21.757 --> 00:38:23.926
Next layer is the shoes.

656
00:38:24.010 --> 00:38:25.678
The shoes take a long time.

657
00:38:25.761 --> 00:38:27.888
She doesn't like to be
apart from her shoes.

658
00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:30.558
She spends longer
picking shoes for vacation

659
00:38:30.641 --> 00:38:33.102
than we spent
picking names for our children.

660
00:38:33.936 --> 00:38:37.898
I hope to God she never has
to choose between her shoes and me.

661
00:38:38.607 --> 00:38:42.862
'Cause I could see the surgeon going.
"Mrs. Foxworthy. we can save Jeff's life.

662
00:38:42.945 --> 00:38:44.488
but in order to do it.

663
00:38:44.572 --> 00:38:47.283
you would have
to get rid of all of your shoes."

664
00:39:10.222 --> 00:39:12.600
"He said he wants to be cremated."

665
00:39:15.728 --> 00:39:18.564
"I'm gonna need
some new shoes for that ceremony."

666
00:39:23.235 --> 00:39:25.988
Next layer is the electronics.

667
00:39:26.072 --> 00:39:27.114
Because one time.

668
00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:30.242
we went on vacation
and the hotel didn't have a hairdryer.

669
00:39:30.326 --> 00:39:33.621
So now my wife never packs a suitcase
without packing a hairdryer.

670
00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:35.998
But she also packs a hair curler

671
00:39:36.082 --> 00:39:37.583
and a hair straightener.

672
00:39:39.043 --> 00:39:41.712
I'm like.
"Don't they cancel each other out?"

673
00:39:42.338 --> 00:39:45.508
Then. she will pack
that lighted makeup mirror

674
00:39:45.591 --> 00:39:49.095
where one side has 12 times magnification.

675
00:39:49.887 --> 00:39:54.767
Nobody needs to look at their face
magnified 12 times.

676
00:39:55.267 --> 00:40:00.731
At 12 times magnification.
a wrinkle looks like an irrigation ditch.

677
00:40:01.232 --> 00:40:04.235
a blackhead looks like a manhole cover.

678
00:40:04.735 --> 00:40:07.530
and God forbid she find a chin hair.

679
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:11.492
You're not getting a girl out the door
that sees something on her chin

680
00:40:11.575 --> 00:40:14.370
that looks like
the anchor rope to a battleship.

681
00:40:16.372 --> 00:40:19.125
Do you know I have never.
ever looked at my face

682
00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:21.419
in the 12 times magnification mirror?

683
00:40:22.545 --> 00:40:25.256
Okay. to be totally honest.
a couple of times.

684
00:40:25.339 --> 00:40:26.757
I did get out of the shower

685
00:40:26.841 --> 00:40:29.301
and pause in front of it
just for a minute.

686
00:40:40.646 --> 00:40:44.233
<i>Buenos días. Señor Enchilada Grande.</i>

687
00:40:50.781 --> 00:40:53.784
Next layer for my wife.
it's a total feminine phenomenon.

688
00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:56.370
It's the "just in case" layer.

689
00:40:57.079 --> 00:41:00.499
She'll always pack
a little raincoat and her travel umbrella.

690
00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:02.501
just in case it rains.

691
00:41:03.043 --> 00:41:04.628
I'm like. "I checked the forecast.

692
00:41:04.712 --> 00:41:07.256
there's less than a 5% chance
any day we're there."

693
00:41:07.339 --> 00:41:08.591
"Okay. fine."

694
00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:11.969
"I don't know
what you're gonna do if it rains."

695
00:41:12.678 --> 00:41:15.389
I'm like. "I do.
I'll probably go back inside."

696
00:41:17.057 --> 00:41:19.560
She'll always pack
a sweater or a light jacket.

697
00:41:19.643 --> 00:41:23.272
just in case it gets cold at night.

698
00:41:23.772 --> 00:41:27.151
As it so often does in Orlando in July.

699
00:41:29.528 --> 00:41:31.947
Anybody else have
a wife or girlfriend that does this?

700
00:41:32.031 --> 00:41:37.453
My wife will pack
a collapsible. soft-sided suitcase

701
00:41:38.078 --> 00:41:40.623
inside of the hard-sided suitcase.

702
00:41:41.207 --> 00:41:43.000
People pointing at each other.

703
00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:48.380
"Just in case
I buy something while we're there."

704
00:41:49.131 --> 00:41:51.008
And if you're a gambling man.

705
00:41:51.091 --> 00:41:54.428
take the over on my wife
buying something while we're there.

706
00:41:54.512 --> 00:41:57.806
And I have never looked
inside the collapsible suitcase.

707
00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:02.603
but I'm willing to bet there's a smaller
collapsible suitcase inside of it.

708
00:42:03.771 --> 00:42:06.899
My wife always loads up
a gallon Ziploc bag full of medicine.

709
00:42:06.982 --> 00:42:09.527
just in case somebody gets sick.

710
00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:12.446
One time. I was playing in Buffalo.
it's. like. February.

711
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:14.990
They had snow up to here.
I had a bit of a headache.

712
00:42:15.074 --> 00:42:16.575
I go unzip the medicine bag.

713
00:42:16.659 --> 00:42:18.827
we've got malaria pills.

714
00:42:20.412 --> 00:42:24.291
Thankfully missed the great
malaria outbreak in Buffalo that winter.

715
00:42:25.125 --> 00:42:27.461
And I tell her.
"Baby. I love you to death."

716
00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:31.882
"This is where your packing
just starts getting out of control."

717
00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:36.011
So the last time we're getting ready
for vacation. I walked in the bedroom.

718
00:42:36.095 --> 00:42:39.139
I caught her rooting through my suitcase.

719
00:42:39.223 --> 00:42:41.225
She pulled out a five-pound bag of oats.

720
00:42:41.308 --> 00:42:44.228
She's like. "Uh-huh. What is this for?"

721
00:42:44.311 --> 00:42:45.771
I said. "Oh. that?"

722
00:42:46.272 --> 00:42:47.731
I said. "That

723
00:42:47.815 --> 00:42:51.902
is just in case the two donkeys
we're gonna need to carry your luggage

724
00:42:51.986 --> 00:42:53.737
get hungry while we're gone."

725
00:43:03.122 --> 00:43:06.000
And actually she packs light
for airline travel

726
00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:08.711
as opposed to
if we're going on vacation in the car.

727
00:43:08.794 --> 00:43:10.754
If we're going on vacation in the car.

728
00:43:10.838 --> 00:43:14.174
there's a fine line
between packing and moving.

729
00:43:15.884 --> 00:43:19.305
But my wife and daughters
think it is their obligation

730
00:43:19.388 --> 00:43:22.266
to fill that SUV to the roof.

731
00:43:22.349 --> 00:43:26.437
And the way they pack a car
would make a man lay on the floor and cry.

732
00:43:27.187 --> 00:43:30.649
They'll bring out a bag with bread
and potato chips. put it on the bottom.

733
00:43:30.733 --> 00:43:32.985
then put three suitcases on top of it.

734
00:43:33.819 --> 00:43:37.197
I'm like. "If you want me to live.
please let me do this."

735
00:43:38.907 --> 00:43:42.119
'Cause there's an art
to packing the car. is there not?

736
00:43:42.620 --> 00:43:45.080
My dad taught me. you do suitcase Tetris.

737
00:43:45.164 --> 00:43:47.791
Flip them. spin them.
turn them upside down.

738
00:43:47.875 --> 00:43:49.126
When he would get finished.

739
00:43:49.209 --> 00:43:53.756
you couldn't get a piece of notebook paper
between anything in that vehicle.

740
00:43:53.839 --> 00:43:57.760
My dad could get a house full of furniture
into the trunk of a Buick.

741
00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:02.306
"Hold the jack. hand me the piano.
I got this son of a gun now!"

742
00:44:03.682 --> 00:44:06.477
And like my daddy.
once I get that car packed.

743
00:44:07.102 --> 00:44:08.354
I'm ready to go.

744
00:44:09.063 --> 00:44:10.105
Not my wife.

745
00:44:10.606 --> 00:44:12.316
"No. we can't go yet."

746
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:14.818
"The car's packed. Why can't we go?"

747
00:44:14.902 --> 00:44:17.404
"Because I gotta straighten up the house."

748
00:44:18.530 --> 00:44:20.074
"Wait. do what?"

749
00:44:20.157 --> 00:44:22.409
"I'm not gonna be able to have a good time

750
00:44:22.493 --> 00:44:25.913
if I know I'm gonna be
coming back to a messy house."

751
00:44:34.338 --> 00:44:37.800
"Why didn't you straighten it up
the last couple of days?"

752
00:44:37.883 --> 00:44:40.803
"Because I had to pack."

753
00:44:42.096 --> 00:44:45.766
Which. in a nutshell.
is why men die before women.

754
00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:48.435
Because we want to.

755
00:44:54.024 --> 00:44:56.902
We have been married for 36 years.

756
00:44:56.985 --> 00:44:59.488
My wife still… Thank you.

757
00:45:04.493 --> 00:45:06.745
She still doesn't understand

758
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:10.290
that my primary objective.
when going on vacation in the car.

759
00:45:10.374 --> 00:45:13.669
is to get to wherever we are going

760
00:45:13.752 --> 00:45:16.463
in the shortest recorded time
in human history.

761
00:45:17.005 --> 00:45:18.674
That's all I'm trying to do.

762
00:45:18.757 --> 00:45:20.175
I've learned through the years.

763
00:45:20.259 --> 00:45:22.803
my wife's objective
on a vacation trip in the car

764
00:45:22.886 --> 00:45:25.848
is to consume enough liquid

765
00:45:25.931 --> 00:45:29.476
where she will have to pee
every 15 minutes.

766
00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:32.312
therefore destroying my objective.

767
00:45:33.147 --> 00:45:35.691
And my wife will never
have to go to the bathroom

768
00:45:35.774 --> 00:45:37.693
until we've just passed an exit.

769
00:45:39.027 --> 00:45:42.197
Then she's like.
"I gotta go. and I gotta go really bad."

770
00:45:42.281 --> 00:45:46.118
I'm like. "You will really
get your chance in 44 miles

771
00:45:46.201 --> 00:45:48.537
'cause that's how far it is
to the next exit."

772
00:45:51.331 --> 00:45:53.542
Well. she will not go between exits.

773
00:45:54.126 --> 00:45:57.171
And every man in this room
has been between exits.

774
00:45:58.964 --> 00:46:00.758
Nobody had to teach us how to do it.

775
00:46:00.841 --> 00:46:03.302
We came out of the womb
with this knowledge.

776
00:46:03.886 --> 00:46:06.180
You pull the car off
to the side of the road. get out.

777
00:46:06.263 --> 00:46:09.183
and you check the air
in the right front tire.

778
00:46:26.366 --> 00:46:28.160
It's that easy. isn't it?

779
00:46:29.077 --> 00:46:31.330
And. ladies. you could do this.

780
00:46:31.413 --> 00:46:35.501
Yes. you could. Change it from
the right front to the right rear tire.

781
00:46:59.274 --> 00:47:01.693
I hope you guys have had fun tonight.

782
00:47:01.777 --> 00:47:02.986
You know. it's…

783
00:47:09.243 --> 00:47:10.118
Thanks.

784
00:47:12.704 --> 00:47:14.915
Yeah. I'm such a blessed man

785
00:47:14.998 --> 00:47:17.751
because I've gotten
to do this for a long time.

786
00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:19.795
I've gotten to do
a lot of different things.

787
00:47:19.878 --> 00:47:21.630
whether it's write books.

788
00:47:21.713 --> 00:47:25.342
or host <i>Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader?</i>
Or different things.

789
00:47:25.425 --> 00:47:27.594
So I've never been bored.

790
00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:30.931
But if anybody put a gun to my head
and said. "You gotta pick one thing."

791
00:47:31.014 --> 00:47:34.142
without hesitation it would be doing this.

792
00:47:34.226 --> 00:47:38.438
I love stand-up because
this is what I see when I do this.

793
00:47:42.442 --> 00:47:45.028
"That's what you do. You do that."

794
00:47:45.112 --> 00:47:48.031
And every night I'm like.
"Thank God it's not just my family."

795
00:47:48.115 --> 00:47:50.117
"Other people are doing this too."

796
00:47:54.788 --> 00:47:57.040
None of us have it figured out.

797
00:47:57.124 --> 00:47:59.418
Everybody's family is crazy.

798
00:48:00.878 --> 00:48:04.214
The only negative thing
I've ever found about this job

799
00:48:04.298 --> 00:48:06.300
is you're on the road by yourself.

800
00:48:06.383 --> 00:48:10.095
Which was why doing something like
the <i>Blue Collar Comedy Tour</i> was so fun.

801
00:48:10.178 --> 00:48:13.098
'cause I wasn't on the road by myself.
I was with my buddies.

802
00:48:15.225 --> 00:48:19.521
People will always say.
"I bet y'all have so many funny stories

803
00:48:19.605 --> 00:48:22.482
from when you're on the road together."
There's a ton of them.

804
00:48:22.566 --> 00:48:25.027
I'm not gonna tell one on the other guys.

805
00:48:25.110 --> 00:48:27.654
because they're not here
to give their side of it

806
00:48:27.738 --> 00:48:29.406
and make it twice as funny.

807
00:48:29.489 --> 00:48:31.033
But I will tell you

808
00:48:32.534 --> 00:48:35.579
one funny road story about me

809
00:48:35.662 --> 00:48:37.998
that we can leave on tonight. So.

810
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:42.044
not the summer of 2020.
the summer of 2019.

811
00:48:42.544 --> 00:48:45.464
I was doing a bunch of summer dates
with Larry the Cable Guy.

812
00:48:45.547 --> 00:48:48.634
And in the summer. you get used…

813
00:48:48.717 --> 00:48:49.760
Git-R-Done.

814
00:48:52.429 --> 00:48:54.890
So when you do shows in the summer.

815
00:48:54.973 --> 00:48:57.643
you get used to being hot
because it's usually.

816
00:48:57.726 --> 00:49:00.395
you know. festivals. or fairs.

817
00:49:00.479 --> 00:49:01.605
or amphitheaters.

818
00:49:01.688 --> 00:49:05.609
We did a music festival in Phoenix.

819
00:49:05.692 --> 00:49:09.655
It was 112 degrees the day we did it.

820
00:49:09.738 --> 00:49:11.698
The promoter's trying
to make us feel good.

821
00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:13.784
"Come on. y'all. it's a dry heat."

822
00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:18.038
I'm like. "So is the electric chair.
It's 112."

823
00:49:19.831 --> 00:49:23.293
But Larry and I did this show one night.
and it was in the South.

824
00:49:23.377 --> 00:49:25.045
I won't tell you the name of the city

825
00:49:25.128 --> 00:49:27.714
because somebody's probably
talented enough to go online

826
00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:30.509
and find a security camera
that could verify this.

827
00:49:31.927 --> 00:49:34.054
But it wasn't just hot. it was humid.

828
00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:36.723
And you can see. I don't sweat very much.

829
00:49:36.807 --> 00:49:39.434
But this night. ten minutes into the show.

830
00:49:39.518 --> 00:49:42.312
I am dripping.
I mean. it's just dripping off my nose.

831
00:49:42.396 --> 00:49:46.650
Thirty minutes into the show.
I look like I'm in a wet T-shirt contest.

832
00:49:46.733 --> 00:49:50.529
Like somebody sprayed me with a fire hose.
I don't think I've ever sweated that much.

833
00:49:50.612 --> 00:49:52.864
So when the show was over.

834
00:49:52.948 --> 00:49:55.367
I immediately go back to my dressing room

835
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:58.328
and start guzzling Gatorade
and water. trying to rehydrate.

836
00:49:58.412 --> 00:50:01.707
And we hardly ever eat before a show
'cause it kinda makes you sluggish.

837
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:04.751
so we're always hungry
when the show is over.

838
00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:07.421
So I'm in my dressing room
chugging the Gatorade.

839
00:50:07.504 --> 00:50:10.173
and I hear Larry the Cable Guy
coming down the hall.

840
00:50:10.257 --> 00:50:14.136
He swings into my doorway
and he's like. "Hey. let's go eat."

841
00:50:14.219 --> 00:50:16.888
And Larry says this a lot.

842
00:50:18.932 --> 00:50:22.060
And I usually go
'cause it's fun to watch Larry eat.

843
00:50:22.144 --> 00:50:23.270
I mean. he can go.

844
00:50:23.770 --> 00:50:27.232
But you know. when you get too hot.
you don't feel like doing anything.

845
00:50:27.315 --> 00:50:30.027
And I said. "Dude.
I got too hot tonight. I'm not hungry."

846
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:32.779
"I think I'll go
back to the hotel and go to bed."

847
00:50:32.863 --> 00:50:34.906
He's like. "Are you kidding me?"

848
00:50:35.741 --> 00:50:40.954
He goes. "I cannot wait
until you ask me to do something for you."

849
00:50:43.081 --> 00:50:45.167
I'm like. 'What are you. nine years old?"

850
00:50:46.126 --> 00:50:49.129
"This isn't personal. I just got too hot."

851
00:50:49.212 --> 00:50:52.215
So I got in the van.
and they took me back to the hotel.

852
00:50:52.299 --> 00:50:56.762
Anybody that makes their living
on the road. you have your little routine.

853
00:50:56.845 --> 00:51:00.974
I always like it really dark in the room.
so I'll turn the lights down low.

854
00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:03.685
I like it cool.
I'll turn the thermostat down.

855
00:51:03.769 --> 00:51:06.271
But every day you're changing cities.

856
00:51:06.354 --> 00:51:08.523
and every hotel room
is a little bit different.

857
00:51:08.607 --> 00:51:10.150
So one of my tricks is.

858
00:51:10.233 --> 00:51:13.403
I'll always turn the lights on
in the bathroom and shut the door.

859
00:51:13.487 --> 00:51:15.572
If I have to get up
in the middle the night.

860
00:51:15.655 --> 00:51:19.701
at least I can orient
what this particular hotel room is like.

861
00:51:19.785 --> 00:51:22.120
And I usually sleep in my underwear.

862
00:51:22.204 --> 00:51:24.372
but this night they're soaking wet.

863
00:51:25.665 --> 00:51:28.502
And I told you.
I only pack three pairs. so…

864
00:51:29.711 --> 00:51:31.797
I'm like. "I'm not sleeping
in wet underwear."

865
00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:34.841
So I peel them off.
and I flop in the bed naked and I'm out.

866
00:51:35.425 --> 00:51:37.928
I wake up about 1:30 in the morning

867
00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:40.972
and I really. really. really have to pee.

868
00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:43.308
Any guy over 40
knows what I'm talking about.

869
00:51:43.391 --> 00:51:45.811
You have to pee
too much to go back to sleep.

870
00:51:45.894 --> 00:51:47.896
There's no way you're going back to sleep.

871
00:51:47.979 --> 00:51:50.065
But you don't really wanna wake up.

872
00:51:50.148 --> 00:51:54.027
You just wanna go get this act over with
and get back in the bed.

873
00:51:54.111 --> 00:51:57.989
I get up. I got my eyes about half open.
I see the light. and I walk in there.

874
00:51:58.073 --> 00:52:00.492
As soon as the door closes. I realize

875
00:52:00.575 --> 00:52:02.160
I'm in the hall…

876
00:52:08.667 --> 00:52:12.838
of a really nice hotel
without a stitch of clothes on.

877
00:52:14.714 --> 00:52:17.926
You wanna wake up in a hurry.
this is the way to do it.

878
00:52:18.844 --> 00:52:21.346
Forget coffee. this is much faster.

879
00:52:22.722 --> 00:52:25.851
So I'm standing there
with nothing on in the hall.

880
00:52:25.934 --> 00:52:29.354
I'm like Matt Damon in <i>The Martian.</i>
"Solve the problem."

881
00:52:30.438 --> 00:52:34.526
I knew Larry's room
was straight across the hall from mine.

882
00:52:35.235 --> 00:52:38.363
So I run over there
and I'm knocking on his door.

883
00:52:38.446 --> 00:52:39.656
He's not answering.

884
00:52:39.739 --> 00:52:43.451
I can just picture him
peeking through the keyhole and laughing.

885
00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:48.123
As I'm knocking on his door.
I hear the elevator ding.

886
00:52:49.624 --> 00:52:51.084
I'm like. "I got a 50-50 shot.

887
00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:54.087
they're either coming my way.
or they're going the other way."

888
00:52:54.171 --> 00:52:57.090
These two Korean guys get off.
they're talking to each other.

889
00:52:57.174 --> 00:53:00.093
they turn.
and they start heading right to me.

890
00:53:00.177 --> 00:53:02.262
I'm like. "All right. what do you do?"

891
00:53:02.345 --> 00:53:04.514
"Act like nothing's up." So…

892
00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:07.392
I start walking towards them.

893
00:53:08.393 --> 00:53:11.897
Literally pass them in the hall.
I'm like. "Hey. how are you doing?"

894
00:53:13.356 --> 00:53:15.567
And one of them said something.

895
00:53:16.067 --> 00:53:19.905
which I really hoped meant.
"Wow. that was impressive."

896
00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:24.951
But when I looked it up on Translator.
I found out it meant.

897
00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:27.078
"Did you see her mustache?"

898
00:53:36.213 --> 00:53:39.466
So I knew I couldn't get on the elevators.

899
00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:41.885
I know elevators have cameras on them.

900
00:53:41.968 --> 00:53:46.014
I don't want to get on the elevators
and I'm like. "What the heck do I do?"

901
00:53:46.097 --> 00:53:51.144
Well. I saw the exit sign
over the door for the stairwell.

902
00:53:51.228 --> 00:53:54.272
I'm like.
"At least get out of the lighted hallway

903
00:53:54.356 --> 00:53:57.108
into the stairwell
and then try to come up with a plan."

904
00:53:57.192 --> 00:54:01.363
I'm hoping. as I'm running down the hall.
that there will be a trash can there

905
00:54:01.446 --> 00:54:05.659
with a trash bag that I can pull out
and wear like a sundress or something.

906
00:54:06.493 --> 00:54:09.579
So I get into the stairwell.
and there's no trash can.

907
00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:13.375
And I'm trying to think
my way through what to do.

908
00:54:13.458 --> 00:54:17.170
and I notice there are
a couple of empty beer cans on the floor.

909
00:54:18.004 --> 00:54:22.384
Well. the reason I got up
in the first place was I had to pee.

910
00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:28.807
I have no idea how long
I'm going to be in this stairwell.

911
00:54:28.890 --> 00:54:30.475
and I'm not proud of this.

912
00:54:30.558 --> 00:54:33.770
but I picked those beer cans up
and I peed in them

913
00:54:33.853 --> 00:54:35.230
and put them back.

914
00:54:37.232 --> 00:54:39.109
I feel terrible about it.

915
00:54:39.776 --> 00:54:43.488
'Cause I know somewhere down the road
somebody's gonna have to clean them up.

916
00:54:43.571 --> 00:54:45.115
But it was Old Milwaukee.

917
00:54:45.198 --> 00:54:49.452
and I figured they'll pick them up and go.
"Yeah. that's Old Milwaukee all right."

918
00:54:56.376 --> 00:54:59.254
But. like I said.
this was a really nice hotel.

919
00:54:59.337 --> 00:55:01.965
So they had 24-hour room service.

920
00:55:02.048 --> 00:55:07.512
And I thought. "Maybe somebody has put
their room service tray outside the door

921
00:55:07.595 --> 00:55:10.932
and I can get that cloth napkin
that they put on it

922
00:55:11.016 --> 00:55:14.144
and wear it like
a Tarzan thing or whatever."

923
00:55:14.227 --> 00:55:17.480
So I start going down the stairwell

924
00:55:17.564 --> 00:55:19.316
and stopping at every floor

925
00:55:19.399 --> 00:55:23.028
and looking down the hall
to see if I can see a room service tray.

926
00:55:23.111 --> 00:55:26.323
I get down about.
I don't know. two or three floors

927
00:55:26.406 --> 00:55:28.575
and I don't see a room service tray.

928
00:55:28.658 --> 00:55:32.537
but I see two pizza boxes
outside somebody's room.

929
00:55:32.620 --> 00:55:35.790
At this point.
they look like a tuxedo to me.

930
00:55:37.083 --> 00:55:39.586
So I run down the hall.
pick up the pizza boxes.

931
00:55:39.669 --> 00:55:41.296
I go back to the stairwell.

932
00:55:41.379 --> 00:55:44.799
and I go down the last couple of floors
and never find a room service tray.

933
00:55:44.883 --> 00:55:48.053
but by now. it's really late.
It's like two in the morning.

934
00:55:48.136 --> 00:55:51.431
And from the lobby level.
I can crack the door open.

935
00:55:51.514 --> 00:55:54.392
I can see almost the entire lobby.
I don't see anybody.

936
00:55:54.476 --> 00:55:56.186
I don't hear anybody talking.

937
00:55:56.269 --> 00:55:59.189
I think. "All right.
be brave for 20 seconds."

938
00:55:59.272 --> 00:56:01.858
I got one box in the front.
one in the back.

939
00:56:02.567 --> 00:56:03.860
and I go skidding.

940
00:56:05.612 --> 00:56:08.281
I go up to the desk.
there's this woman working there.

941
00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:10.700
As I approach. she looks up and goes…

942
00:56:13.953 --> 00:56:15.121
"Can I help you?"

943
00:56:16.206 --> 00:56:17.707
'Yes. ma'am. you can."

944
00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:21.169
I said. "I accidentally
locked myself out of my room.

945
00:56:21.252 --> 00:56:23.922
can I just get another key.
so I can get back in?"

946
00:56:24.005 --> 00:56:24.881
And she goes.

947
00:56:25.423 --> 00:56:27.592
"Do you have any identification?"

948
00:56:29.803 --> 00:56:32.722
I said. "I do.
but it's in my other pizza box."

949
00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:37.268
"No. I locked myself out of my room.
I have nothing."

950
00:56:37.352 --> 00:56:39.354
And she said. "Well…

951
00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.233
I think I'm gonna need to call a manager."

952
00:56:43.316 --> 00:56:44.984
And she goes behind the wall.

953
00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:48.988
I'm thinking. "She's not calling
a manager. She's calling the cops."

954
00:56:49.572 --> 00:56:53.576
But it's 2:00 in the morning. I'm naked
with a pizza box in front of my junk.

955
00:56:53.660 --> 00:56:55.078
What am I gonna do?

956
00:56:55.161 --> 00:56:56.371
And as I'm waiting.

957
00:56:56.454 --> 00:56:59.833
all of a sudden.
the front doors to the hotel slide open.

958
00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:02.710
and in walks Larry the Cable Guy

959
00:57:02.794 --> 00:57:04.462
and our tour manager.

960
00:57:06.464 --> 00:57:09.884
And I'm like. "Thank you. God!
This is answered prayer."

961
00:57:09.968 --> 00:57:13.388
They come walking across the lobby.
Again. I am naked.

962
00:57:13.471 --> 00:57:15.473
holding a pizza box.

963
00:57:16.474 --> 00:57:19.686
Larry walks up. he doesn't say.
"My gosh. bud. what happened to you?"

964
00:57:19.769 --> 00:57:22.147
He looked at me. looked at the pizza box.

965
00:57:22.230 --> 00:57:25.150
he goes.
"I thought you said you wasn't hungry."

966
00:57:31.489 --> 00:57:35.034
"I've been sitting here
naked in the lobby eating pepperoni."

967
00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:39.205
I said. "Dude. I accidentally
locked myself out of my room."

968
00:57:39.289 --> 00:57:41.791
About that time.
here comes the front desk lady back.

969
00:57:41.875 --> 00:57:44.377
and now she's got
a security guard with her.

970
00:57:44.878 --> 00:57:49.215
I said. "Larry. I need you to do me
a favor. Please tell her who I am.

971
00:57:49.299 --> 00:57:51.843
so she can give me a key
and I can get back in my room."

972
00:57:55.263 --> 00:57:57.432
He looked at me.
he looked at her. and goes.

973
00:57:57.515 --> 00:58:01.978
"I have never seen him before
in my entire life."

974
00:58:02.479 --> 00:58:05.190
And he got on the elevator and went up.

975
00:58:07.567 --> 00:58:10.778
Now. thankfully.
the security guard burst out laughing.

976
00:58:11.362 --> 00:58:12.864
He recognized both of us.

977
00:58:12.947 --> 00:58:15.867
This was the nicest guy
I think I've ever met in my life.

978
00:58:15.950 --> 00:58:20.497
He got the emergency key. rode up
the elevator with me and the pizza box.

979
00:58:21.414 --> 00:58:23.541
and walked me down the hall.
let me in my room.

980
00:58:23.625 --> 00:58:24.542
I said. "Wait here."

981
00:58:24.626 --> 00:58:27.086
I went and got my wallet.
I gave him a $100 bill.

982
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:29.714
I'm like. "Thank you so much."

983
00:58:29.797 --> 00:58:33.218
"Please never tell anybody about this."

984
00:58:33.843 --> 00:58:36.304
And now I'm telling y'all for free.

985
00:58:37.722 --> 00:58:41.142
So I got back in my room.
put on my sweatpants and my T-shirt.

986
00:58:41.226 --> 00:58:43.937
made sure
I had that room key in my pocket.

987
00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:45.980
and I waited about ten minutes.

988
00:58:46.064 --> 00:58:49.317
And I walk back across the hall
and I knock on Larry's door.

989
00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:52.946
He opens the door. he's still laughing.

990
00:58:53.821 --> 00:58:54.656
He's like…

991
00:58:56.908 --> 00:58:59.160
He said. "I told you I couldn't wait

992
00:58:59.244 --> 00:59:02.747
until you asked me
to do something for you."

993
00:59:10.922 --> 00:59:12.966
I said. "All right. you got me."

994
00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:14.342
I said. "Are we even?"

995
00:59:14.425 --> 00:59:17.554
He's like. "Yeah. we're even."

996
00:59:17.637 --> 00:59:20.348
I said. "Just to prove
I don't have any hard feelings.

997
00:59:20.431 --> 00:59:22.225
I went and got you a beer."

998
00:59:24.477 --> 00:59:26.145
You guys have been so great.

999
00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:27.647
God bless you!

1000
00:59:28.189 --> 00:59:30.775
Be safe. Take care of each other.

1001
00:59:31.442 --> 00:59:33.903
Thank you for coming out.
You guys are the best.
