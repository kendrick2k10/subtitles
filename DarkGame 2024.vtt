how to break it.

Sweet. And who's with him now?

364
00:17:48.583 --> 00:17:51.256
-My mom.
-Ah. she moved here as well.

365
00:17:51.711 --> 00:17:54.501
Yeah. that's what

366

Yes.

Hey.

391
00:20:49.869 --> 00:20:51.126
I know you're scared...

392
00:20:52.476 --> 00:20:53.839
but try not to make a sound.

393
00:20:54.131 --> 00:20:55.251
Don't move.

We're not allowed to talk.

395
00:20:59.053 --> 00:21:01.668
We think
the cameras are above us...

396
00:21:02.418 --> 00:21:05.626
so we can communicate a little
if we lie like this.

397

No movement. Just whispers.

398
00:21:09.328 --> 00:21:10.883

It's okay. Katia.

406
00:21:31.424 --> 00:21:32.476
You can do this.

407
00:21:33.375 --> 00:21:35.565
They're going to be watching now
as you've just come in.

408

for a while.

412

to get out of here.

413
00:21:46.024 --> 00:21:47.715
Because that's what
we're gonna do.

is prehistoric by now.

-I think so.
-No social media?

As much protection
as he gives himself.

that's the weak link.

at some point.

has to meet the outside wall.

nut. one spigot.

-No.
-Aw.

475
00:25:16.267 --> 00:25:18.334

is not the whole picture.

and a lethal injection.

off your face.

What else
am I gonna do for pleasure?

491
00:25:58.292 --> 00:25:59.834
Look. I did what I did

492
00:25:59.875 --> 00:26:01.737
on my dark web network
for my entertainment.

493
00:26:01.789 --> 00:26:04.709
This guy. well. he's doing it
for everyone else's.

494
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:06.334
He's a showman. that's for sure.

495
00:26:06.375 --> 00:26:07.822
-I wouldn't call him that.
-He would.

496
00:26:07.884 --> 00:26:09.105
So I won't.

497
00:26:09.417 --> 00:26:11.292
-You wanna provoke him?
-No.

498
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.584
-I wanna kill him.
-Oh.

499
00:26:13.945 --> 00:26:16.292
I think you'll have to play
his game a little longer.

500
00:26:16.334 --> 00:26:17.369
No.

501
00:26:17.430 --> 00:26:19.292
-That's your ego talking.
-Fuck you.

502
00:26:19.334 --> 00:26:20.642
Oh. and now it's shouting.

503
00:26:21.309 --> 00:26:23.702
You wanna go over like you did
with me. full-on attack mode?

504
00:26:23.714 --> 00:26:25.592
I'm a coward. Ben.
that's why it worked.

505
00:26:25.624 --> 00:26:26.757
But this guy.

506
00:26:26.869 --> 00:26:28.662
I think you'll have to go under
to even get through.

507
00:26:28.684 --> 00:26:31.427
But the question is.
are you the man to do that?

508
00:26:32.909 --> 00:26:34.334
We're not talking about me.

509
00:26:35.084 --> 00:26:36.375
We're talking about the feed.

510
00:26:37.339 --> 00:26:40.694
It won't help you to keep thinking of him
as a killer or evil incarnate.

511
00:26:41.380 --> 00:26:42.649
He's a showman.

512
00:26:43.837 --> 00:26:46.452
And that's not a job title.
it's a psychological need.

513
00:26:47.117 --> 00:26:48.459
[sucking teeth]

514

Christ.
I'm giving you gold here.

515
00:26:50.625 --> 00:26:53.334
but without a life fee there's not
much more I can tell you.

516
00:26:55.944 --> 00:26:57.265
You're looking good. Ben.

517
00:26:57.929 --> 00:26:59.235
Actually. why did I say that?

518
00:26:59.277 --> 00:27:01.459
That's a total lie.
You're looking haunted.

519
00:27:01.700 --> 00:27:03.210
You know when I killed one
it wasn't enough.

520
00:27:03.242 --> 00:27:04.909
Two. yeah. kinda maybe.
but still not enough.

521
00:27:04.970 --> 00:27:06.834
No number was enough.
would ever be enough.

522
00:27:06.875 --> 00:27:10.125
Some things
just can't be satiated. but you know that.

523
00:27:10.167 --> 00:27:12.500
Me killing. you saving.
it's the same problem. right?

524
00:27:12.542 --> 00:27:13.809
Never enough
to scratch that itch

525
00:27:13.830 --> 00:27:15.209
so it goes away for good.

526
00:27:15.250 --> 00:27:16.834
[laughing]

527
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:20.792
Two reports
of the same missing person.

528
00:27:20.834 --> 00:27:22.584
One from the store
where she works.

529
00:27:22.625 --> 00:27:24.500
-one from her mother.
-The new contestant.

530
00:27:24.672 --> 00:27:26.625
Katia Volkova. Russian.

531
00:27:26.767 --> 00:27:27.959
Arrived here a year ago.

532
00:27:28.555 --> 00:27:30.184
Last night.
the night she was taken.

533
00:27:30.355 --> 00:27:32.750
that was her first day working at the
Campbell's Landing jewelry store.

534
00:27:32.792 --> 00:27:36.125
We spoke with her boss there and the last
person to see her before the abduction.

535
00:27:36.167 --> 00:27:37.660
a colleague. Sofia Romana.

536
00:27:37.932 --> 00:27:40.044
They went for a few
first-day celebration drinks.

537
00:27:40.605 --> 00:27:41.629
Where?

538
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:43.167
Little joint
on 21st and Bay Tree.

539
00:27:43.429 --> 00:27:46.042
All right. pull security footage
from the bar in the local area.

540
00:27:46.234 --> 00:27:47.235
What about the mother?

541
00:27:47.877 --> 00:27:49.149

about your daughter.

552
00:28:22.917 --> 00:28:24.102
She is alive.

553
00:28:24.164 --> 00:28:27.792
We can't say
who has her or where.

554
00:28:27.834 --> 00:28:29.375

Could you tell us
about any of her friends?

559

This is first time
she been out in months.

560
00:28:43.117 --> 00:28:44.667
I-- I was happy for her.

561
00:28:44.839 --> 00:28:47.230
I was hoping it was a young man.

562
00:28:48.844 --> 00:28:50.334
So she talked about a young man.

563
00:28:50.375 --> 00:28:53.084
No. no.
I just want her to be happy.

564
00:28:53.285 --> 00:28:54.752

[Ben] Better she doesn't.

570
00:29:12.702 --> 00:29:13.875

[suspenseful music playing]

572
00:29:30.870 --> 00:29:31.972
This is it.

573
00:29:32.222 --> 00:29:33.787
I'll get forensics down here.

574
00:29:34.459 --> 00:29:37.001
It's a long shot.
but maybe they were sloppy.

575
00:29:46.961 --> 00:29:48.134
[Katia] Ah!

576
00:29:50.209 --> 00:29:51.459

A genuine Russian
joining our lovely game.

580
00:30:10.916 --> 00:30:12.029
How are you feeling?

581
00:30:14.506 --> 00:30:16.138
How do you think I feel?

582
00:30:17.566 --> 00:30:20.071
I know a little fearful.
a little cautious.

583
00:30:20.476 --> 00:30:22.155
Maybe. though. there's a thrill of
excitement

584
00:30:22.239 --> 00:30:23.834
that you wouldn't wanna admit to.

585
00:30:24.896 --> 00:30:26.168
What's your favorite color?

We wanna get to know you.

588
00:30:32.223 --> 00:30:34.216

Tell me.

601
00:31:10.208 --> 00:31:11.238

doesn't know his father.

603
00:31:15.624 --> 00:31:16.964
I want him to know his mom.

[Cathy] So what do we know
so far?

625
00:32:37.346 --> 00:32:40.183
Katia Volkova.
32. Born in Russia.

626
00:32:40.254 --> 00:32:42.739
Came to the US last year
with her son Lev. now six.

627
00:32:43.279 --> 00:32:46.156
Lives at an East Portland address
registered to her mother. Inga.

628
00:32:46.468 --> 00:32:49.376
Started a new job at the Campbell's
Landing jewelry store two days ago.

629
00:32:50.959 --> 00:32:52.257
Blue. Sasha Morgan.

630
00:32:52.299 --> 00:32:54.716
who we also know that we know
nothing about his disappearance

631
00:32:54.777 --> 00:32:56.104
or his movements before that.

632
00:32:57.417 --> 00:33:00.167
White. Alex Chambers.
delivery driver.

633
00:33:00.208 --> 00:33:01.612
Taken on the night of the 11th.

634
00:33:03.298 --> 00:33:06.167
Red. Chloe Demaine.
substitute teacher.

-Anything connecting?
-Not that we know of so far.

641
00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.483
We know they're all local.

642
00:33:20.525 --> 00:33:23.350
so they aren't searching
too far field for their target victims.

643
00:33:23.462 --> 00:33:25.542
And we don't think
that this is money-motivated.

644
00:33:25.733 --> 00:33:27.560
None of the captives
are particularly wealthy.

645
00:33:28.262 --> 00:33:29.662
So anyone could be
the next target.

646
00:33:29.773 --> 00:33:31.583
I don't want the media
getting their hands on this.

647
00:33:31.805 --> 00:33:33.520
If the full details
of this goes public.

648
00:33:34.092 --> 00:33:35.500
that'll play
right into his game plan.

Not from the IP.
We're invisible.

we were undetectable.

812

I told you
he'd be expecting this.

or the setup is seriously.

You gotta hand it
to Mr. White there.

1256
01:08:48.612 --> 01:08:50.957
That was bold. ballsy.

1257
01:08:51.148 --> 01:08:53.000
Made me rethink things.

1258
01:08:54.535 --> 01:08:58.207
And I want to honor him
for the samurai he is.

1259
01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:01.458
No. not Samurai. exactly.

1260
01:09:02.428 --> 01:09:04.457

But who's it gonna be?

1265
01:09:21.844 --> 01:09:24.298

And I'll choose
to kill 'em both.
