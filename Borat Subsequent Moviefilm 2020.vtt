1233
01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:58.489
I came here on a simple mission
to save my country by delivering

1234
01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:01.450
our number one televiski star
Johnny the Monkey

1235
01:01:01.533 --> 01:01:04.161
as a gift to Michael Pence.

1236
01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:06.622
And I’m sure you’ve figured out
what happen next.

1237
01:01:06.705 --> 01:01:11.377
My daughter had smuggled herself
into the crate.

she’d eaten the monkey.
