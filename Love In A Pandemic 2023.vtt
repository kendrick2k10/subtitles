00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:19.792
<i>We all have our COVID story.</i>

4
00:00:19.958 --> 00:00:22.667
Some. sad. Some. happy.

5
00:00:22.958 --> 00:00:25.083
But one thing is certain…

6
00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:28.833
nothing has remained the same ever since.

7
00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.375
<i>For me. I started off as chubby Bolanle</i>.

8
00:00:33.917 --> 00:00:35.250
<i>a customer care rep</i>.

9
00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:37.750
And by the time the lockdown was over...

10
00:00:38.042 --> 00:00:41.625
...I was on
a completely different path.

11
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.000
This is my COVID story.

12
00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:49.583
This is how I found love in a pandemic.

13
00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:08.792
<i>It started off like</i>
<i>every other day in Lagos.</i>

14
00:01:10.958 --> 00:01:14.208
<i>People going about their day.</i>
<i>hustling their hustle.</i>

15
00:01:17.458 --> 00:01:21.083
Uh… right. sir. I really am sorry
about the inconvenience.

16
00:01:21.792 --> 00:01:24.083
Of course. I understand your frustration.

17
00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:26.792
You want us to send a new device?

18
00:01:27.583 --> 00:01:30.500
Well sir. that's not a problem
but could you do me a favor?

19
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.208
Could you look at the back of the device
to be sure that it's properly coupled?

20
00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:36.875
Just from the back of it. Mm-hmm...

21
00:01:37.792 --> 00:01:42.583
Ha-ha. I thought as much. Oh.
for nothing. I'm happy to be of help.

22
00:01:43.042 --> 00:01:45.875
Have a wonderful day. sir.
Thank you so much for calling.

23
00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:47.583
Okay. bye.

24
00:01:48.417 --> 00:01:51.750
Hello. good morning.
Thank you for calling JJ logistics.

25
00:01:51.917 --> 00:01:55.208
My name is Bolanle.
How can I be of help to you today. sir?

26
00:01:56.667 --> 00:01:59.917
Uh-uh. Mm-hmm.

27
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.542
Okay.

28
00:02:03.917 --> 00:02:05.542
Oh okay. sir.

29
00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:07.583
Mm-hmm.

30
00:02:10.458 --> 00:02:12.208
Uh. yes. I'm… I'm with you. sir.

31
00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm with you. I'm with you.
Just one minute.

32
00:02:16.625 --> 00:02:18.667
Okay. sir. What's happening?

33
00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:20.542
I don't know. I don't know.

34
00:02:22.417 --> 00:02:25.083
Yes sir. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

35
00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:28.333
Sir. is it fine if I call you back. sir?

36
00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:30.167
Please.

37
00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:32.208
Yeah. yeah. I'll call you back. I promise.

38
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.500
Thank you. sir. Thank you.

39
00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:55.167
<i>And just like that.</i>
<i>our lives were changed forever.</i>

40
00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:58.875
<i>COVID was real. And it was here in Lagos.</i>

41
00:03:00.083 --> 00:03:03.833
<i>We were scared.</i>
<i>wondering what was going to happen next.</i>

42
00:03:37.292 --> 00:03:39.000
I guess you all have heard the news.

43
00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:42.417
The pandemic is officially in Lagos.

44
00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:46.000
There’s no need to panic.

45
00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:49.750
Let’s hope that very soon
this pandemic will be over.

46
00:03:51.792 --> 00:03:54.292
So. just pack up your systems. go home…

47
00:03:54.417 --> 00:03:57.458
if there's any new development.
you all will be informed individually.

48
00:03:57.792 --> 00:04:00.042
-Okay?
-Okay. sir. Thank you. sir.

49
00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:08.583
<i>I can't lie</i>.

50
00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:11.792
<i>I didn't think COVID</i>
<i>would affect me like this.</i>

51
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.125
<i>But I knew I wasn't looking forward</i>
<i>to being alone in my house.</i>

52
00:04:54.958 --> 00:04:57.583
What's up. Bolanle? Are you not going?

53
00:04:57.917 --> 00:04:58.917
Yeah. I am.

54
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.792
-Alright now. Take care.
-Okay.

55
00:05:10.292 --> 00:05:12.042
<i>And why didn't I want to go home?</i>

56
00:05:12.792 --> 00:05:13.833
<i>You'll see.</i>

57
00:05:23.875 --> 00:05:25.875
<i>While Lagos was going crazy.</i>

58
00:05:26.083 --> 00:05:30.208
<i>all I wanted to do was just</i>
<i>buy supplies and get home.</i>

59
00:06:01.208 --> 00:06:03.083
<i>This is a covid 19 testing centre…</i>

60
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.833
Oh my God!

61
00:06:29.833 --> 00:06:30.958
What?!

62
00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:33.750
Wow.

63
00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:37.375
O my God. Aby!

64
00:06:43.292 --> 00:06:45.208
Aby!

65
00:06:45.542 --> 00:06:47.833
<i>Sis! I'm in a meeting. I'll call you back</i>

66
00:06:47.917 --> 00:06:50.125
Okay. okay. okay. But just don't
stress yourself too much. okay?

67
00:06:50.208 --> 00:06:51.333
Don't stress. okay?

68
00:06:51.958 --> 00:06:53.000
<i>Bye bye</i>.

69
00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:54.833
Oh my God.

70
00:06:55.917 --> 00:07:01.917
Finally!

71
00:07:04.333 --> 00:07:05.333
What's this?

72
00:07:08.583 --> 00:07:11.125
<i>I was scared</i>
<i>because my TJ was a doctor.</i>

73
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:14.208
<i>and I thought I was going</i>
<i>to be alone during the lockdown.</i>

74
00:07:14.875 --> 00:07:17.750
<i>But maybe.maybe I was wrong</i>.

75
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:33.250
This boy just knows how
much I love sweet things.

76
00:07:33.375 --> 00:07:34.833
-Hey baby.
-Hey.

77
00:07:34.917 --> 00:07:35.917
Hey.

78
00:07:36.667 --> 00:07:37.667
You’re here.

79
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:38.875
Yes. I am. Surprise.

80
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.417
O my God. you smell so good.

81
00:07:43.542 --> 00:07:45.208
You smell better.

82
00:07:46.042 --> 00:07:47.833
Okay. I need to go clean up first.

83
00:07:47.958 --> 00:07:50.042
-Corona is in town.
-Oh no. no. That's big news. isn't it?

84
00:07:50.167 --> 00:07:52.458
-For a medical doctor. Remember?
-A nasty medical doctor.

85
00:07:52.542 --> 00:07:54.708
Oh. the nastiest.

86
00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:56.750
-I need to go to the bathroom.
-Can I follow you?

87
00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:58.500
-No! No.
-Please.

88
00:07:58.583 --> 00:08:03.542
-I need to shower.
-<i>I can't lie. I love that boy</i>.

89
00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:08.125
<i>Have you told Marcus. already?</i>

90
00:08:08.667 --> 00:08:11.000
Hmm. He can’t contain his joy.

91
00:08:11.292 --> 00:08:13.458
He's been picking names
for a boy since then.

92
00:08:13.917 --> 00:08:16.250
And it's been less than
24 hours we found out.

93
00:08:16.458 --> 00:08:18.958
but he's just been
disturbing me with different names.

94
00:08:19.042 --> 00:08:24.000
Sis. you have no idea
how happy I am for you.

95
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.458
I think I should come see you already.

96
00:08:26.667 --> 00:08:28.833
<i>No. Please stay</i>
<i>in your house for the lockdown.</i>

97
00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:30.792
<i>They say it won't take too long.</i>

98
00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:33.292
Hmm. I think it will.

99
00:08:33.832 --> 00:08:35.332
Uh-uh. Why did you say that?

100
00:08:35.457 --> 00:08:38.457
<i>I just have that feeling.</i>
<i>I'm already working from home.</i>

101
00:08:39.417 --> 00:08:40.417
Hey babe.

102
00:08:42.625 --> 00:08:44.167
Hey. Bolanle.

103
00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:46.917
So. you've been quarantining
with a man in the house?

104
00:08:47.333 --> 00:08:49.042
I’ll call you back. hmm?

105
00:08:51.333 --> 00:08:53.250
Mmh.

106
00:08:53.667 --> 00:08:55.833
Uh-uh. See this girl.

107
00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:01.583
Hmm.

108
00:09:04.292 --> 00:09:06.083
-Hey. Was that your sister?
-Mm-hmm.

109
00:09:06.458 --> 00:09:07.875
Uh-uh. why won't you let me talk to her?

110
00:09:10.042 --> 00:09:12.500
You’ll get your chance.
you’re here all weekend. So. yeah.

111
00:09:13.125 --> 00:09:16.167
Hmm. that is so good.

112
00:09:27.333 --> 00:09:28.458
Who is that?

113
00:09:28.708 --> 00:09:30.708
Uh. nobody important. Just the hospital.

114
00:09:33.958 --> 00:09:35.292
The hospital.

115
00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:38.125
So. you’re leaving?

116
00:09:39.208 --> 00:09:40.208
Yeah. babe.

117
00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:41.458
When?

118
00:09:42.583 --> 00:09:44.167
Give or take. before noon.

119
00:09:45.833 --> 00:09:47.542
You’re not even spending a day with me?

120
00:09:53.417 --> 00:09:55.167
<i>My worse fear was happening.</i>

121
00:09:56.292 --> 00:09:58.125
<i>I was going to be alone in the pandemic.</i>

122
00:09:58.750 --> 00:10:00.083
Can I see the message?

123
00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:05.458
-What’s that now?
-I said. can I see the message?

124
00:10:05.917 --> 00:10:07.042
Are you serious?

125
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:08.917
Do I look like I'm joking?

126
00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.583
Stop. please. Um. um. stop.

127
00:10:23.667 --> 00:10:24.875
Are you cheating on me?

128
00:10:26.917 --> 00:10:28.375
What kind of question
is that one again now?

129
00:10:28.458 --> 00:10:32.750
-I said. are you cheating on me?
-I said. what kind of question is this?

130
00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:35.417
A few moments ago you were
all happy. all giggly and now.

131
00:10:35.833 --> 00:10:38.458
a message came in and your mood
has changed. you have to leave?

132
00:10:38.542 --> 00:10:41.125
-The hospital called.
-Then let me see.

133
00:10:43.875 --> 00:10:46.208
Let. Me. See.

134
00:10:47.125 --> 00:10:48.917
You know what. don't worry.

135
00:10:49.708 --> 00:10:51.208
There we go again.

136
00:10:51.542 --> 00:10:52.667
You come to my house.

137
00:10:52.875 --> 00:10:56.542
you have sex with me. eat my food
then tell me that the hospital called.

138
00:10:56.667 --> 00:10:59.750
-There is a pandemic outside.
-Don’t give me that pandemic line. TJ.

139
00:11:00.167 --> 00:11:01.625
I'm a human being too.

140
00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:03.792
I have feelings.

141
00:11:09.875 --> 00:11:12.708
You know what?
Your insecurity is not my fault.

142
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:24.250
It's fine. If you want to leave.
you can pack your stuff and go.

143
00:11:24.333 --> 00:11:25.500
Fine.

144
00:11:28.125 --> 00:11:29.958
-I didn’t mean that.
-Yes. you did.

145
00:11:39.792 --> 00:11:42.333
Obviously. in hindsight
I should have known.

146
00:11:42.792 --> 00:11:44.792
Huh! I mean. if my man
doesn't want to see me.

147
00:11:44.958 --> 00:11:47.167
then he's seeing
somebody else. right? Right?

148
00:11:48.167 --> 00:11:52.625
Bolanle. I was clearly in love.

149
00:11:53.458 --> 00:11:56.167
Or maybe my village people
were even following me. Who knows?

150
00:11:57.208 --> 00:11:59.792
Anyway though. let's keep going.

151
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:08.042
<i>So. to not think about TJ.</i>

152
00:12:08.333 --> 00:12:09.667
<i>I threw myself into work.</i>

153
00:12:19.583 --> 00:12:22.958

Of course. Delivery is
still in process. ma'am.

Yes. that will be all.
Thank you so much. Thank you.

165

Thank you for calling. madam.
Have a wonderful day.

166

00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:42.542
<i>But eventually. work finished.</i>

174
00:13:42.833 --> 00:13:45.625
<i>And I was alone. missing him.</i>

175
00:14:24.958 --> 00:14:26.208
Hello?

176
00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:28.750
Babe. I just…

177
00:14:30.125 --> 00:14:31.792
I know I messed up. okay?

178
00:14:32.375 --> 00:14:35.750
I'm sorry but it's not enough for you
to not be picking up my calls.

179
00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:37.875
or even replying my text messages.

180
00:14:39.417 --> 00:14:42.833
I’m just frustrated that
I'll be in this house 24/7 by myself.

181
00:14:43.458 --> 00:14:44.667
I was hoping that this pandemic

182
00:14:44.792 --> 00:14:47.917
would help us be even closer
and spend more time together but

183
00:14:48.333 --> 00:14:50.917
that's not happening.
So. I'm just frustrated.

184
00:14:52.208 --> 00:14:53.500
Can you hear me?

185
00:14:54.708 --> 00:14:55.708
<i>Yes I can.</i>

186
00:14:57.083 --> 00:14:58.083
Oh no!

187
00:15:00.375 --> 00:15:01.875
Shit! What am I doing?

188
00:15:06.083 --> 00:15:08.167
Oh shoot.

189
00:15:08.958 --> 00:15:09.958
Man.

190
00:15:14.917 --> 00:15:17.167
<i>Yep. I dialed the wrong number.</i>

191
00:15:17.667 --> 00:15:20.667
<i>I couldn't copy a number from</i>
<i>my personal phone to my work phone.</i>

192
00:15:21.583 --> 00:15:24.292
<i>Great job. Bolanle!</i>

193
00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:27.083
I'll just call back and apologize.

194
00:15:31.583 --> 00:15:32.583
<i>Hello?</i>

195
00:15:32.917 --> 00:15:36.042
Hi. I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean
to dial your number. okay? I was

196
00:15:36.417 --> 00:15:40.042
dialing my boyfriend's number but
then I missed the last digits. So sorry.

197
00:15:40.625 --> 00:15:42.250
<i>Are you a voiceover artist?</i>

198
00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:46.917
-Huh?
-<i>Your voice… There’s something about it.</i>

199
00:15:47.083 --> 00:15:49.667
<i>In fact. I wonder how anyone</i>
<i>would resist such a voice.</i>

200
00:15:50.958 --> 00:15:52.000
What about it?

201
00:15:52.958 --> 00:15:55.167
<i>It’s like mine. Special.</i>

202
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:57.500
How do you know your voice is special?

203
00:15:57.583 --> 00:15:59.000
<i>Because you’re still listening.</i>

204
00:16:00.667 --> 00:16:02.875
Well. I just wanted to say sorry
for disturbing your peace.

205
00:16:03.542 --> 00:16:04.917
Take care and have a good evening. sir.

206
00:16:05.042 --> 00:16:06.042
<i>Wait.</i>

207
00:16:09.958 --> 00:16:10.958
Hey babe.

208
00:16:14.208 --> 00:16:15.208
<i>What's up?</i>

209
00:16:15.458 --> 00:16:16.750
I'm good.

210
00:16:17.708 --> 00:16:18.917
Are you still mad at me?

211
00:16:20.583 --> 00:16:22.917
I’m sorry. Please.

212
00:16:23.333 --> 00:16:24.333
<i>It's fine.</i>

213
00:16:24.708 --> 00:16:26.167
<i>What's going on at your end? How are you?</i>

214
00:16:26.292 --> 00:16:28.333
I'm okay. Just at home.

215
00:16:29.083 --> 00:16:30.083
Alone.

216
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:32.250
You?

217
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.458
<i>Well. I'm very busy as well.</i>

218
00:16:34.667 --> 00:16:36.417
<i>Basically working double shifts at work.</i>

219
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.708
You know. we have a red alert
for COVID patients. so...

220
00:16:39.125 --> 00:16:40.458
<i>I know. right.</i>

221
00:16:41.375 --> 00:16:42.458
But are you okay?

222
00:16:42.792 --> 00:16:43.875
<i>Yeah. yeah. I'm good.</i>

223
00:16:44.708 --> 00:16:46.750
<i>Is there a reason that you called?</i>

224
00:16:47.167 --> 00:16:49.583
Yeah. I just wanted
to apologize

225
00:16:49.667 --> 00:16:51.208
<i>about the other day.</i>

226
00:16:51.625 --> 00:16:54.875
<i>And just check up on you.</i>
<i>It's been a while since we spoke.</i>

227
00:16:55.958 --> 00:16:58.375
Uh...

228
00:16:58.667 --> 00:16:59.792
Are you okay. babe?

229
00:16:59.958 --> 00:17:03.083
Yes. yes. You know what?
Apology accepted. It's all good.

230
00:17:03.333 --> 00:17:04.666
<i>Let me. uh… let's talk later.</i>

231
00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:06.125
What?!

232
00:17:08.666 --> 00:17:09.750
Who was that?

233
00:17:10.083 --> 00:17:11.708
Just a patient. my darling.

234
00:17:11.833 --> 00:17:13.041
-Oh.
-Mm-hmm.

235
00:17:13.166 --> 00:17:15.041
Okay. So. what did the patient want?

236
00:17:15.166 --> 00:17:16.458
They wanted medicine.

237
00:17:16.666 --> 00:17:18.416
Uh. what kind of medicine?

238
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.750
-This kind of medicine.
-Uh.

239
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.166
Bad boy.

240
00:17:23.291 --> 00:17:26.291
Worse girl.

241
00:17:26.875 --> 00:17:28.750
<i>Look at me. Mugu.</i>

242
00:17:29.292 --> 00:17:31.583
<i>Missing him</i>
<i>while he's enjoying his life. Hmm!</i>

243
00:17:55.042 --> 00:17:56.750
Jesus Christ.

244
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:07.792
<i>Anyway. if he didn't want to talk to me.</i>

245
00:18:08.042 --> 00:18:09.417
<i>I'll find someone else who did.</i>

246
00:18:19.958 --> 00:18:21.083
<i>Hello?</i>

247
00:18:22.250 --> 00:18:26.083
You’re right.
Your voice does sound cool... too.

248
00:18:26.375 --> 00:18:29.458
Apologies for rushing off just like that.

249
00:18:30.167 --> 00:18:32.708
That was the most fun conversation
I’ve had since corona.

250
00:18:33.583 --> 00:18:37.125
We probably would never talk again
but people should misdial more often.

251
00:18:37.458 --> 00:18:38.458
Yeah.

252
00:18:39.458 --> 00:18:40.458
Bye.

253
00:19:00.083 --> 00:19:02.125
Hello. good afternoon.

254
00:19:02.417 --> 00:19:05.708
My name is Bolanle. Thank you
so much for calling JJ Logistics.

255
00:19:05.875 --> 00:19:07.083
How may we help you today?

256
00:19:07.667 --> 00:19:11.333
Thank God you people finally have my time.

257
00:19:12.375 --> 00:19:14.083
Here is my issue.

258
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.375
Well. make sure you have pen and
paper so you can jot things down.

259
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.292
<i>Please hold on. Please hold on.</i>

260
00:19:24.833 --> 00:19:27.833
Please help. help me. My body is hot.

261
00:19:28.083 --> 00:19:30.792
I’ve been… I've been coughing.

262
00:19:31.042 --> 00:19:32.750
Now I can't… I can’t even breathe.

263
00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:34.333
-I can't breathe anymore. Please help me.
-<i>Please hold on.</i>

264
00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.708
Help me. Bolanle.
<i>-I said. hold on please!</i>

265
00:19:40.833 --> 00:19:42.208
<i>I'm back to you. sir.</i>

266
00:19:42.375 --> 00:19:46.167
Do you know that you people
are aiding fraud and corruption?

267
00:19:47.042 --> 00:19:48.208
<i>I'm sorry sir. what?</i>

268
00:19:50.125 --> 00:19:54.292
Clearly written here. in the
information panel of this soft drink.

269
00:19:55.833 --> 00:20:01.458
Do you know exactly what 90 grams
of sugar everyday does to men?

270
00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:03.167
Sir.

271
00:20:03.458 --> 00:20:05.375
JJ Logistics is a delivery company

272
00:20:05.542 --> 00:20:08.292
that specializes in delivering
products that <i>you</i> ordered for.

273
00:20:08.583 --> 00:20:12.000
Okay? If you have any problem
with any of the products.

274
00:20:12.167 --> 00:20:13.667
just call the customer care line

275
00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:17.458
<i>that is available</i>
<i>on the pack that you're holding.</i>

276
00:20:22.875 --> 00:20:24.500
Is there anything else
you'd like me to help you with?

277
00:20:24.667 --> 00:20:26.125
My friend is single and ready to mingle...

278
00:20:26.208 --> 00:20:28.208
I love… I love you. talk your own.

279
00:20:28.542 --> 00:20:32.958
Listen you dimwits. COVID is not
something that you play about. okay?

280
00:20:33.542 --> 00:20:34.833
<i>-If you don't--</i>
Get a life!

281
00:20:55.125 --> 00:20:56.125
<i>Hello?</i>

282
00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:59.208
Hello. um…

283
00:20:59.583 --> 00:21:02.750
<i>Er. it's Alex.</i>
<i>The guy with the special voice.</i>

284
00:21:05.042 --> 00:21:06.500
Did I call at a wrong time?

285
00:21:07.083 --> 00:21:08.500
<i>Depends on why you’re calling.</i>

286
00:21:09.542 --> 00:21:14.125
Okay. I called
to know your name. at least.

287
00:21:15.125 --> 00:21:16.667
It’s been two days.

288
00:21:16.958 --> 00:21:19.292
<i>Well. I was kinda</i>
<i>hoping you’d call first but</i>

289
00:21:19.583 --> 00:21:21.875
<i>I also figured I should</i>
<i>just act like a man.</i>

290
00:21:22.875 --> 00:21:23.958
What does that mean?

291
00:21:24.292 --> 00:21:26.625
You know. swallowing my pride to call back

292
00:21:26.792 --> 00:21:29.500
a stranger whom I met in
the most convenient way possible.

293
00:21:31.083 --> 00:21:34.792
Well. I don’t need anyone "acting
like a man" or whatever around me. okay.

294
00:21:35.125 --> 00:21:36.417
I already have a man.

295
00:21:36.625 --> 00:21:39.958
Ouch. A younger me
would have been heartbroken.

296
00:21:40.250 --> 00:21:42.583
<i>but I’m not trying to be your man.</i>

297
00:21:44.792 --> 00:21:45.792
Interesting.

298
00:21:46.208 --> 00:21:49.083
I told you.
the conversation with you

299
00:21:49.208 --> 00:21:51.958
was the most fun thing
in my life since the lockdown started.

300
00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:54.125
I’m not trying to <i>toast</i> you here.

301
00:21:54.458 --> 00:21:55.792
I’m trying to have a lockdown buddy.

302
00:21:57.208 --> 00:21:58.417
<i>Okay. How about this?</i>

303
00:21:59.250 --> 00:22:00.625
<i>You can call me whenever you’re bored.</i>

304
00:22:01.042 --> 00:22:03.208
<i>and I'll call you whenever I’m bored.</i>

305
00:22:04.292 --> 00:22:06.500
Why would I want
to call you anytime I’m bored?

306
00:22:06.833 --> 00:22:08.958
Cause we seem to have a vibe?

307
00:22:09.125 --> 00:22:10.333
I don't know.

308
00:22:10.708 --> 00:22:13.208
<i>Maybe just talk</i>
<i>to somebody who won’t judge you.</i>

309
00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:14.667
<i>for a change.</i>

310
00:22:20.833 --> 00:22:22.458
Today has actually been a long day.

311
00:22:24.042 --> 00:22:26.375
Hmm. Tell me more.

312
00:22:28.167 --> 00:22:31.292
This whole work from home thing
is taking a minute to get used to.

313
00:22:32.375 --> 00:22:33.417
I'm so sorry.

314
00:22:34.333 --> 00:22:36.625
Why are you sorry though?

315
00:22:37.583 --> 00:22:39.042
<i>For talking with my mouth full?</i>

316
00:22:39.875 --> 00:22:40.875
Uh…

317
00:22:41.042 --> 00:22:43.417
you do understand you're basically saying

318
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.417
you're sorry for being human. right?

319
00:22:46.833 --> 00:22:48.375
My boyfriend hates it.

320
00:22:48.708 --> 00:22:50.583
He thinks I'm adding too much weight.

321
00:22:51.375 --> 00:22:55.542
I don't agree.
I mean. you look great.

322
00:22:56.292 --> 00:22:58.958
<i>How do you know?</i>
<i>You've never seen me before.</i>

323
00:22:59.083 --> 00:23:00.542
I'm looking at you right now.

324
00:23:01.958 --> 00:23:04.208
What?! How?

325
00:23:04.417 --> 00:23:07.250
<i>Uh. there was this picture of you with um.</i>

326
00:23:07.875 --> 00:23:09.792
<i>some lady who looks just like you</i>

327
00:23:10.125 --> 00:23:12.292
<i>-You were wearing a green T-shirt.</i>
You're on my Instagram page?

328
00:23:12.583 --> 00:23:16.750
<i>Yep. And I just followed you.</i>

329
00:23:19.417 --> 00:23:20.875
Alex Esho.

330
00:23:22.625 --> 00:23:25.667
Alex. That is me.

331
00:23:27.417 --> 00:23:29.083
<i>Are you disappointed?</i>

332
00:23:30.208 --> 00:23:33.167
No. No. of course not.

333
00:23:34.542 --> 00:23:35.958
<i>Do you mind video-calling me?</i>

334
00:23:37.792 --> 00:23:40.083
What?! Come on. that's hilarious.

335
00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:41.792
Video-call me now.

336
00:23:42.667 --> 00:23:44.125
Else you're a bloody scammer.

337
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.167
Okay.

338
00:23:56.458 --> 00:23:57.542
Are you there?

339
00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.833
Mm-hmm.

340
00:24:03.542 --> 00:24:04.542
Hi. Alex.

341
00:24:04.958 --> 00:24:06.375
Hello. stranger.

342
00:24:09.667 --> 00:24:12.792
<i>Being in a relationship</i>
<i>with him is really complicated.</i>

343
00:24:14.250 --> 00:24:16.833
Some months back. things got really sour

344
00:24:17.125 --> 00:24:18.708
and I wanted to walk away

345
00:24:19.583 --> 00:24:23.958
but then he convinced me
to stay back and I stayed.

346
00:24:24.458 --> 00:24:26.042
And how did that go?

347
00:24:29.375 --> 00:24:31.833
You know. when I decided to walk away…

348
00:24:34.125 --> 00:24:35.667
I didn't really want to walk away.

349
00:24:36.417 --> 00:24:39.458
That's just me. I'm silly like that.

350
00:24:41.042 --> 00:24:42.375
Don't ever say that.

351
00:24:44.208 --> 00:24:46.917
I've put in a lot of work
into this relationship.

352
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:49.792
If I leave him. who will I date?

353
00:24:50.208 --> 00:24:51.208
Me?

354
00:24:55.417 --> 00:24:59.500
Look. you've made the best
of opportunities life has given you.

355
00:25:00.417 --> 00:25:02.625
Whoever is going to be
with you needs to see that.

356
00:25:06.167 --> 00:25:07.500
Hmm.

357
00:25:08.917 --> 00:25:10.417
Why are you so nice to me?

358
00:25:10.917 --> 00:25:13.708
Because we're friends. Bolanle.

359
00:25:14.167 --> 00:25:15.875
Friends are supposed
to be nice to each other.

360
00:25:16.375 --> 00:25:19.458
Hmm. If you're like this as friends.

361
00:25:19.792 --> 00:25:21.542
I wonder what you're like as a lover.

362
00:25:25.375 --> 00:25:29.000
Trust me. you don't wanna know.

363
00:25:31.292 --> 00:25:32.500
Really? Why's that?

364
00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.167
Look…

365
00:25:35.583 --> 00:25:37.792
I'm a man like him. okay so…

366
00:25:38.875 --> 00:25:43.125
maybe I could give you some insights
to what could repair your relationship.

367
00:25:44.125 --> 00:25:45.750
Really? What's that?

368
00:25:46.083 --> 00:25:47.208
Surprise him.

369
00:25:47.792 --> 00:25:49.125
With something nice.

370
00:25:49.417 --> 00:25:50.958
Busy men love surprises.

371
00:25:53.292 --> 00:25:54.875
I don't think I want to surprise him.

372
00:25:55.208 --> 00:25:56.625
Me too I want to be surprised.

373
00:25:56.917 --> 00:25:59.417
But that's it. You're the surprise.

374
00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:01.833
So. why don't you put some of this your

375
00:26:01.958 --> 00:26:04.583
beauty and intelligence
to romantic use for once.

376
00:26:05.208 --> 00:26:07.917
You know. cook him a nice meal.

377
00:26:09.042 --> 00:26:11.542
Wear that purple dress
that you put up on Instagram. right?

378
00:26:12.542 --> 00:26:15.417
Get out your best cologne
and just go find your man.

379
00:26:17.708 --> 00:26:18.708
<i>Plus…</i>

380
00:26:19.292 --> 00:26:22.250
going out there for some fresh air
would definitely improve your mood.

381
00:26:24.333 --> 00:26:26.125
Me I don't think I want to surprise him.

382
00:26:26.708 --> 00:26:28.708
If I do that now.
he'll think I'm begging him.

383
00:26:29.250 --> 00:26:31.042
Then it will make him even more proud.

384
00:26:31.875 --> 00:26:33.750
<i>No. And there's a curfew.</i>

385
00:26:34.292 --> 00:26:35.917
Forget about the curfew.

386
00:26:37.042 --> 00:26:38.833
Just do this this once. You know…

387
00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.833
go see him. Tell him how you feel.

388
00:26:42.208 --> 00:26:43.250
<i>Face to face.</i>

389
00:26:45.542 --> 00:26:48.000
A pandemic shouldn't stop you
from going to see the man that you love.

390
00:26:48.875 --> 00:26:50.125
Or are you afraid of COVID?

391
00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:51.667
I should be.

392
00:26:52.042 --> 00:26:54.542
People are dying out there.
Everyone should be afraid.

393
00:26:55.417 --> 00:26:56.792
Are you going to take my advice or not?

394
00:26:57.333 --> 00:26:58.333
Yes. I will.

395
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:04.125
There's someone at the door.

396
00:27:05.375 --> 00:27:06.750
I'll talk to you later. okay?

397
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:08.750
Alright?
<i>-Okay.</i>

398
00:27:09.292 --> 00:27:10.417
Bye.

399
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.292
Hi. baby.

400
00:27:29.125 --> 00:27:30.333
Hey.

401
00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.500
Hmm?

402
00:27:32.333 --> 00:27:33.708
What in the world are you doing here?

403
00:27:34.167 --> 00:27:36.583
What. so I can’t come here anymore? Huh?

404
00:27:37.042 --> 00:27:38.542
Or what? Is your sister in?

405
00:27:39.833 --> 00:27:41.542
-Uduak. you cannot be here.
-Yeah?

406
00:27:43.375 --> 00:27:45.750
-Alex. aren't you happy to see me?
-Obviously not.

407
00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:48.042
Well. I have nowhere else to go so…

408
00:27:48.208 --> 00:27:49.583
You have a house.

409
00:27:49.833 --> 00:27:51.542
But I’ll be bored.

410
00:27:52.042 --> 00:27:55.792
Hmm? And it's not like
you'll be there to keep me company. So…

411
00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.917
Well. I've missed you.

412
00:27:58.625 --> 00:28:00.667
-Uduak. you cannot do this.
-Please. please. please.

413
00:28:01.250 --> 00:28:02.750
stop acting like you don’t miss me.

414
00:28:03.042 --> 00:28:04.542
-Uduak. you…
-Huh?

415
00:28:14.292 --> 00:28:15.292
Hmm.

416
00:28:15.750 --> 00:28:17.708
Look at my sister making moves!

417
00:28:18.417 --> 00:28:20.333
Finally considering leaving that scum!

418
00:28:20.875 --> 00:28:21.917
<i>I didn't say I was</i>

419
00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.417
leaving TJ. I just said
I started talking to a stranger.

420
00:28:25.792 --> 00:28:27.292
Ah-ah. calm down.

421
00:28:27.583 --> 00:28:29.833
Do you want to hear my gist
or should I carry my problem and go?

422
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.708
Okay. continue.

423
00:28:32.083 --> 00:28:33.750
<i>Well. it was a misdial.</i>

424
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.667
What is that?

425
00:28:36.833 --> 00:28:40.000
Mis-dial means I mistakenly dialed him.

426
00:28:40.167 --> 00:28:41.167
And?

427
00:28:43.125 --> 00:28:46.667
And we were both embarrassed
but I got over it quickly.

428
00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.958
Is he single?

429
00:28:50.833 --> 00:28:52.917
How would I be asking
a stranger that kind of question?

430
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.792
Of course. I know.

431
00:28:59.333 --> 00:29:01.458
<i>You'll prefer TJ more than anybody else.</i>

432
00:29:01.750 --> 00:29:03.583
Why is this our morning topic please?

433
00:29:04.375 --> 00:29:06.167
Because you just met a new guy.

434
00:29:06.833 --> 00:29:09.000
I want you to receive him with open arms.

435
00:29:11.208 --> 00:29:13.500
<i>I have to go.</i>
<i>My other phone is ringing.</i>

436
00:29:14.125 --> 00:29:15.125
The new guy?

437
00:29:15.292 --> 00:29:16.458
<i>I’ll call you back. okay?</i>

438
00:29:19.208 --> 00:29:20.875
-Hey.
-Hey.

439
00:29:21.708 --> 00:29:22.708
<i>How are you?</i>

440
00:29:24.542 --> 00:29:26.708
I’m okay. You?

441
00:29:27.125 --> 00:29:29.167
Your voice sounds odd. Is everything good?

442
00:29:30.208 --> 00:29:32.000
<i>I'm just tired. Work stuff.</i>

443
00:29:33.125 --> 00:29:35.375
I thought working from
home would be easier but

444
00:29:36.208 --> 00:29:38.833
I've barely slept in days.

445
00:29:39.125 --> 00:29:42.625
<i>Someone listening to you now would think</i>
<i>you're searching for the cure to COVID.</i>

446
00:29:44.042 --> 00:29:46.750
People management is one
of the hardest jobs in the world.

447
00:29:47.958 --> 00:29:49.583
You have no idea how many mad people

448
00:29:50.167 --> 00:29:52.750
<i>are walking around with phones</i>
<i>in their hands in this country.</i>

449
00:29:53.333 --> 00:29:55.250
Really? What about my job?

450
00:29:55.667 --> 00:29:58.958
<i>That one is both physically</i> and mentally
demanding. What would you say about that?

451
00:29:59.333 --> 00:30:00.667
Whatever. please.

452
00:30:02.125 --> 00:30:03.542
I miss you really.

453
00:30:04.917 --> 00:30:06.125
Well. I know you do.

454
00:30:06.542 --> 00:30:08.250
How about you tell me how much.

455
00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.167
No. it’s not sex.

456
00:30:10.583 --> 00:30:13.667
<i>It's you. I miss you being around.</i>

457
00:30:13.958 --> 00:30:15.333
<i>talking to you.</i>

458
00:30:16.417 --> 00:30:17.417
I miss you.

459
00:30:18.375 --> 00:30:19.375
<i>Oh.</i>

460
00:30:21.333 --> 00:30:22.375
You don't miss me?

461
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.333
Uh. yeah.

462
00:30:25.417 --> 00:30:27.125
<i>yeah of course I did. I do…</i>

463
00:30:27.208 --> 00:30:29.625
I do miss you. So much. I miss you.

464
00:30:30.542 --> 00:30:32.250
<i>You want to know what else I really miss?</i>

465
00:30:32.542 --> 00:30:33.583
What?

466
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:36.667
<i>I really miss your jollof rice and that.</i>

467
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:38.208
ooh! that grilled chicken.

468
00:30:38.458 --> 00:30:40.708
I miss it.
<i>-Alright.</i>

469
00:30:40.792 --> 00:30:41.958
Well. you can come over.

470
00:30:42.042 --> 00:30:43.292
I'll make some for you.

471
00:30:43.708 --> 00:30:44.792
You know what. babe?

472
00:30:44.917 --> 00:30:48.042
I would love to but I just left
the hospital and I have to go home.

473
00:30:48.208 --> 00:30:49.583
Nobody can come to my house.

474
00:30:49.708 --> 00:30:52.333
I can't go to anybody's house
till I'm sure I have no symptoms.

475
00:30:53.167 --> 00:30:54.417
You get it. right?

476
00:30:54.708 --> 00:30:56.500
Yea. Sure.

477
00:32:05.083 --> 00:32:06.792
Good day. sir. Your package. sir.

478
00:32:07.042 --> 00:32:08.667
Uh. okay. How much is it?

479
00:32:08.875 --> 00:32:10.000
Aunty already paid. sir.

480
00:32:11.042 --> 00:32:12.042
Oh. Okay.

481
00:32:15.292 --> 00:32:18.167
Babe! I got lunch. Your fave.

482
00:32:24.625 --> 00:32:27.792
-Oh! Food is here!
-Yea babe. I got your fave. Here.

483
00:32:27.917 --> 00:32:30.333
-Thank you. Oh. come here.
-Yeah.

484
00:32:30.500 --> 00:32:31.917
-You want some?
-No. I'm good. Enjoy.

485
00:32:32.042 --> 00:32:33.542
-Are you sure?
-I'm good. I'm good. I promise.

486
00:32:33.625 --> 00:32:35.708
-All this for me? Oh.
-Yes.

487
00:32:49.958 --> 00:32:52.583
When I was eight. I was on a cooking show.

488
00:32:53.125 --> 00:32:54.667
The Young Culinarian.

489
00:32:54.917 --> 00:32:57.583
-<i>No way! Are you… are you serious?</i>
-Mm-hmm.

490
00:32:57.833 --> 00:33:01.000
<i>I watched that show. You… you actually</i>
<i>wanted to be a professional cook?</i>

491
00:33:01.875 --> 00:33:04.875
Yup. I'm surprised
the great Alex couldn’t tell.

492
00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.792
<i>You should apply to participate</i>
<i>in the Ultimate Chef Show.</i>

493
00:33:08.083 --> 00:33:09.208
<i>You know about it. right?</i>

494
00:33:09.542 --> 00:33:11.583
Yeah. but I’m too busy for that.

495
00:33:13.875 --> 00:33:17.833
I… I wish I was skilled at something more…

496
00:33:18.833 --> 00:33:20.542
intellectually challenging.

497
00:33:21.292 --> 00:33:23.542
<i>Look. cooking is one</i>
<i>of life’s basic essentials.</i>

498
00:33:24.083 --> 00:33:26.042
<i>It’s a gift when you are able</i>
<i>to make food delicious.</i>

499
00:33:26.167 --> 00:33:27.667
<i>I mean. some people.</i>
<i>no matter what they do.</i>

500
00:33:28.042 --> 00:33:30.042
<i>their food never comes out nice.</i>

501
00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:32.667
<i>People like me.</i>

502
00:33:33.958 --> 00:33:36.042
Fine. You win.

503
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:39.625
-It's a big deal.
-<i>Good! Good.</i>

504
00:33:45.375 --> 00:33:48.583
My goodness. We should
definitely hit the sack.

505
00:33:49.375 --> 00:33:51.417
<i>Yep. I’ll still be here. though.</i>

506
00:33:51.625 --> 00:33:54.125
<i>Chasing deadlines</i>
<i>on this online gig website.</i>

507
00:33:55.667 --> 00:33:58.333
That’s a thing?
<i>-Yes of course.</i>

508
00:33:58.458 --> 00:34:00.542
<i>Since the pandemic.</i>
<i>sites like this have exploded</i>

509
00:34:00.708 --> 00:34:02.917
<i>because people want</i>
<i>to create stuff for their customers.</i>

510
00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.125
Oh. Like. content?

511
00:34:06.417 --> 00:34:09.583
<i>Yeah. And guess</i>
<i>who designs your favorite ones.</i>

512
00:34:11.167 --> 00:34:12.167
You.

513
00:34:12.542 --> 00:34:13.542
<i>Humbly.</i>

514
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.083
<i>Goodnight. Bolanle.</i>

515
00:34:17.292 --> 00:34:19.292
Goodnight… friend.

516
00:34:31.875 --> 00:34:33.167
What am I doing?

517
00:35:26.917 --> 00:35:27.917
<i>How are you?</i>

518
00:35:29.167 --> 00:35:30.292
<i>I'm good. You?</i>

519
00:35:31.042 --> 00:35:32.167
So. what’s up?

520
00:35:32.542 --> 00:35:34.500
Nothing much. Just here.

521
00:35:34.583 --> 00:35:36.333
<i>Just by the pool side.</i>

522
00:35:36.542 --> 00:35:37.542
Hanging out.

523
00:35:37.625 --> 00:35:39.208
Bored of being inside.

524
00:35:40.708 --> 00:35:42.458
So. how is your boyfriend?

525
00:35:43.083 --> 00:35:44.083
Who? TJ?

526
00:35:44.292 --> 00:35:46.042
<i>I was not asking you about TJ.</i>

527
00:35:47.875 --> 00:35:48.958
Alex.

528
00:35:49.333 --> 00:35:51.750
Sis. How is he my boyfriend?

529
00:35:51.875 --> 00:35:53.375
I've never even met him before.

530
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:55.792
See you.

531
00:35:56.708 --> 00:35:57.708
I can imagine

532
00:35:57.792 --> 00:35:59.958
how you were blushing
when you mentioned his name.

533
00:36:00.042 --> 00:36:01.333
Alex.

534
00:36:03.792 --> 00:36:06.542
So. are you guys still talking?

535
00:36:08.208 --> 00:36:10.958
He talks to me all the time. Sis.

536
00:36:11.542 --> 00:36:16.042
<i>He keeps me company. talks to me</i>
<i>when I'm bored. encourages me.</i>

537
00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.458
Something that TJ never does.

538
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:21.042
You see?

539
00:36:21.125 --> 00:36:23.792
It means the universe
is trying to tell you something.

540
00:36:23.875 --> 00:36:27.417
that there are men
way better than that your TJ.

541
00:36:28.083 --> 00:36:31.208
All you need to do is
keep an open mind and listen.

542
00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.875
<i>Okay. Sis. Talk to you later.</i>

543
00:36:45.917 --> 00:36:46.917
<i>Hey.</i>

544
00:36:48.167 --> 00:36:52.042
Well. well. well. Look who decides
to pick my call today.

545
00:36:53.042 --> 00:36:56.208
C'mon. bae. Gimme a break.
It’s literally been hell here.

546
00:36:56.375 --> 00:36:58.208
Of course. Hell.

547
00:36:58.417 --> 00:37:02.875
<i>You know the cases in Lagos are worsening</i>
<i>by the minute and everything is exploding.</i>

548
00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:05.583
<i>Is that why you've been replied</i>
<i>to any of my text messages?</i>

549
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:09.167
Huh? So why did you pick up my call today?

550
00:37:09.792 --> 00:37:13.917
Huh? Oh. you miss my jollof rice
and my grilled chicken. right?

551
00:37:14.167 --> 00:37:15.958
Can you please give me a break?!

552
00:37:16.125 --> 00:37:18.458
This is real life.
People are dying. literally!

553
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.208
So am I!

554
00:37:20.292 --> 00:37:23.000
I’m a real person too. aren’t I?

555
00:37:23.083 --> 00:37:24.167
<i>You know what?</i>

556
00:37:24.333 --> 00:37:26.375
<i>When you're ready to talk. how about</i>

557
00:37:26.458 --> 00:37:28.208
you call me. I don't have time for this.

558
00:37:29.583 --> 00:37:31.375
TJ. don't--

559
00:39:00.042 --> 00:39:02.000
Wait. babe. Aren’t you supposed
to go to the hospital?

560
00:39:03.458 --> 00:39:06.458
Uh. no babe. I'm still on leave.

561
00:39:07.375 --> 00:39:12.333
Oh. oh okay. I thought they would've
needed at least more health workers.

562
00:39:12.625 --> 00:39:16.875
Well. I'm not going to risk my life for
a disease that nobody knows the cure to.

563
00:39:17.708 --> 00:39:18.958
-Right.
-Besides.

564
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:20.958
I like spending all my free time with you.

565
00:39:21.125 --> 00:39:24.292
Aww. you just know
the perfect things to say.

566
00:39:26.333 --> 00:39:28.292
-Hold on. babes.
-Mmh!

567
00:39:28.583 --> 00:39:29.917
-Are you okay?
-Mm-mm.

568
00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.958
-What's the problem?
-Baby. I want some jollof rice.

569
00:39:32.083 --> 00:39:34.667
-Well. I'll order jollof rice for you.
-No. I'm hungry.

570
00:39:34.792 --> 00:39:37.417
Babe. I'm playing
this video game. hold on.

571
00:39:37.583 --> 00:39:40.333
Wait. You're picking a game over me?

572
00:39:41.083 --> 00:39:42.625
-Okay. I got--
-Babe!

573
00:39:42.792 --> 00:39:45.167
-I got you. I'll order jollof rice. okay?
-You're gonna do it now?

574
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.458
-Sure.
-Babe. focus.

575
00:39:47.667 --> 00:39:50.375
-I'm fo… I'm focused.
-Are you picking the game over me?

576
00:39:53.250 --> 00:39:54.292
You're so cute.

577
00:39:54.417 --> 00:39:56.708
-Okay.
-Okay. No game. Go.

578
00:39:57.708 --> 00:39:59.250
Sure. Lemme go get it.

579
00:39:59.417 --> 00:40:01.958
-Thanks babe.
-You're welcome.

580
00:40:28.042 --> 00:40:29.583
Good afternoon.

581
00:40:46.083 --> 00:40:47.208
-Sister.
-Hmm?

582
00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.750
It's like you have not come out since
the day you closed from work. right?

583
00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.083
No.
I've not been out in a long time.

584
00:40:54.250 --> 00:40:58.125
Right. It's not easy.
That's the situation with everybody.

585
00:40:58.542 --> 00:41:00.375
You've been working?

586
00:41:00.583 --> 00:41:03.750
I have.
But business has been slow.

587
00:41:04.833 --> 00:41:06.792
I've not been getting too many rides.

588
00:41:07.292 --> 00:41:08.792
And the police.

589
00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:11.000
they disturb us too much!

590
00:41:11.292 --> 00:41:12.292
Hmm.

591
00:41:12.583 --> 00:41:14.458
All because
of this so-called curfew.

592
00:41:15.625 --> 00:41:18.292
As if corona only comes out at night.

593
00:41:18.583 --> 00:41:19.750
Hmm.

594
00:41:20.917 --> 00:41:23.042
-Valid point.
-They don't have work to do.

595
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:29.375
Sister. I can't take it
anymore. I have to confess.

596
00:41:29.667 --> 00:41:30.667
What’s that?

597
00:41:30.875 --> 00:41:34.208
I just can't take it
anymore. This your food.

598
00:41:34.542 --> 00:41:38.042
the scent is strong.
Your man will enjoy it.

599
00:41:38.333 --> 00:41:40.125
Hey. Hmm.

600
00:41:41.208 --> 00:41:42.500
Or didn't you cook it?

601
00:41:42.667 --> 00:41:44.417
I cooked it. Thank you.

602
00:41:45.792 --> 00:41:48.875
How do you know it's for a man?

603
00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:50.583
Please keep an eye on the road.

604
00:41:51.083 --> 00:41:52.958
Don't get an accident
because of jollof rice.

605
00:42:05.042 --> 00:42:06.958
Hello. Nurse. Good afternoon.

606
00:42:07.333 --> 00:42:09.583
-Nurse Mira. I--
-Ah. Doc-Doc!

607
00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:11.500
Bolanle! Ha! Long time!

608
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:14.292
-How are you now?
-I'm very well.

609
00:42:14.917 --> 00:42:17.750
How's it going?
Ah. sorry I can't shake you…

610
00:42:17.917 --> 00:42:19.292
-or greet you properly.
-I understand.

611
00:42:19.458 --> 00:42:21.125
-You've been working. you know.
-Yeah.

612
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:24.500
Um. how did they
even let you into these premises?

613
00:42:25.458 --> 00:42:27.167
Well. I used my charms.

614
00:42:27.542 --> 00:42:29.750
Hmm. You are looking so fine.

615
00:42:29.833 --> 00:42:30.875
Thank you.

616
00:42:31.208 --> 00:42:32.875
And. by the way. what are you doing here?

617
00:42:33.542 --> 00:42:37.125
Uh. I'm here to see TJ.

618
00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.417
-TJ?
-Mm-hmm.

619
00:42:41.333 --> 00:42:42.792
What? Isn’t he here?

620
00:42:44.292 --> 00:42:46.000
TJ is not here. Bolanle.

621
00:42:47.667 --> 00:42:49.667
Why? What?!

622
00:42:51.750 --> 00:42:54.125
Tejiri has not come to work
since the lockdown started.

623
00:42:57.167 --> 00:43:01.042
He. um… Is there a problem?

624
00:43:03.125 --> 00:43:04.458
He was suspended.

625
00:43:07.417 --> 00:43:13.708
Suspended. What… what happened?
Wh… when did this happen?

626
00:43:14.875 --> 00:43:16.208
He'll discuss that with you.

627
00:43:17.083 --> 00:43:19.042
I’m really disappointed
he didn’t tell you.

628
00:43:23.917 --> 00:43:25.625
Right.

629
00:43:27.083 --> 00:43:28.542
Right.

630
00:43:29.833 --> 00:43:31.042
I guess I'll just go…

631
00:43:31.208 --> 00:43:32.375
-check for him at home.
-Yes.

632
00:43:32.542 --> 00:43:33.875
That’s where you will find him.

633
00:43:35.792 --> 00:43:37.375
-Thank you. Doc.
-You're welcome.

634
00:43:40.458 --> 00:43:44.333
Nurse Mira. I'll need you to change
the drips in Ward Eight. Hmm?

635
00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.708
-Okay. Doctor.
-Now.

636
00:44:03.458 --> 00:44:07.292
Just hold on please. Mr. Sunday.
Let me check if he's home. Hmm?

637
00:44:07.458 --> 00:44:08.458
Okay.

638
00:44:21.750 --> 00:44:22.833
Hello.

639
00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.667
Oh! Oh. the food.

640
00:44:27.833 --> 00:44:31.792
Thank you. Thank you so much
for coming so quickly.

641
00:44:32.125 --> 00:44:35.250
Your jollof rice. the best. My favorite.

642
00:44:35.708 --> 00:44:37.000
Babe!

643
00:44:38.167 --> 00:44:39.875
Babe. the food is here!

644
00:44:40.833 --> 00:44:41.833
How much?

645
00:44:45.333 --> 00:44:46.458
Is there a problem?

646
00:44:49.917 --> 00:44:51.833
Uh just. give me a minute.

647
00:44:56.583 --> 00:44:59.292
I know what you'd like. A tip.

648
00:44:59.750 --> 00:45:02.167
Because you have the best jollof rice.

649
00:45:02.667 --> 00:45:03.667
Okay.

650
00:45:03.792 --> 00:45:05.875
Hey. baby. I didn't hear you
properly. What's up?

651
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:07.458
-What's going on?
-The food.

652
00:45:08.250 --> 00:45:10.500
Uh. this should do.

653
00:45:12.958 --> 00:45:14.292
Have. have you paid?

654
00:45:14.708 --> 00:45:15.917
Uh. yeah.

655
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:17.958
Oh. okay. Bye.

656
00:45:18.792 --> 00:45:20.042
I didn't know you already paid.

657
00:46:11.875 --> 00:46:13.958
Me. cook...

658
00:47:42.167 --> 00:47:44.042
<i>God will punish that TJ!</i>

659
00:47:44.292 --> 00:47:46.917
For using and playing with you
without any respect or remorse.

660
00:47:47.208 --> 00:47:48.208
Ah-ah!

661
00:47:48.292 --> 00:47:49.667
<i>Why are men like that?</i>

662
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.083
<i>See Bolanle. you should come live with us.</i>

663
00:47:53.958 --> 00:47:54.958
I should?

664
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:56.250
Yes of course.

665
00:47:56.542 --> 00:48:00.375
Please come. The house is honestly
too big for Marcus and I to live in.

666
00:48:01.625 --> 00:48:03.250
<i>I think you should just come.</i>

667
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:08.583
<i>So. does he know that</i>
<i>your first relationship is over?</i>

668
00:48:09.958 --> 00:48:10.958
Who?

669
00:48:11.958 --> 00:48:12.958
Alex.

670
00:48:13.333 --> 00:48:14.542
<i>How's that important?</i>

671
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:17.167
Sweetheart.

672
00:48:18.333 --> 00:48:20.583
<i>Anyone will be blessed</i>
<i>to have you in their life.</i>

673
00:48:21.625 --> 00:48:23.667
<i>I don't need to state the obvious.</i>

674
00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:28.542
But um. a broken heart
sure needs some mending.

675
00:48:30.125 --> 00:48:32.500
You're my sister.
You're expected to say that.

676
00:48:32.917 --> 00:48:35.750
<i>And I can also slap some sense</i>
<i>into you if you're not listening.</i>

677
00:48:38.958 --> 00:48:42.208
I'll think about it. Sis. Okay? Bye.

678
00:48:49.417 --> 00:48:50.917
What a bummer!

679
00:48:51.625 --> 00:48:55.042
I… I don't even know what to say.

680
00:48:55.875 --> 00:48:57.167
This is so disappointing.

681
00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:58.542
I know. right.

682
00:48:59.833 --> 00:49:01.083
<i>Gosh.</i>

683
00:49:01.167 --> 00:49:03.167
some men can be so wicked.

684
00:49:04.708 --> 00:49:06.417
You mean you were cooking for him

685
00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:07.750
and his side chick?

686
00:49:07.833 --> 00:49:09.333
Who said that's the side chick?

687
00:49:10.292 --> 00:49:11.458
My God.

688
00:49:12.833 --> 00:49:15.042
To think you were actually
trying to work things out with him.

689
00:49:19.042 --> 00:49:20.125
<i>I wish I could just…</i>

690
00:49:21.667 --> 00:49:25.500
you know. just give you
a hug or something.

691
00:49:26.583 --> 00:49:28.000
<i>I'm so sorry. Bolanle.</i>

692
00:49:32.042 --> 00:49:33.292
So. what are you going to do now?

693
00:49:34.375 --> 00:49:38.750
Do? Obviously I'm done
with that lying and cheating bastard.

694
00:49:39.750 --> 00:49:41.417
<i>I'm just gonna focus on myself.</i>

695
00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.208
my work and whatever else I find.

696
00:49:45.042 --> 00:49:47.167
Okay.

697
00:49:48.083 --> 00:49:49.625
But please if there’s anything.

698
00:49:50.625 --> 00:49:52.542
anything at all I can do
to make you feel better…

699
00:49:54.083 --> 00:49:55.292
<i>just let me know.</i>

700
00:49:55.708 --> 00:49:56.750
I will.

701
00:49:57.208 --> 00:49:58.208
Thanks.

702
00:49:58.958 --> 00:50:00.208
I have to go now.

703
00:50:00.917 --> 00:50:02.417
Oh. Okay.

704
00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Bye.

705
00:50:04.333 --> 00:50:05.333
Bye.

706
00:50:19.417 --> 00:50:20.625
Making new friends?

707
00:50:22.833 --> 00:50:24.333
It's none of your business.

708
00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:30.167
You know. you don’t have to pretend

709
00:50:30.292 --> 00:50:33.167
that there’s someone else
just to scare me off.

710
00:50:41.375 --> 00:50:42.458
So…

711
00:50:46.458 --> 00:50:47.625
is there someone else?

712
00:50:48.792 --> 00:50:50.125
-Uduak…
-Mm-hmm?

713
00:50:50.625 --> 00:50:54.417
You and I are no longer together.
It really is none of your business.

714
00:50:54.583 --> 00:50:55.792
But I want you.

715
00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:04.708
-You’ve missed this.
-What are you doing?

716
00:51:04.792 --> 00:51:07.958
Hmm. You know exactly what I'm doing.

717
00:51:09.667 --> 00:51:11.125
Uduak.

718
00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:33.625
-Get out!
-Babe. wait.

719
00:51:33.708 --> 00:51:35.000
-Get out!
-I promise you I can explain.

720
00:51:35.083 --> 00:51:36.625
-Get out!
-Wait. wait.

721
00:51:36.708 --> 00:51:37.792
-Get out!
-Babe. listen. listen--

722
00:51:38.333 --> 00:51:40.500
-Who's this? Who's this?
-Babe. babe. I can explain.

723
00:51:40.583 --> 00:51:42.042
-No.
-I can explain that note I promise!

724
00:51:42.208 --> 00:51:43.208
Get out!

725
00:51:43.333 --> 00:51:44.958
-Babe. no. no. no!
-I said. get out!

726
00:51:45.083 --> 00:51:46.667
-Wait. wait!
-Out!

727
00:51:46.958 --> 00:51:48.083
-Out! Out! Out!
-Wait.

728
00:51:48.208 --> 00:51:49.917
Can I… can I explain at least. Please!

729
00:51:50.042 --> 00:51:51.042
-Get…
-Please!

730
00:51:51.125 --> 00:51:53.500
Please. baby. no. no! Please.

731
00:51:53.792 --> 00:51:54.792
-Get out!
-Sorry.

732
00:51:55.625 --> 00:51:57.292
-Get out!
-Please.

733
00:51:57.417 --> 00:51:59.083
-Please. one more just--
-Get…

734
00:51:59.708 --> 00:52:01.625
Get out!

735
00:52:13.458 --> 00:52:15.583
Madam. someone sent that to you.

736
00:52:15.875 --> 00:52:17.250
Oh.

737
00:52:21.292 --> 00:52:23.917
This is so--

738
00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.333
What the heck is
this one coming to do here?

739
00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:41.500
Hey!

740
00:52:42.417 --> 00:52:43.583
What are you doing here?

741
00:52:45.375 --> 00:52:46.417
I just came to talk.

742
00:52:46.583 --> 00:52:49.208
Talk about what?
There's nothing to talk about. Get out.

743
00:52:49.625 --> 00:52:51.708
Don't you think
you're overreacting. Small.

744
00:52:51.958 --> 00:52:55.542
Over… are you fucking
kidding me right now?

745
00:52:56.375 --> 00:52:57.375
Calm down.

746
00:52:57.625 --> 00:52:58.750
Overreacting?!

747
00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:01.458
You were cheating the entire relationship

748
00:53:01.667 --> 00:53:03.333
and you're here
to tell me I've been overreacting?

749
00:53:03.542 --> 00:53:04.583
Really?

750
00:53:04.875 --> 00:53:07.250
I don't think you need an
announcement to know it's over

751
00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:09.292
between the both of us.
Get out of my compound.

752
00:53:09.417 --> 00:53:12.333
You throw away our meal ticket. over what?

753
00:53:12.458 --> 00:53:15.542
A few unanswered calls.
Are you serious? How much do doctors make?

754
00:53:15.708 --> 00:53:17.167
Are you gaslighting me right now?

755
00:53:18.292 --> 00:53:22.792
Listen. Bolanle.
I can take you back. We can start over.

756
00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.333
I'll forgive you.
I promise. We can move on.

757
00:53:25.875 --> 00:53:27.125
Start from scratch.

758
00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:29.625
You will for…

759
00:53:32.833 --> 00:53:33.917
Get out of this house.

760
00:53:34.292 --> 00:53:35.834
I regret the day I ever set my eyes on you

761
00:53:35.917 --> 00:53:38.000
Get out of my house right now!

762
00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:42.417
Get out of this… I swear to God. if
you don't leave this premises right now.

763
00:53:42.667 --> 00:53:44.625
you will regret ever driving
into this compound.

764
00:53:45.292 --> 00:53:46.958
Get out. I'm warning you now.

765
00:53:49.375 --> 00:53:51.625
How long did it take you
to find a new boyfriend?

766
00:53:51.917 --> 00:53:54.667
Hmm? It wasn't even up to a minute.

767
00:53:55.083 --> 00:53:57.333
Someone is already sending you a gift.

768
00:53:57.833 --> 00:54:02.083
-A basket. a box. whatever this is.
-TJ. get out! Get… get out of my house.

769
00:54:02.208 --> 00:54:03.292
Or what?

770
00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:05.917
No problem. just wait.

771
00:54:09.667 --> 00:54:10.708
-Shit!
-Out!

772
00:54:10.833 --> 00:54:13.458
-What! Stop. no. no. no. Please!
-Get out! Get out!

773
00:54:14.542 --> 00:54:15.542
Get out!

774
00:54:15.708 --> 00:54:17.958
-I'll go. I'll go! I'll go! Just…
-Get out!

775
00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:22.000
Why. why? What kind of women are…

776
00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.542
Oh God.

777
00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:30.250
Hey!

778
00:54:32.833 --> 00:54:37.042
<i>Hello. my dear.</i>
<i>Er. I don’t understand this thing.</i>

779
00:54:37.583 --> 00:54:38.958
Could you please be clear. ma'am.

780
00:54:39.125 --> 00:54:41.375
Uh. this thing…

781
00:54:41.667 --> 00:54:46.625
It doesn't look like a pot and
it's not even shaped like a pot.

782
00:54:47.625 --> 00:54:49.375
What's written on the box it came in?

783
00:54:49.583 --> 00:54:51.083
I don't know.

784
00:54:52.958 --> 00:54:54.083
<i>Don’t you have it there?</i>

785
00:54:54.917 --> 00:54:57.000
It's there.

786
00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.250
<i>Or can't you read?</i>

787
00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Ah-ah.

788
00:55:04.375 --> 00:55:05.792
Is there a cable in the box?

789
00:55:06.375 --> 00:55:07.375
<i>No.</i>

790
00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:10.208
Madam. please check again.

791
00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:17.083
Okay. I think… Alright. I've seen it.

792
00:55:17.375 --> 00:55:21.083
<i>But how do I use this box to cook. hmm?</i>

793
00:55:21.625 --> 00:55:25.833
And I even think it er.
it. it came with a sieve.

794
00:55:26.833 --> 00:55:31.208
What you bought is a deep fryer not a pot.

795
00:55:32.042 --> 00:55:33.583
For goodness sakes!

796
00:55:33.792 --> 00:55:38.292
<i>Okay! A deep fryer.</i>
<i>So. how do I use this deep fryer?</i>

797
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:40.167
Are you kidding me right now?

798
00:55:41.083 --> 00:55:43.208
You bought something
that you don't know how to use.

799
00:55:43.375 --> 00:55:44.542
and you want to make it a random

800
00:55:44.625 --> 00:55:46.083
<i>person's problem?</i>

801
00:55:46.167 --> 00:55:48.375
<i>A random customer care person's problem?</i>

802
00:55:48.833 --> 00:55:50.167
What is wrong with you people?

803
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:52.333
Don't you look at things
before you buy them?

804
00:55:53.125 --> 00:55:57.958
<i>Er. it's one of our women leader that was</i>
talking about it when I went to visit her.

805
00:55:58.500 --> 00:55:59.958
So I decided to buy too.

806
00:56:01.083 --> 00:56:03.625
<i>Oh. so you're dumb. Hmm?</i>

807
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.250
<i>Now you're competing</i>
<i>with your women's leader'.</i>

808
00:56:06.417 --> 00:56:08.792
She bought something that
she knows. you. you followed. carry.

809
00:56:09.042 --> 00:56:11.625
bought something that you don't know
and you want to make it my problem?

810
00:56:11.917 --> 00:56:14.083
-Huh?
-Excuse me!

811
00:56:14.625 --> 00:56:16.083
Do you know that is an insult?

812
00:56:16.667 --> 00:56:21.500
Really? So. this is how you talk
to your mother at home. Huh?

813
00:56:22.667 --> 00:56:24.583
No. because my mother is not dumb.

814
00:56:24.875 --> 00:56:25.875
You are.

815
00:56:25.958 --> 00:56:28.167
<i>You're insulting me cause of deep fryer?</i>

816
00:56:28.250 --> 00:56:29.333
Yes.

817
00:56:30.208 --> 00:56:33.042
If you don't like
getting insults. do better.

818
00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:44.042
I’m definitely fired.

819
00:56:58.458 --> 00:57:00.917
<i>Bolanle. are you okay?</i>

820
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:02.750
Yes. I am.

821
00:57:03.375 --> 00:57:07.292
<i>I don’t think so. Because if you are.</i>
<i>you won't insult a caller.</i>

822
00:57:08.792 --> 00:57:09.833
You heard that?

823
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.875
<i>Of course I did. Q.A sent it to me.</i>

824
00:57:13.458 --> 00:57:15.542
<i>What's wrong with you? You of all people?</i>

825
00:57:17.583 --> 00:57:21.792
I'm sorry. sir. I just… snapped.

826
00:57:22.417 --> 00:57:24.167
<i>You were trained. self control…</i>

827
00:57:24.417 --> 00:57:26.542
Yes. sir. Sorry.

828
00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.292
<i>You’ve gone from being</i>
<i>a top performer to the least.</i>

829
00:57:30.542 --> 00:57:33.417
<i>If you needed to take time off.</i>
<i>you should have just asked.</i>

830
00:57:34.542 --> 00:57:36.167
<i>I don’t know what's going on with you.</i>

831
00:57:36.750 --> 00:57:38.750
<i>but your sanity is very important to me.</i>

832
00:57:40.917 --> 00:57:42.375
I want to resign. sir.

833
00:57:43.292 --> 00:57:44.292
<i>What?!</i>

834
00:57:46.083 --> 00:57:47.417
<i>What did you just say?</i>

835
00:57:48.083 --> 00:57:50.333
I said I want to resign. sir.

836
00:57:50.625 --> 00:57:53.250
<i>Bolanle. have you thought this through?</i>

837
00:57:53.708 --> 00:57:56.667
-<i>Thoroughly?</i>
-For a very long time. yes.

838
00:57:56.958 --> 00:57:58.000
<i>Are you sure?</i>

839
00:58:03.167 --> 00:58:05.500
Why do you work at JJ Logistics. sir?

840
00:58:08.833 --> 00:58:11.375
<i>Some of us don’t have the luxury</i>
<i>of living our dreams.</i>

841
00:58:11.833 --> 00:58:15.667
<i>so we just do whatever puts food</i>
<i>on the table and pays the bills.</i>

842
00:58:16.542 --> 00:58:17.708
<i>And that’s okay for me.</i>

843
00:58:18.458 --> 00:58:20.625
But there has to be more for me out there.

844
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:23.792
<i>Are you sure?</i>

845
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.250
Yes.

846
00:58:29.792 --> 00:58:32.417
I can't be a customer care rep
for the rest of my life.

847
00:58:33.875 --> 00:58:36.667
<i>Okay. Send in your resignation.</i>

848
00:58:39.625 --> 00:58:40.625
Yes sir.

849
00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:44.667
<i>Thank you. We’ll send a car</i>
<i>to pick up your work tools.</i>

850
00:58:47.250 --> 00:58:48.375
Thank you. sir.

851
00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:06.708
<i>So. how do you feel?</i>

852
00:59:07.125 --> 00:59:08.833
I've never felt better.

853
00:59:09.083 --> 00:59:11.625
I feel like a huge burden
has been taken off my shoulders.

854
00:59:12.125 --> 00:59:14.208
I never liked talking
to those people anyway.

855
00:59:15.042 --> 00:59:18.500
Now that that's over. I can finally
focus on this Ultimate Chef Show.

856
00:59:18.958 --> 00:59:22.750
And maybe start a new career
that I actually. actually love.

857
00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.708
Well. you already have what it takes
to be the Number One chef in this state.

858
00:59:27.875 --> 00:59:29.917
What's stopping you
from starting your own food business?

859
00:59:30.458 --> 00:59:31.542
Hmm?

860
00:59:32.708 --> 00:59:33.917
You know what?

861
00:59:34.750 --> 00:59:37.167
-What would you call your brand?
-Hmm…

862
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:39.917
I have never thought about that.

863
00:59:41.500 --> 00:59:42.792
How about…

864
00:59:44.167 --> 00:59:45.500
"Bolanle's

865
00:59:47.167 --> 00:59:49.375
Bitters"?
<i>-Bitters?</i>

866
00:59:49.792 --> 00:59:51.875
Why "Bitters"?

867
00:59:52.333 --> 00:59:55.250
No. no. hold on. How about uh.

868
00:59:57.125 --> 01:00:03.750
"Bolanle's Bites." No. no.
"Bites by Bolanle". BBB. Triple B! Huh?

869
01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:08.708
I like that. Actually. Triple B.

870
01:00:09.042 --> 01:00:10.042
<i>Yea!</i>

871
01:00:10.542 --> 01:00:11.542
Triple B.

872
01:00:11.708 --> 01:00:14.042
I told you I'm the man.

873
01:00:15.333 --> 01:00:17.792
But I don’t know anything
about branding on social media.

874
01:00:18.083 --> 01:00:21.458
Uh. but you know everything
about making the most delicious food.

875
01:00:21.625 --> 01:00:23.167
Which you've never tasted.

876
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.208
You worry about the cooking.

877
01:00:27.625 --> 01:00:29.875
I'll worry about
the brand and business plan. alright?

878
01:00:30.375 --> 01:00:32.500
-I can’t pay you. Alex.
-Hmm.

879
01:00:34.625 --> 01:00:35.917
You don’t have to pay me. Bolanle.

880
01:00:36.583 --> 01:00:38.125
Just start this business already.

881
01:00:38.958 --> 01:00:40.000
Okay.

882
01:01:53.208 --> 01:01:54.292
Hi. guys!

883
01:01:54.542 --> 01:01:56.292
Aw. you guys. Thank you so very much

Our page is booming. Talk about growth.

886
01:02:02.208 --> 01:02:04.792
Anyways. in light of that
I want to tell you that I have

887
01:02:05.042 --> 01:02:06.792

888
01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:09.458
<i>but guess what?</i>
<i>I will only be selling 40 packs.</i>

889
01:02:09.542 --> 01:02:12.167

<i>to be giving out ten to you guys</i>

01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:32.083
Delivery is absolutely free.
I know! Exciting. right?

895
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.875
I can't wait to see

896
01:02:35.167 --> 01:02:38.208
Thank you so much for the love. Mwah. bye!

897
01:02:41.083 --> 01:02:44.917
Sis. so sorry. It's something
I have to do every time for my page.

898
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
-Hmm.
-You know. that's the only way it grows.

899
01:02:47.208 --> 01:02:48.583
-I know. I understand.
-When I was

900
01:02:48.833 --> 01:02:51.000
doing the video. I saw an email.
Just gimme a minute. Lemme just…

901
01:02:51.125 --> 01:02:52.125
-quickly…
-Okay.

902
01:02:52.292 --> 01:02:53.792
check what that is.

903
01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:55.750
Ultimate Chef Show.

904
01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.500
“Dear Bolanle.

905
01:03:00.750 --> 01:03:04.167
based on your remarkable
culinary content and style.

906
01:03:04.667 --> 01:03:06.708
we are pleased to inform
you that you have been

907
01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:11.542
selected as our wild card entry for the
lockdown edition of Ultimate Chef Show.

908
01:03:12.208 --> 01:03:13.833
''May the spices be in your favor...”

909
01:03:17.042 --> 01:03:18.625
-Can you believe that?
-I know.

910
01:03:18.833 --> 01:03:20.500
Where did this come from?

911
01:03:20.917 --> 01:03:23.292
-Oh wow.
-Oh my God. Sis!

912
01:03:23.917 --> 01:03:25.667
-Can you imagine?
-I know.

913
01:03:25.750 --> 01:03:26.750
Who even did…

914
01:03:32.208 --> 01:03:34.167
Somebody doesn't seem happy for me.

915
01:03:35.167 --> 01:03:39.125
-No. of course. I am. I'm happy.
-Aby. I know you. This is not happy.

916
01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.250
Okay. so…

917
01:03:43.542 --> 01:03:46.500
Well. I was… I was kinda
expecting something else.

918
01:03:47.292 --> 01:03:49.042
Like what?

919
01:03:50.042 --> 01:03:55.042
Okay. can you imagine talking
to a straight. single young man

920
01:03:55.333 --> 01:03:57.958
from the start of the pandemic.

921
01:03:58.458 --> 01:04:01.208
And then you're losing out
on him. all because you refuse

922
01:04:01.625 --> 01:04:03.583
to let him know
you're having feelings for him.

923
01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
When the guy himself
has feelings for you too.

924
01:04:06.333 --> 01:04:08.583
Nobody is catching
feelings for anybody here.

925
01:04:10.042 --> 01:04:11.042
That's a lie.

926
01:04:12.042 --> 01:04:13.333
Bolanle.

927
01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:16.708
You're lying and you know.

928
01:04:17.708 --> 01:04:19.208
I know you have feelings for that guy.

929
01:04:25.167 --> 01:04:27.208
He’s in Asaba. I’m in Lagos.

930
01:04:27.375 --> 01:04:31.125
I was in Cape Town when I started
talking to my husband. Marcus.

931
01:04:31.333 --> 01:04:33.417
And now I’m having his babies.

932
01:04:33.792 --> 01:04:35.833
Who says I want a love like yours.

933
01:04:36.125 --> 01:04:37.875
Are you mad? Ah-ah!

934
01:04:39.458 --> 01:04:42.458
I don't want it. I don't do long distance.

935
01:04:42.667 --> 01:04:45.583
Bolanle. see. I mean. call this guy.

936
01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:47.583
Tell him exactly how you feel.

937
01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:49.458
I mean. and let the universe take over.

938
01:04:49.833 --> 01:04:51.292
It doesn't hurt to do that now.

939
01:04:51.958 --> 01:04:53.375
Does it hurt?

940
01:04:54.083 --> 01:04:55.083
Okay I will.

941
01:04:55.375 --> 01:04:57.417
-When?
-When?

942
01:04:57.625 --> 01:04:59.250
Yes. Tell him now.

943
01:05:00.542 --> 01:05:01.542
-Sis.
-Mm-hmm.

944
01:05:01.667 --> 01:05:03.083
-Don't do this.
-Yes. you're doing it.

945
01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:04.333
You're gonna put me in trouble.

946
01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:06.375
Now. Call him.

947
01:05:17.667 --> 01:05:18.667
Hey.

948
01:05:18.875 --> 01:05:20.917
<i>Ultimate Chef Show? Really?</i>

949
01:05:21.458 --> 01:05:26.583
<i>Mm-hmm! Listen. someone there owes me</i>

950
01:05:26.708 --> 01:05:28.750
<i>a favor and the only thing I could ask for</i>

951
01:05:29.292 --> 01:05:31.958
<i>was that they put you</i>
<i>on the show. Too much?</i>

952
01:05:33.083 --> 01:05:35.458
<i>But if you're not interested.</i>
<i>I could always…</i>

953
01:05:35.625 --> 01:05:38.542
<i>No. Of course. I want it. I want to cook</i>

954
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:42.125
<i>but… Alex. this is so big!</i>

955
01:05:43.083 --> 01:05:45.292
You can always
politely decline the invitation.

956
01:05:46.667 --> 01:05:48.917
Alex. relax okay?

957
01:05:49.542 --> 01:05:51.042
<i>Calm down.</i>

958
01:05:56.708 --> 01:05:59.667
Alex. I just wanted
to say thank you for everything.

959
01:06:01.417 --> 01:06:04.833
<i>Everything you’ve done for me</i>
<i>since the beginning of lockdown</i>

960
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:09.042
<i>up until now. You've just been amazing.</i>

961
01:06:10.417 --> 01:06:12.958
<i>You've believed in me even more than…</i>

962
01:06:14.333 --> 01:06:16.208
<i>more than I could ever believe in myself.</i>

963
01:06:18.167 --> 01:06:19.375
<i>And the best part.</i>

964
01:06:20.458 --> 01:06:23.625
<i>you've never asked for anything in return.</i>

965
01:06:24.375 --> 01:06:25.917
I just want you to be happy. Bolanle.

966
01:06:27.208 --> 01:06:28.417
That’s what I want in return.

967
01:06:28.792 --> 01:06:30.250
Aww.

968
01:06:34.625 --> 01:06:36.292
-Alex?
-<i>Huh?</i>

969
01:06:36.542 --> 01:06:37.917
Do you like ice cream?

970
01:06:39.542 --> 01:06:40.667
<i>You know I do.</i>

971
01:06:41.667 --> 01:06:42.667
Okay.

972
01:06:43.458 --> 01:06:46.625
I was wondering if I could take
you out to have some ice cream.

973
01:06:47.292 --> 01:06:48.750
when the lockdown is over?

974
01:06:55.958 --> 01:06:57.500
Because I like you.

975
01:06:58.708 --> 01:06:59.875
And I'd love to…

976
01:07:00.792 --> 01:07:01.875
<i>to go out with you.</i>

977
01:07:03.042 --> 01:07:06.083
Breakfast is served!

978
01:07:06.417 --> 01:07:07.417
Um…

979
01:07:09.958 --> 01:07:12.208
Ah-ah. Alex.

980
01:07:14.708 --> 01:07:15.833
Who's your friend?

981
01:07:20.333 --> 01:07:22.292
<i>Bolanle. meet Uduak.</i>

982
01:07:23.125 --> 01:07:24.125
<i>Bolanle…</i>

983
01:07:29.375 --> 01:07:32.542
<i>Aww. Why are you crying?</i>

984
01:07:34.042 --> 01:07:35.542
<i>Alex. why is she crying?</i>

985
01:07:35.708 --> 01:07:38.917
<i>Uduak. can you please</i>
<i>give us some privacy.</i>

986
01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:44.000
Is she one of your bitches?

987
01:07:44.542 --> 01:07:48.042
Hey.

988
01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.083
Are you okay?

989
01:07:59.125 --> 01:08:00.125
Bolanle?

990
01:08:00.625 --> 01:08:02.458
Did you hear her. Sis?

991
01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:07.167
She said “breakfast is served.”

992
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.333
-She's talking about me. Sis.
-No way.

993
01:08:12.542 --> 01:08:14.542
I've been served breakfast.

994
01:08:18.667 --> 01:08:20.292
Look at you!

995
01:08:20.792 --> 01:08:24.000
You know I never would have thought
that you'd be able to fall in love again.

996
01:08:24.582 --> 01:08:28.250
Since you said that I shattered
your heart into a thousand pieces.

997
01:08:28.667 --> 01:08:30.000
Hmm?

998
01:08:33.875 --> 01:08:35.082
-Uduak.
-Hmm?

999
01:08:35.417 --> 01:08:36.957
I think it's time
for you to leave my house.

1000
01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.167
-You're joking.
-No.

1001
01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.125
I'm done.

1002
01:08:42.207 --> 01:08:45.832
You know. that's the same thing you said
when you chickened out of our wedding.

1003
01:08:45.917 --> 01:08:48.417
That was because
you lied about your genotype!

1004
01:08:49.332 --> 01:08:52.875
But that didn't stop you from sleeping
with me every time you felt horny.

1005
01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.042
You…

1006
01:08:55.207 --> 01:08:56.667
you're not going to ruin my life.

1007
01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.042
-any more than you already have.
-Alex. come on.

1008
01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:00.417
Uduak!

1009
01:09:01.042 --> 01:09:04.000
Pack your shit and
get the fuck out of my house.

1010
01:09:04.542 --> 01:09:05.667
I'm done with your bullshit.

1011
01:09:13.125 --> 01:09:14.582
I'm… I'm not going anywhere.

1012
01:09:17.207 --> 01:09:18.417
I'm not going anywhere.

1013
01:09:21.250 --> 01:09:22.667
Is that all you're going to say?

1014
01:09:23.957 --> 01:09:25.125
That's it.

1015
01:09:26.625 --> 01:09:27.875
He’s not the one for me.

1016
01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:30.082
It's okay.

1017
01:09:32.457 --> 01:09:33.707
I'll find the one for me.

1018
01:09:34.582 --> 01:09:35.707
He's just not the one.

1019
01:09:37.582 --> 01:09:40.250
I'm just thankful for
the whole experience. It's been great.

1020
01:09:42.832 --> 01:09:43.875
It was great.

1021
01:09:44.582 --> 01:09:45.582
I'm sorry.

1022
01:09:46.957 --> 01:09:48.250
It's okay. Sis.

1023
01:09:49.167 --> 01:09:50.625
I'm so sorry.

1024
01:09:50.875 --> 01:09:52.625
It's okay. Sis.

1025
01:09:53.625 --> 01:09:55.333
I'm sorry.

1026
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.542
-I'm okay. No stress. please.
-I'm sorry.

1027
01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:03.542
Why are you wet?

1028
01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.500
Oh!

1029
01:10:07.417 --> 01:10:10.750
Sorry. sorry. sorry.

1030
01:10:11.083 --> 01:10:14.333
-Ah! My waist.
-Sorry.

1031
01:10:16.708 --> 01:10:19.208
-I want to pee.
-Sorry. sorry. sorry. sorry.

1032
01:10:19.375 --> 01:10:25.167
Hold on. Sorry. sorry.

1033
01:10:25.792 --> 01:10:27.875
Okay. Yes. Okay.

1034
01:10:28.417 --> 01:10:30.958
Thank you.

1035
01:13:22.125 --> 01:13:23.500
Hey. Aisha.

1036
01:13:25.833 --> 01:13:26.875
I need a favour.

1037
01:13:52.917 --> 01:13:54.500
You're really not going to say hello?

1038
01:13:59.167 --> 01:14:00.500
What do you want?

1039
01:14:02.417 --> 01:14:03.542
Where are you off to?

1040
01:14:09.500 --> 01:14:10.917
You can't be serious.

1041
01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.458
You're really chasing after that bitch?

1042
01:14:13.708 --> 01:14:16.333
-Don't call her that.
-I will call her whatever I like.

1043
01:14:20.125 --> 01:14:21.250
Go home. Uduak.

1044
01:14:26.417 --> 01:14:30.750
Look. she will never
be good to you as I was.

1045
01:14:32.875 --> 01:14:35.917
She's never going to do
the things that I do for you.

1046
01:14:37.917 --> 01:14:39.208
And to you…

1047
01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:43.708
She will never be enough

1048
01:14:44.208 --> 01:14:45.583
for you. Alex.

1049
01:14:53.375 --> 01:14:54.750
I'll still choose her.

1050
01:14:57.625 --> 01:14:59.333
I don't ever want to see you again. Uduak.

1051
01:14:59.792 --> 01:15:01.583
We're through. Move on.

1052
01:15:12.958 --> 01:15:15.708
Alex look. you don't know what
you're throwing away. do you hear me?

1053
01:15:16.625 --> 01:15:18.083
I hope… I hope she rejects you!

1054
01:15:18.375 --> 01:15:20.500
And when she does. don't come
running back to me. do you hear?

1055
01:15:20.708 --> 01:15:22.250
Don't come running back to me!

1056
01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.292
Alex! I hope…

1057
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:46.417
Yes. I'm on my way to the airport.

1058
01:15:48.250 --> 01:15:49.792
No. don't tell her. Don't tell her.

1059
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:51.958
I want to surprise her.

1060
01:15:53.583 --> 01:15:54.917
Yeah. Okay.

1061
01:16:42.708 --> 01:16:43.833
Bike! Stop!

1062
01:16:48.208 --> 01:16:49.208
Hey!

1063
01:16:50.917 --> 01:16:52.875
Driver. meet me at the address.

1064
01:18:51.583 --> 01:18:52.625
There you go.

1065
01:18:56.958 --> 01:18:58.167
What would you like?

1066
01:19:00.917 --> 01:19:01.917
Alex?

1067
01:19:02.458 --> 01:19:03.500
Yeah.

1068
01:19:05.375 --> 01:19:06.792
What are you doing here?

1069
01:19:07.375 --> 01:19:08.542
I’ve never tasted your cooking.

1070
01:19:08.792 --> 01:19:10.750
I figured if I made it here
today then I would.

1071
01:19:13.792 --> 01:19:15.000
Can I get a minute?

1072
01:19:17.917 --> 01:19:19.459
Sure. You guys cover up. okay?

1073
01:19:19.542 --> 01:19:21.208
I'll be right back.
Just give to the others.

1074
01:19:25.917 --> 01:19:27.458
What are you doing here?

1075
01:19:29.750 --> 01:19:31.667
I came to say what
I should have said a long time ago.

1076
01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:37.667
I came to ask if you'd still
like to… get ice cream with me.

1077
01:19:39.458 --> 01:19:41.000
And why should I say yes?

1078
01:19:41.542 --> 01:19:43.083
Because we both love ice cream.

1079
01:19:47.417 --> 01:19:48.542
Because I'm miserable without you.

1080
01:19:48.625 --> 01:19:50.917
You can't be miserable without me. Alex.

1081
01:19:51.042 --> 01:19:54.167
Okay? You have a girlfriend.
A fiancée. or whatever.

1082
01:19:54.625 --> 01:19:58.542
And you have some other…
bitches. Whatever she called them.

1083
01:19:58.625 --> 01:19:59.875
Bolanle. I love you.

1084
01:20:01.208 --> 01:20:02.583
Look. I love you.

1085
01:20:04.042 --> 01:20:06.125
I’ve loved you from the moment
I first heard your voice.

1086
01:20:12.875 --> 01:20:14.167
I’m sorry but I…

1087
01:20:15.125 --> 01:20:18.833
I’ve been through so much
this past year. I don’t believe you.

1088
01:20:18.917 --> 01:20:20.458
Bolanle. Bolanle. please.

1089
01:20:23.292 --> 01:20:24.500
Just give me a chance.

1090
01:20:25.542 --> 01:20:27.208
Give me a chance to prove myself to you.

1091
01:20:28.458 --> 01:20:31.417
To prove that I am the man for you
because you're the woman for me.

1092
01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:35.042
Just give me one more chance.

1093
01:20:43.958 --> 01:20:45.083
I’m sorry.

1094
01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:47.667
I can’t do this.

1095
01:20:53.792 --> 01:20:57.583
Maybe if you call me tonight.
I might pretend we’re starting afresh.

1096
01:21:01.375 --> 01:21:02.625
Call me. Alex.

1097
01:21:03.417 --> 01:21:04.542
I'll unblock you tonight.

1098
01:22:31.792 --> 01:22:34.417
<i>The first time</i>
<i>I heard the word. "corona."</i>

1099
01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:35.875
<i>I thought it was a myth.</i>

1100
01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:37.833
<i>But it was real.</i>

1101
01:22:38.500 --> 01:22:41.917
<i>As real as this man</i>
<i>with whom I’ve fallen in love.</i>

1102
01:22:50.625 --> 01:22:53.292
<i>And as real as the weight</i>
<i>that I'd put on during the pandemic</i>

1103
01:22:53.667 --> 01:22:55.917
<i>that is making me</i>
<i>work out so much right now.</i>

1104
01:22:59.583 --> 01:23:01.750
I never thought my life
would end up like this.

1105
01:23:02.250 --> 01:23:04.875
Despite coming second
in the cooking competition.

1106
01:23:05.375 --> 01:23:07.375
it jump-started my cooking career.

1107
01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.750
I am now an internet sensation.

1108
01:23:12.250 --> 01:23:13.750
A celebrity chef too.

1109
01:23:14.583 --> 01:23:16.708
You know. I entered the pandemic

1110
01:23:16.875 --> 01:23:20.208
thinking I had everything
I ever wanted in life.

1111
01:23:21.875 --> 01:23:23.625
I didn't know I was going to end it

1112
01:23:24.083 --> 01:23:25.333
on a different path…

1113
01:23:26.292 --> 01:23:27.875
chasing a different career.

1114
01:23:29.125 --> 01:23:32.458
loving a different man.

1115
01:23:32.958 --> 01:23:34.875
It's funny how life works out.

1116
01:23:35.167 --> 01:23:38.333
The thing you need the most
isn't even what you're searching for.

1117
01:23:39.375 --> 01:23:40.750
Excuse me.

1118
01:23:48.417 --> 01:23:49.417
Hey. babe.

1119
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:50.875
<i>Where are you?</i>

1120
01:23:51.167 --> 01:23:52.333
On my way home.

1121
01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.375
<i>Good. Can't wait to see you.</i>

1122
01:23:55.458 --> 01:23:57.333
Can't wait to see you too.

1123
01:24:01.458 --> 01:24:03.875
That was my story.

1124
01:24:04.667 --> 01:24:07.125
I hope you find your dreams
the same way I found mine.

1125
01:24:07.417 --> 01:24:08.583
Never settle.

1126
01:24:08.958 --> 01:24:12.583
because the life you need
just might be around the corner.

1127
01:24:13.417 --> 01:24:14.417
