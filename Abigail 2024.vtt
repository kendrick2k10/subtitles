-Negative.

57
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.781
We'll be out in nine.

58

Need a new pickup. Back gate.

- On it.

63
00:09:07.406 --> 00:09:09.346
All right.
I think we're in the clear.

Understood.

77
00:10:23.053 --> 00:10:25.018
Okay. there's cameras

Take a left down the alley

80
00:10:41.706 --> 00:10:44.269
-Not bad.

81
00:10:46.413 --> 00:10:47.639

All right. Y'all might want
to hold on to something.

86
00:10:56.384 --> 00:10:59.452
It's about to get

Set up a lookout position.

109
00:12:48.732 --> 00:12:50.835
Meet back here in five.

110
00:12:52.973 --> 00:12:57.003
For those of you who
don't know. I go by Lambert.

111
00:12:57.138 --> 00:12:58.703
<i>You all came
highly recommended.</i>

112
00:12:58.838 --> 00:13:01.973
<i>And so far. those

are paying off.</i>

113
00:13:02.109 --> 00:13:04.582
All right. Sweet dreams. Okay.

<i>You know the rules.</i>

115
00:13:06.146 --> 00:13:09.147
No real names. no backstories.

116
00:13:09.283 --> 00:13:11.652
and keep the grab-ass
to a minimum.

117
00:13:11.788 --> 00:13:14.725
It's a 24-hour job.

118
00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:16.987
<i>and the hard part
is already over.</i>

119
00:13:17.122 --> 00:13:19.061
<i>Now you babysit.</i>

120
00:13:20.395 --> 00:13:22.730
But the only one
that sees the girl is this one.

121
00:13:22.866 --> 00:13:24.962

122
00:13:25.097 --> 00:13:26.568

00:13:26.703 --> 00:13:28.134
<i>get comfortable.</i>

124
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.103
- Questions?
- Yeah. Who's the girl?

125
00:13:31.239 --> 00:13:33.511
You don't need
to know her name.

126
00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.807
I don't care about her name.

127
00:13:35.943 --> 00:13:37.344
Whose kid is she?

128
00:13:37.479 --> 00:13:39.882
- The fuck's that matter to you?
- A very wealthy man

129
00:13:40.018 --> 00:13:42.519
who's about to be
$50 million poorer.

130
00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:44.220
Look. you're safe here.

131
00:13:44.355 --> 00:13:46.889
And to be completely certain
that you can't be tracked.

132
00:13:47.025 --> 00:13:48.921
I'm going to collect
your cell phones.

133
00:13:49.056 --> 00:13:50.389
Nobody's tracking me.

134
00:13:50.525 --> 00:13:52.589
We're not taking any chances.
Give 'em over.

135
00:13:53.663 --> 00:13:54.727
In the bag.

136
00:13:54.862 --> 00:13:56.428
Bullshit. man.

137
00:13:57.531 --> 00:14:01.103
One second. I just gotta
send this real quick.

138
00:14:02.605 --> 00:14:03.935
Just...

139
00:14:04.071 --> 00:14:06.339
Thank you. Just... Okay.

140
00:14:08.481 --> 00:14:10.310
Thank you.

141
00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:23.258
Keep the doors locked
and the girl isolated.

142
00:14:23.393 --> 00:14:26.897
Anything else I can do for you
before I leave you to it?

143
00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:30.195
Uh. how come
we can't use our real names?

144
00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:31.800
So if any of you fucks
get caught.

145
00:14:31.936 --> 00:14:32.963
you can't rat out the others.

146
00:14:33.098 --> 00:14:34.233
Yeah. dumbass.

147
00:14:34.369 --> 00:14:36.837
You asked the same question
in the van.

148
00:14:36.973 --> 00:14:38.241
You want names?

149
00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:40.109
Fine.

150
00:14:41.007 --> 00:14:42.678

And you're Don fucking Rickles.
You happy?

155
00:14:50.984 --> 00:14:52.085
Not really.

156
00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:54.256
Who the fuck
is Don Rickles. man?

157
00:14:54.391 --> 00:14:56.552
There's clean bedding
and lit fires in the rooms.

00:16:02.327 --> 00:16:06.424
You grew up with a bunch of
brothers and sisters. huh?

185
00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:08.563
I'm like a expert
at reading people.

186
00:16:08.699 --> 00:16:09.629
Oh. really?

187
00:16:09.765 --> 00:16:10.966
Mm-hmm.

188
00:16:11.101 --> 00:16:13.196
You like a nanny
or a babysitter.

189
00:16:13.332 --> 00:16:16.106
looking after that kid.

190
00:16:17.007 --> 00:16:19.173
Your man here is the bagman

191
00:16:19.308 --> 00:16:21.645
for that dude
who let us in the door.

192
00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:25.011
Lookout/private security.

193
00:16:25.147 --> 00:16:27.444
Explosives man in the back.

194
00:16:27.579 --> 00:16:31.050
and a little
teenage runaway hacker

195
00:16:31.186 --> 00:16:34.291
turned black hat for the feds.

196
00:16:34.426 --> 00:16:35.618
Wow.

197
00:16:35.754 --> 00:16:37.890
You might be
the least perceptive person

198
00:16:38.026 --> 00:16:39.027
I've ever met.

199
00:16:39.162 --> 00:16:41.160
How the fuck
would you know that?

200
00:16:41.295 --> 00:16:43.500
You literally got nothing right.

201
00:16:43.635 --> 00:16:45.168
About anyone.

202
00:16:46.203 --> 00:16:48.267
Pretty sure
she ran away from home.

203
00:16:48.403 --> 00:16:50.105
- Crisp $100 bill.

204
00:16:50.241 --> 00:16:53.508
you can tell me
one true thing about me.

205
00:16:53.644 --> 00:16:54.938
Pass.

206
00:16:55.074 --> 00:16:56.341
Mm-hmm.

207
00:16:56.477 --> 00:16:58.709
Told y'all she ain't know shit.

208
00:17:01.687 --> 00:17:03.080
You used to be a cop.

209
00:17:03.216 --> 00:17:05.250
No way.

210
00:17:05.385 --> 00:17:07.225
Did he arrest you or something?

211
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:08.526
No.

212
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:09.824
It's the stance.

213
00:17:09.959 --> 00:17:11.929
The walk. The shoes.

214
00:17:12.065 --> 00:17:14.125
Not to mention
the standard-issue Glock.

215
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:15.825
the shoulder holster.

216
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.128
and he used police hand signals
back at the house.

217
00:17:18.264 --> 00:17:21.604
Not a street cop.

218
00:17:21.739 --> 00:17:24.741
No. Too smart.

219
00:17:24.876 --> 00:17:26.506
You need to be in control.

220
00:17:27.374 --> 00:17:30.147
So I'm gonna say detective.

221
00:17:30.782 --> 00:17:32.776
Homicide or vice.

222
00:17:32.911 --> 00:17:36.283
And he tries to hide it.
but he's from Queens.

223
00:17:36.418 --> 00:17:39.189
Probably only been up here
a few years.

224
00:17:43.455 --> 00:17:45.824
Hey. uh. you do me. too?

225
00:17:45.959 --> 00:17:46.991
Huh?

226
00:17:47.127 --> 00:17:48.825
Right here.

227
00:17:51.464 --> 00:17:54.568
I almost feel bad taking this...

228
00:17:54.703 --> 00:17:56.907
'cause you've basically got
a fucking neon sign

229
00:17:57.042 --> 00:17:59.110
over your head
that reads "muscle."

230
00:17:59.909 --> 00:18:01.305
Quebec. right?

231
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:04.010
You got bullied in school?

232
00:18:04.145 --> 00:18:05.675
Probably by Dad. too.

233
00:18:05.811 --> 00:18:07.684
So when you got bigger
than everyone else.

234
00:18:07.819 --> 00:18:09.345
you turned the tables.

235
00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.518
Made it into a career.

236
00:18:12.858 --> 00:18:14.590
How much will this get me?

237
00:18:14.726 --> 00:18:15.953
Wow. Really?

238
00:18:16.089 --> 00:18:17.392
A 20?

239
00:18:17.527 --> 00:18:20.029
That's cheap. considering
you come from money.

240
00:18:20.164 --> 00:18:21.361
- It's true.
-Which means

241
00:18:21.496 --> 00:18:23.197
you're only in this
for the kicks.

242
00:18:23.332 --> 00:18:25.034
You don't get your hands dirty.

243
00:18:25.169 --> 00:18:26.929
You use a keyboard
instead of a gun

244
00:18:27.065 --> 00:18:29.600
and tell yourself that makes
what you do not as bad.

245
00:18:29.735 --> 00:18:32.440
Good luck
when the illusion wears off.

246
00:18:33.073 --> 00:18:34.172
Very good.

247
00:18:38.749 --> 00:18:39.746
No cash.

248
00:18:39.881 --> 00:18:41.580
Mm.

249
00:18:41.715 --> 00:18:44.518
Then I'll just leave it
at "semper fi."

250
00:18:45.683 --> 00:18:48.654
And you're getting off easy.

251
00:18:50.656 --> 00:18:52.995
Hold on. now.
you forgot about me.

252
00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:54.291
You don't want me to do you.

253
00:18:54.427 --> 00:18:56.327
What you mean? This fun.

254
00:18:56.463 --> 00:18:58.829
You're not a professional.

255
00:19:00.967 --> 00:19:03.536
I'm the best motherfucking
wheelman in this town.

256
00:19:03.672 --> 00:19:05.306
I didn't say you weren't good.

257
00:19:05.441 --> 00:19:08.307
I said you're not
a professional.

258
00:19:08.442 --> 00:19:11.847
You've got... loose wiring.

259
00:19:11.982 --> 00:19:14.350
Probably a sociopath.

260
00:19:16.514 --> 00:19:18.816
And you are a junkie.

261
00:19:23.092 --> 00:19:24.421
Cop knows a junkie.

262
00:19:24.557 --> 00:19:28.529
Your little candy affectation.

263
00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:31.399
Long sleeves.

264
00:19:31.535 --> 00:19:33.501
Why you don't want
to have a drink with us.

265
00:19:33.637 --> 00:19:35.698
You in recovery or something?
How many days you got?

266
00:19:35.834 --> 00:19:37.936
- We gotta be worried about you?
- No.

267
00:19:38.071 --> 00:19:39.672
No?

268
00:19:40.672 --> 00:19:43.247
Don't ever fuck with me.

269
00:19:44.046 --> 00:19:46.646
I will know.

270
00:19:47.449 --> 00:19:49.880
I'm gonna go check on the girl.

271
00:19:52.521 --> 00:19:56.392
I knew it.
Junkies never share candy.

272
00:20:03.561 --> 00:20:05.236
What's happening?

273
00:20:06.201 --> 00:20:07.567
How are you feeling?

274
00:20:07.702 --> 00:20:11.407
Where am I? Who are you?

275
00:20:12.208 --> 00:20:13.372
I can't tell you that.

276
00:20:13.508 --> 00:20:16.077
- I want to go home.
- Me. too.

277
00:20:16.213 --> 00:20:17.814
But we can't just yet.

278
00:20:17.949 --> 00:20:19.048
Hopefully very soon.

279
00:20:19.183 --> 00:20:20.883
Can you take the blindfold off?

280
00:20:21.019 --> 00:20:23.386
It's really tight.

281
00:20:45.307 --> 00:20:47.172
Are the cuffs hurting you?

282
00:20:49.145 --> 00:20:51.711
My arms are sore.

283
00:20:54.018 --> 00:20:55.253
Sit up.

284
00:21:01.353 --> 00:21:03.360
Thanks.

285
00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:13.469
- Better?

286
00:21:16.439 --> 00:21:18.705
What's going on?

287
00:21:19.639 --> 00:21:20.771
We're keeping you here

288
00:21:20.906 --> 00:21:22.742
until your father gives us
some money.

289
00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:27.649
- Do you know who my father is?
- No.

290
00:21:27.784 --> 00:21:29.850
And we don't want to know.
so don't tell me.

291
00:21:29.986 --> 00:21:31.113
Can I...

292
00:21:31.249 --> 00:21:33.918
Are you hungry? I could
bring you something to eat.

293
00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:36.857
Are you gonna hurt me?

294
00:21:36.992 --> 00:21:38.523
No.

295
00:21:38.658 --> 00:21:41.662
If you behave and do as we say.

296
00:21:41.798 --> 00:21:44.301
and if your dad gives us money.
you'll be fine.

297
00:21:44.437 --> 00:21:47.364
In the meantime.
I'm here to keep you safe

298
00:21:47.499 --> 00:21:49.472
and comfortable.

299
00:21:50.107 --> 00:21:51.505
Can you promise me

300
00:21:51.641 --> 00:21:54.076
you're not gonna
let anybody hurt me?

301
00:21:54.212 --> 00:21:56.677
I'll do you one better.

302
00:21:58.247 --> 00:21:59.976
I pinkie-promise you

303
00:22:00.111 --> 00:22:03.387
that I'm not gonna let
anyone hurt you.

304
00:22:10.556 --> 00:22:12.055
What's your name?

305
00:22:13.693 --> 00:22:16.526
Um... Oh. you can call me Joey.

306
00:22:16.661 --> 00:22:19.535
Do you have any kids?

307
00:22:24.207 --> 00:22:26.073
I have a little boy.

308
00:22:26.208 --> 00:22:27.376
About your age.

309
00:22:27.512 --> 00:22:30.079
What's his name?
Mine's Abigail.

310
00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:32.108
I can't tell you his name.

311
00:22:32.244 --> 00:22:35.449
- Can I make one up?
- I'd rather you didn't.

312
00:22:35.584 --> 00:22:38.488
I'm just gonna call him Justin.

313
00:22:40.422 --> 00:22:42.459
What's Justin like?

314
00:22:43.291 --> 00:22:45.993
He's...

315
00:22:46.128 --> 00:22:47.698
just a...

316
00:22:47.834 --> 00:22:49.697
normal kid.

317
00:22:50.662 --> 00:22:52.496
What does he like?

318
00:22:52.631 --> 00:22:55.098
Just normal kid stuff.

319
00:22:56.970 --> 00:23:00.037
I don't really know
about kid stuff.

320
00:23:02.409 --> 00:23:04.412
My dad. well...

321
00:23:04.548 --> 00:23:08.018
he thought
he wanted a child. but...

322
00:23:08.154 --> 00:23:10.146
then he just lost interest.

323
00:23:12.487 --> 00:23:13.886
You've made a mistake.

324
00:23:15.458 --> 00:23:17.857
He doesn't care about me.

325
00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.128
I'm gonna leave you alone now.

326
00:23:26.302 --> 00:23:27.431
I'll be back soon.

327
00:23:27.567 --> 00:23:29.099
Really soon. okay?

328
00:23:30.436 --> 00:23:32.410
Okay.

329
00:23:36.245 --> 00:23:39.010
- Joey?
- Yeah?

330
00:23:41.148 --> 00:23:44.722
I'm sorry about
what's gonna happen to you.

331
00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:50.454
- Yeah. motherfucker!
-Oh!

332
00:23:50.589 --> 00:23:52.263
Drink. bitch!

333
00:23:52.398 --> 00:23:54.292
- I really don't want to.

334
00:23:54.428 --> 00:23:55.429
Oh. my God.

335
00:23:55.565 --> 00:23:57.762
- I like your tattoos.
- Mm-hmm.

336
00:23:57.897 --> 00:24:00.130
Do they have. uh.
a meaning or...

337
00:24:00.265 --> 00:24:01.935
We're not supposed
to get personal. big boy.

338
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:03.934
Well. I know. but
I like your little demon guy.

339
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.004
I just said it's too personal.

340
00:24:06.139 --> 00:24:09.579
Thank you. You don't even
know my name. man.

341
00:24:11.912 --> 00:24:13.750
- How's the kid?
- She's fine.

342
00:24:13.885 --> 00:24:16.747
Look. I don't need to know
who the girl's father is.

343
00:24:16.882 --> 00:24:19.653
- but do you know?
- No. Why?

344
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:21.490
She just implied
that her father might be

345
00:24:21.626 --> 00:24:24.254
- a particularly violent man.
-  Wow.

346
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:26.956
She implied that. did she?
Well...

347
00:24:27.092 --> 00:24:28.695
of course
she fucking implied that.

348
00:24:28.831 --> 00:24:30.897
She's scared.
She wants to rattle you.

349
00:24:31.598 --> 00:24:32.863
I don't think so.

350
00:24:32.999 --> 00:24:36.470
Again. do you know
who her father is?

351
00:24:36.605 --> 00:24:37.704
Oh. my God. you're gonna be

352
00:24:37.839 --> 00:24:39.538
a real pain in my ass.
aren't you?

353
00:24:39.674 --> 00:24:42.172
There's one in every crew.

354
00:24:43.916 --> 00:24:45.177
No. sir.

355
00:24:45.312 --> 00:24:48.750
I just don't scare easy.
so when I do. I pay attention.

356
00:24:51.488 --> 00:24:52.918
Yes! I like that one.

357
00:24:53.054 --> 00:24:54.224
You're just missing
so you have to finish

358
00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:55.491
the whole bottle. aren't you?

359
00:24:55.627 --> 00:24:56.689
I don't know why
you would say that.

360
00:24:56.825 --> 00:24:58.424
- Oh. that's bad.

361
00:24:58.559 --> 00:24:59.824
- Ha!
- I like you.

362
00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:01.264
- You're scary. though.
- Really?

363
00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:02.264
-Scary?
-Yeah.

364
00:25:02.399 --> 00:25:03.395
Why am I scary?

365
00:25:03.531 --> 00:25:05.161
- Ha!

366
00:25:05.296 --> 00:25:07.404
-You're funny.

367
00:25:07.539 --> 00:25:08.768
- Oh. that's bad.
-Your turn.

368
00:25:08.903 --> 00:25:10.941
I don't have a quarter. man.

369
00:25:15.345 --> 00:25:17.113
Oh. fuck!

370
00:25:17.248 --> 00:25:19.075
Fuck! Shit. Christ.

371
00:25:19.211 --> 00:25:20.846
Look away!
Don't fucking look at me!

372
00:25:20.982 --> 00:25:23.747
You see my face?
You see my fucking face?

373
00:25:23.882 --> 00:25:25.354
Huh? Are you lying to me?

374
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:26.755
- No.
- You fucking lying to me?

375
00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:28.152
- No. I'm-I'm not!
- Don't lie to me.

376
00:25:28.287 --> 00:25:30.724
What color are my eyes?
What color are my eyes?!

377
00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:31.887
It's a simple
fucking question. kid!

378
00:25:32.023 --> 00:25:33.359
I didn't see your face!

379
00:25:33.494 --> 00:25:35.561
Well... good!

380
00:25:35.697 --> 00:25:38.196
Who the fuck is your father?

381
00:25:39.133 --> 00:25:41.030
Jo... Joey said
you didn't want to know.

382
00:25:41.165 --> 00:25:42.735
Well. fuck Joey!
I do want to know!

383
00:25:42.871 --> 00:25:44.635
- Who the fuck is your father?
- Okay.

384
00:25:44.770 --> 00:25:46.035
I'm-I'm sorry.

385
00:25:46.171 --> 00:25:49.045
- Who is your father?
- My father is...

386
00:25:51.182 --> 00:25:52.979
Kristof Lazaar.

387
00:25:54.615 --> 00:25:56.016
The fuck did you say?

388
00:25:57.987 --> 00:26:00.455
♪ Why don't
you hear me cryin'? ♪

389
00:26:00.591 --> 00:26:02.451
♪ Ooh. ooh. ooh. ooh. ooh ♪

390
00:26:03.254 --> 00:26:06.630
- ♪ A-whoo-hoo... ♪

391
00:26:07.466 --> 00:26:09.560
Yo. what's going on. bagman?

392
00:26:09.695 --> 00:26:10.993
I'm leaving.

393
00:26:11.128 --> 00:26:12.469
- What?
-You heard me.

394
00:26:12.604 --> 00:26:14.465
You cut up my share
however you want.

395
00:26:14.601 --> 00:26:15.771
I'm out.

396
00:26:16.637 --> 00:26:18.074
Whoa. Hey.

397
00:26:18.209 --> 00:26:19.539
What happened?

398
00:26:19.675 --> 00:26:21.071
Hey! You can't just leave

399
00:26:21.207 --> 00:26:22.979
without telling us
what's going on.

400
00:26:23.114 --> 00:26:25.814
What's going on? What's going
on is that we are fucked.

401
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:28.946
That little girl is
Kristof Lazaar's daughter.

402
00:26:29.081 --> 00:26:31.549
- Shit.
- Who's Kristof Lazaar?

403
00:26:31.685 --> 00:26:32.786
Who's Lazaar?

404
00:26:32.921 --> 00:26:35.489
Bruh.
that's a urban legend. man.

405
00:26:35.624 --> 00:26:36.789
- Calm down.
- No. dude.

406
00:26:36.924 --> 00:26:38.593
He's not a fucking urban legend.

407
00:26:38.729 --> 00:26:40.796
He is very fucking real.
believe me.

408
00:26:40.931 --> 00:26:43.531
Nobody even knows how big
his fucking empire is.

409
00:26:43.666 --> 00:26:44.864
So he's. like. a crime boss?

410
00:26:44.999 --> 00:26:46.667
He controls a lot more
than just crime.

411
00:26:46.802 --> 00:26:48.538
Is Lambert fucking insane?

412
00:26:48.673 --> 00:26:50.370
He just put a death mark
on all of us.

413
00:26:50.506 --> 00:26:51.440
Including himself.

414
00:26:51.575 --> 00:26:52.972
What if we just. like.

415
00:26:53.107 --> 00:26:55.506
you know. like. give her back
and say sorry?

416
00:26:55.641 --> 00:26:56.944
Oh. yeah.

417
00:26:57.079 --> 00:26:58.541
"Here's your daughter.
Mr. fucking Antichrist.

418
00:26:58.676 --> 00:27:01.111
"We're really sorry.
Hope she's not too traumatized.

419
00:27:01.247 --> 00:27:03.185
Let's play a round of golf
sometime."

420
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.279
Fuck you. Frank.

421
00:27:04.415 --> 00:27:07.350
This isn't the time
for sarcasm. okay?

422
00:27:10.394 --> 00:27:11.928
Let's just leave.

423
00:27:12.064 --> 00:27:14.396
We leave her with some food and
make an anonymous phone call.

424
00:27:14.531 --> 00:27:15.563
get the fuck out of Dodge.

425
00:27:15.699 --> 00:27:16.897
- I like that.

426
00:27:17.032 --> 00:27:18.094
It's not like
she's seen our faces.

427
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:21.233
Uh. actually. she has.
thanks to you.

428
00:27:21.369 --> 00:27:24.101
I was supposed to be the only
one in and out of that room.

429
00:27:24.237 --> 00:27:26.676
- And I wore my mask.
- Well. I didn't.

430
00:27:26.811 --> 00:27:29.004
so I walk in there
to see Angelina Ballerina

431
00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:31.077
memorizing my fucking face.

432
00:27:32.482 --> 00:27:33.880
Major party foul.

433
00:27:34.016 --> 00:27:35.481
Why did you take off
her blindfold. Joey?

434
00:27:35.616 --> 00:27:36.582
It's messy.

435
00:27:36.718 --> 00:27:38.386
Now we have to kill her.

436
00:27:38.521 --> 00:27:39.653
Not a fucking chance.

437
00:27:39.788 --> 00:27:41.225
We're not killing the girl.

438
00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.790
She saw Frank's face.

439
00:27:42.926 --> 00:27:44.658
Even if Lazaar
catches up to him.

440
00:27:44.794 --> 00:27:46.088
he don't know shit about us.

441
00:27:46.223 --> 00:27:47.597
He knows that I'm Quebecois.

442
00:27:47.733 --> 00:27:49.392
Huh? He knows
that Sammy comes from money.

443
00:27:49.527 --> 00:27:51.695
He knows that you come
from a military background.

444
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.199
thanks to Joey.

445
00:27:53.334 --> 00:27:55.831
Just had to do your little
magic trick. didn't you?

446
00:27:55.967 --> 00:27:57.307
Hold up.

447
00:27:57.442 --> 00:27:59.334
If we just leave her here.

448
00:27:59.470 --> 00:28:01.711
then we don't get
none of that money?

449
00:28:01.846 --> 00:28:05.415
Kind of need some money
real bad right now.

450
00:28:05.551 --> 00:28:06.910
I don't know about y'all.

451
00:28:07.046 --> 00:28:08.416
How much do you trust Lambert?

452
00:28:08.551 --> 00:28:11.249
I trust him enough.

453
00:28:11.384 --> 00:28:13.922
That doesn't make it
worth the risk. though.

454
00:28:16.456 --> 00:28:18.722
If seven million per person
isn't worth the risk.

455
00:28:18.857 --> 00:28:20.431
then what is?

456
00:28:20.566 --> 00:28:22.964
It's a lot of money.

457
00:28:26.664 --> 00:28:28.772
All right. he wouldn't have
had us kidnap the kid

458
00:28:28.907 --> 00:28:30.604
if he didn't think
we could pull this off.

459
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:31.938
so maybe we all just pretend

460
00:28:32.074 --> 00:28:33.776
like we don't know
who her father is.

461
00:28:33.912 --> 00:28:35.577
and with the money
we're making from this.

462
00:28:35.712 --> 00:28:37.374
we just disappear forever. Hmm?

463
00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:39.442
<i>Start a new life.</i>

464
00:28:39.577 --> 00:28:42.582
I never have to see
any of you fucks ever again.

465
00:28:42.717 --> 00:28:45.150
Everyone stay alert.

466
00:28:45.286 --> 00:28:47.284
<i>Any threat is
gonna come from outside.</i>

467
00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.024
<i>so we set a perimeter
and we hold it.</i>

468
00:28:50.159 --> 00:28:52.494
Rickles takes first watch
in the crow's nest.

469
00:28:52.629 --> 00:28:54.430
Joey. secure the interior.

470
00:28:54.566 --> 00:28:56.459
<i>Look for any ways in or out.</i>

471
00:28:58.167 --> 00:29:03.136
<i>What is it. like.
22 more hours. hmm?</i>

472
00:29:04.638 --> 00:29:05.835
22 hours.

473
00:29:08.246 --> 00:29:09.206
Fuck.

474
00:29:09.342 --> 00:29:12.013
-What a dick.

475
00:31:24.817 --> 00:31:26.112
I thought I heard someone
out here.

476
00:31:26.247 --> 00:31:29.385
I'm not as stealthy
as I thought.

477
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:31.515
Want to come in?

478
00:31:33.117 --> 00:31:34.758
I sort of have

479
00:31:34.894 --> 00:31:38.260
this reputation
of being a professional.

480
00:31:38.396 --> 00:31:39.255
So...

481
00:31:39.390 --> 00:31:41.965
And so you have to do your job.

482
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.232
Hey. listen.

483
00:31:50.173 --> 00:31:53.075
I don't trust
any of these other fucks.

484
00:31:54.243 --> 00:31:57.080
So let's watch
each other's backs.

485
00:31:57.716 --> 00:32:00.346
I was thinking the same thing.

486
00:32:38.917 --> 00:32:41.557
<i>I'm that
hungry little kitty cat</i>

487
00:32:41.693 --> 00:32:43.425
<i>you just read about.</i>

488
00:32:45.658 --> 00:32:50.193
<i>I'm so hungry I could eat a...
a woodpecker.</i>

489
00:32:50.328 --> 00:32:52.365
<i>Yeah. that's it.</i>

490
00:32:53.001 --> 00:32:54.805
Oh. my God!

491
00:32:54.940 --> 00:32:56.673
- What the fuck?!
- No. it-it's me.

492
00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:57.973
It's Dean. it's Dean.

493
00:32:58.108 --> 00:33:00.236
- I'm sorry.
- What the fuck. Dean?!

494
00:33:00.372 --> 00:33:01.811
Just was trying to prank you.

495
00:33:01.947 --> 00:33:02.940
- I'm sorry.
- It's not funny.

496
00:33:03.075 --> 00:33:04.008
You can have it.

497
00:33:04.143 --> 00:33:05.344
- Get out!
- Listen.

498
00:33:05.479 --> 00:33:07.249
I saw the way you was
looking at me earlier.

499
00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:10.686
and I thought we could just.
like. you know. vibe out or...

500
00:33:10.822 --> 00:33:12.054
- Get the fuck out!
- Hey.

501
00:33:12.190 --> 00:33:13.351
- I'm not looking at you. man.
- Whoa. whoa.

502
00:33:13.487 --> 00:33:15.187
- Wait. wait. wait. wait.
- Get the fuck out!

503
00:33:15.322 --> 00:33:16.453
- Stupid motherfucker!

504
00:33:16.588 --> 00:33:18.088
- God!
- I didn't mean to scare you.

505
00:33:18.224 --> 00:33:19.656
I don't give a shit!

506
00:33:21.426 --> 00:33:24.067
- Are you sure?
- Fuck off!

507
00:33:25.098 --> 00:33:26.899
Get the fuck out!

508
00:33:27.034 --> 00:33:29.166
Go! Get the fuck out!

509
00:33:29.301 --> 00:33:31.640
- All right.
- Get out!

510
00:33:31.775 --> 00:33:33.209
Don't come back!

511
00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:34.941
-<i>Now.
my fine pigeon...
- </i>

512
00:33:35.077 --> 00:33:38.015
<i>I'm going to pick you dry.</i>

513
00:35:00.929 --> 00:35:03.793
What the fuck?

514
00:35:29.055 --> 00:35:31.227
Hello?

515
00:35:36.898 --> 00:35:39.268
Hello?

516
00:35:50.408 --> 00:35:52.776
Is someone down there?

517
00:36:07.559 --> 00:36:10.200
- What the fuck?!

518
00:36:12.832 --> 00:36:15.604
Scared the shit out of me.
little motherfuckers.

519
00:36:17.105 --> 00:36:19.072
Man. fuck this shit.

520
00:36:28.513 --> 00:36:31.819
Ow! Oh. shit!

521
00:36:31.954 --> 00:36:33.583
Help me! Help...

522
00:36:33.718 --> 00:36:35.319
<i>You're just in time for dinner.</i>

523
00:36:35.454 --> 00:36:36.587
<i>Yeah?</i>

524
00:36:36.722 --> 00:36:38.958
<i>What are you going to have
for dinner?</i>

525
00:36:39.093 --> 00:36:42.793
Help me! Help!

526
00:36:49.839 --> 00:36:51.703
Dean?

527
00:36:55.743 --> 00:36:58.545
Dean. you better not be
fucking with me again.

528
00:37:08.318 --> 00:37:10.293
Hey!

529
00:37:47.931 --> 00:37:50.960
Stupid.

530
00:37:55.466 --> 00:37:57.169
You little shit.

531
00:37:57.304 --> 00:37:59.903
Can't...

532
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.652
Sammy?

533
00:38:16.356 --> 00:38:17.954
What? What happened?

534
00:38:18.756 --> 00:38:21.126
His head fell off.

535
00:38:21.262 --> 00:38:22.926
I don't know.

536
00:38:23.928 --> 00:38:26.661
Why do you have a dick
on your face?

537
00:38:26.797 --> 00:38:29.067
- What?
- Just go get them.

538
00:38:29.203 --> 00:38:30.600
Go get them!

539
00:38:30.735 --> 00:38:32.741
- Okay.

540
00:38:32.877 --> 00:38:34.809
Okay. Okay.

541
00:38:34.945 --> 00:38:36.775
Help! Help!

542
00:38:44.181 --> 00:38:46.618
What the fuck were you doing
down here. anyway?

543
00:38:46.754 --> 00:38:48.919
I couldn't sleep.
I heard something.

544
00:38:49.054 --> 00:38:52.295
What. you just had to come
and check it out. huh?

545
00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:55.498
You think I could do that?

546
00:38:56.401 --> 00:38:58.435
Be honest. What does that
look like to you?

547
00:38:58.570 --> 00:39:01.404
It looks like a fucking
wild animal ripped him apart.

548
00:39:02.833 --> 00:39:05.240
No. No. No. I'm not fu...

549
00:39:05.375 --> 00:39:06.973
We're not fucking going there.

550
00:39:07.108 --> 00:39:08.275
Oh. fuck.

551
00:39:08.410 --> 00:39:10.610
Why are you all acting so weird?

552
00:39:10.746 --> 00:39:14.150
There are stories
about Lazaar's hit man.

553
00:39:14.286 --> 00:39:16.646
- Can we not do this. please?
- Valdez.

554
00:39:16.782 --> 00:39:18.554
I heard a story once.

555
00:39:18.690 --> 00:39:21.353
Three of Lazaar's top guys
got pinched a few years ago.

556
00:39:21.488 --> 00:39:22.721
The FBI flipped 'em.

557
00:39:22.857 --> 00:39:24.554
Night before the trial.
they were all holed up

558
00:39:24.690 --> 00:39:26.022
on the top floor of a hotel.

559
00:39:26.158 --> 00:39:28.363
A dozen agents in the next room
and two on the door.

560
00:39:28.498 --> 00:39:31.266
Next morning.
FBI goes into the room.

561
00:39:31.401 --> 00:39:33.563
All they bodies
are ripped apart.

562
00:39:33.699 --> 00:39:36.901
Limbs... and organs missing.

563
00:39:37.535 --> 00:39:39.834
Decapitations.

564
00:39:39.970 --> 00:39:43.474
That's his signature. Valdez.

565
00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:45.777
He's a fucking animal.

566
00:39:45.912 --> 00:39:47.780
And there was no way
in and out of that room

567
00:39:47.916 --> 00:39:50.981
except for the front door
or the 23rd-story window.

568
00:39:52.156 --> 00:39:53.586
So how'd he do it?

569
00:39:53.722 --> 00:39:57.286
- Bullshit.
- It's not fucking bullshit.

570
00:39:58.255 --> 00:40:00.427
That's not the first time
I heard that story.

571
00:40:00.562 --> 00:40:02.630
We'd better check on the girl.

572
00:40:09.406 --> 00:40:11.240
All right. let's game this out.

573
00:40:11.376 --> 00:40:13.075
If Valdez
or anyone else is in here.

574
00:40:13.211 --> 00:40:15.979
that means Lambert gave us up.

575
00:40:16.114 --> 00:40:17.272
And I don't buy that.

576
00:40:17.407 --> 00:40:20.379
Or Lazaar got to him and
beat our location out of him.

577
00:40:20.515 --> 00:40:21.976
Are you fucking kidding me?

578
00:40:22.112 --> 00:40:23.547
Lambert is
a meticulous motherfucker.

579
00:40:23.683 --> 00:40:25.147
He's very. very careful.

580
00:40:25.283 --> 00:40:27.751
If he gave us up. that means
either one of us did it

581
00:40:27.886 --> 00:40:30.256
or Valdez is in here
and he did it.

582
00:40:30.392 --> 00:40:32.792
Or one of us is Valdez.

583
00:40:35.029 --> 00:40:38.666
I. for one. would like to
revisit the cut-and-run idea.

584
00:40:41.666 --> 00:40:43.502
Yeah. but...

585
00:40:43.637 --> 00:40:46.506
Wrinkles. now that Dean is dead.

586
00:40:46.641 --> 00:40:48.839
- we have a bigger share.

587
00:40:48.974 --> 00:40:50.579
You're welcome to my share.
Pete.

588
00:40:50.714 --> 00:40:52.341
You could be the richest
headless man in America.

589
00:40:52.477 --> 00:40:54.451
Okay.

590
00:40:55.318 --> 00:40:57.216
- He just died.
- Okay.

591
00:40:57.351 --> 00:40:59.522
So messed up.

592
00:41:00.751 --> 00:41:02.756
Hello?

593
00:41:04.688 --> 00:41:06.223
She's fine.

594
00:41:06.359 --> 00:41:07.997
Just because she's
still in there doesn't mean

595
00:41:08.133 --> 00:41:10.360
that Valdez is not here.

596
00:41:10.496 --> 00:41:12.329
I'm out.

597
00:41:12.465 --> 00:41:13.903
You coming?

598
00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.209
Suit yourself.

599
00:41:19.344 --> 00:41:21.973
- You're leaving?
- Bye-bye.

600
00:41:23.247 --> 00:41:24.672
Bye. Wrinkles.

601
00:41:24.808 --> 00:41:27.244
Come on.

602
00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.618
Rickles.

603
00:41:30.250 --> 00:41:31.851
Hey!

604
00:41:38.992 --> 00:41:42.191
Where the fuck
did that come from?

605
00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.262
What the fuck?

606
00:41:50.570 --> 00:41:52.237
Wrinkles.

607
00:41:52.373 --> 00:41:53.906
Stand back.

608
00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.923
It's locked.

609
00:42:07.058 --> 00:42:08.551
Thanks. Peter.

610
00:42:26.675 --> 00:42:30.611
Uh... what the fuck
is happening?

611
00:42:30.747 --> 00:42:32.613
I think that. uh.
trying the door.

612
00:42:32.749 --> 00:42:34.984
it. uh... it-it triggered it
or something.

613
00:42:35.119 --> 00:42:37.314
Fuck.

614
00:42:39.984 --> 00:42:42.020
This whole thing is a trap.

615
00:42:42.928 --> 00:42:43.755
Shit!

616
00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:45.393
Wrinkles! Where's...?

617
00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:46.958
Hey. Where's Wrinkles going?

618
00:42:47.094 --> 00:42:48.760
If this is Valdez.
maybe he checked on the girl

619
00:42:48.895 --> 00:42:50.398
and left her there
to throw us off.

620
00:42:50.534 --> 00:42:53.031
I'll see what I can find out.

621
00:42:57.735 --> 00:42:59.708
What the fuck?

622
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:07.446
I need to ask you something.

623
00:43:07.581 --> 00:43:08.781
Has anyone besides me

624
00:43:08.917 --> 00:43:11.150
and the man with the glasses
been in here?

625
00:43:11.285 --> 00:43:12.681
No.

626
00:43:12.816 --> 00:43:14.789
No one at all?

627
00:43:15.553 --> 00:43:17.220
No.

628
00:43:19.392 --> 00:43:21.259
Hey.

629
00:43:22.363 --> 00:43:26.328
Can you pinkie-promise me that
you're not keeping a secret?

630
00:43:31.504 --> 00:43:32.801
Abigail.

631
00:43:32.937 --> 00:43:35.103
He's gonna hurt me.

632
00:43:35.238 --> 00:43:38.077
- Who?
- The man with the glasses.

633
00:43:38.212 --> 00:43:41.915
He told me I had to keep
a secret or he'd hurt me.

634
00:43:42.582 --> 00:43:44.181
What did he say?

635
00:43:45.786 --> 00:43:48.922
It's okay. You can tell me.

636
00:43:51.227 --> 00:43:52.426
Abigail.

637
00:43:52.562 --> 00:43:53.858
- Hey.

638
00:43:53.993 --> 00:43:56.158
I'm not gonna let him hurt you.

639
00:43:56.293 --> 00:43:59.097
But I need you
to tell me what he said.

640
00:44:01.868 --> 00:44:04.338
He said he works for my father.

641
00:44:04.474 --> 00:44:07.239
He said his name was...

642
00:44:07.375 --> 00:44:09.341
Valdez.

643
00:44:11.581 --> 00:44:13.276
I need to talk to you right now.

644
00:44:13.978 --> 00:44:15.916
I'll be right outside.

645
00:44:20.887 --> 00:44:22.890
Someone stole my fucking rifle.

646
00:44:23.722 --> 00:44:24.953
Frank is Valdez.

647
00:44:25.089 --> 00:44:26.488
- What?
- He told the girl.

648
00:44:26.623 --> 00:44:28.464
Frank wanted to leave.
That doesn't make any sense.

649
00:44:28.599 --> 00:44:30.633
He acted
like he wanted to leave.

650
00:44:30.769 --> 00:44:32.597
If he's Valdez
and Lazaar's his boss.

651
00:44:32.733 --> 00:44:33.966
then why kidnap his kid?

652
00:44:34.102 --> 00:44:36.464
Maybe he and Lambert
are planning a power play.

653
00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:40.402
That skinny
motherfucker rips people apart?

654
00:44:42.139 --> 00:44:44.373
Something doesn't add up.

655
00:44:47.147 --> 00:44:50.618
Aside from Frank.
these guys are amateurs.

656
00:44:50.753 --> 00:44:52.985
- You're Army. right?
- Medic.

657
00:44:53.120 --> 00:44:56.385
- We can take 'em.
- We can take 'em.

658
00:44:56.520 --> 00:44:58.219
If it's Frank.
he'll know how to get out.

659
00:44:58.354 --> 00:44:59.889
Which means
so would I if I spend

660
00:45:00.025 --> 00:45:01.593
about six minutes with him.

661
00:45:01.729 --> 00:45:02.994
You take the other two.

662
00:45:03.130 --> 00:45:05.696
Take the main staircase
while I go south.

663
00:45:05.831 --> 00:45:07.363
We meet in the middle.

664
00:45:08.131 --> 00:45:10.006
We gonna get through this.

665
00:45:10.141 --> 00:45:11.338
I have to.

666
00:45:11.473 --> 00:45:13.336
You have a kid?

667
00:45:17.813 --> 00:45:19.914
We'll make sure you get home.

668
00:45:44.175 --> 00:45:45.638
Rickles?

669
00:46:27.277 --> 00:46:29.918
This is so fucking disgusting.

670
00:46:32.588 --> 00:46:34.355
God. what the fuck?

671
00:46:34.491 --> 00:46:36.320
Where's Frank?

672
00:46:45.131 --> 00:46:47.969
Don't point that at Sammy. Joey.

673
00:46:49.967 --> 00:46:50.968
Seen Frank?

674
00:46:51.104 --> 00:46:52.268
House this fancy. you'd think

675
00:46:52.404 --> 00:46:54.474
they could put fucking towels
in the...

676
00:46:54.609 --> 00:46:55.905
Oh. Hey. Joey.

677
00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.742
What's going on?

678
00:46:57.877 --> 00:46:59.574
Why'd you do it?

679
00:47:00.647 --> 00:47:01.549
Do what?

680
00:47:01.684 --> 00:47:03.314
Bring us here to kill us.

681
00:47:07.789 --> 00:47:09.651
Don't do it. Peter!

682
00:47:09.786 --> 00:47:11.761
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

683
00:47:11.896 --> 00:47:13.357
but you don't sound
very calm right now.

684
00:47:13.492 --> 00:47:16.459
Little Miss Paranoid.
so forgive the precaution.

685
00:47:16.595 --> 00:47:18.231
You guys know what the fuck
she's talking about?

686
00:47:18.366 --> 00:47:21.503
I think she thinks that
you brought us here to kill us.

687
00:47:21.639 --> 00:47:24.268
Wow. Fantastic insight. Peter.

688
00:47:24.404 --> 00:47:27.342
Care to share
what's on your mind. Joey?

689
00:47:27.478 --> 00:47:28.336
You're Valdez.

690
00:47:28.471 --> 00:47:31.040
You told the girl.
you killed Dean.

691
00:47:31.176 --> 00:47:33.008
and you just killed Rickles.

692
00:47:33.143 --> 00:47:34.576
Mr. Wrinkles is dead?

693
00:47:36.019 --> 00:47:37.820
- I didn't tell that girl shit.
- Bullshit.

694
00:47:37.955 --> 00:47:39.582
Wow. You got a lot
going on up there. junkie.

695
00:47:39.718 --> 00:47:41.956
but your brain's not quite
putting it together. huh?

696
00:47:42.091 --> 00:47:44.123
You let a little girl
get inside your head?

697
00:47:44.259 --> 00:47:46.092
You're not as smart
as you think you are.

698
00:47:46.228 --> 00:47:48.093
The girl. though.
she's fucking inspired.

699
00:47:48.229 --> 00:47:49.925
turning us
against each other like this.

700
00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.298
I believe her.

701
00:47:51.433 --> 00:47:52.932
Hmm.

702
00:47:53.068 --> 00:47:54.837
Well. I hate to say it.
but I think

703
00:47:54.972 --> 00:47:57.203
we're gonna have to get rough
with her.

704
00:48:00.772 --> 00:48:01.772
No.

705
00:48:01.907 --> 00:48:03.412
I'll do it.

706
00:48:04.641 --> 00:48:07.308
Don't take another
fucking step. Peter.

707
00:48:07.444 --> 00:48:09.777
It. uh... it's my job. Joey.

708
00:48:09.913 --> 00:48:11.820
Look. I just want to get to
the bottom of this. you know?

709
00:48:11.955 --> 00:48:13.955
My team is dropping
like flies. and...

710
00:48:14.090 --> 00:48:16.418
well. our guest
has besmirched my good name.

711
00:48:16.554 --> 00:48:19.896
and I take that
very personally. you know?

712
00:48:28.772 --> 00:48:30.836
Abigail?

713
00:48:30.971 --> 00:48:33.470
I'm very sorry. okay?

714
00:48:36.208 --> 00:48:37.810
Joey. what's happening?

715
00:48:37.946 --> 00:48:39.045
Just sorting something out.

716
00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:40.444
I'm just trying
to do my job. huh?

717
00:48:40.579 --> 00:48:42.247
Fucking put it down.
I'd really prefer not to

718
00:48:42.382 --> 00:48:44.412
- have to fucking shoot you.

719
00:48:44.547 --> 00:48:46.552
- What is he talking about?
- Get up.

720
00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:49.787
Frank.

721
00:48:49.922 --> 00:48:51.725
just shoot her.

722
00:48:51.861 --> 00:48:53.556
She's not gonna kill me.

723
00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.393
I might be wrong. Frank.

724
00:48:56.529 --> 00:48:58.166
- Joey. I'm scared.
- Fucking put it down.

725
00:48:58.301 --> 00:49:00.329
- I'm not fucking around here.
- You promised. Joey.

726
00:49:00.464 --> 00:49:01.903
I'm doing my best here. Abigail.

727
00:49:02.039 --> 00:49:03.168
Please point that
somewhere else.

728
00:49:03.304 --> 00:49:04.500
You're not touching that girl.

729
00:49:04.635 --> 00:49:06.270
-Okay.
-Put it the fuck down.

730
00:49:06.405 --> 00:49:07.777
Sammy.
little help would be nice.

731
00:49:07.912 --> 00:49:09.141
Don't pull Sammy into this.

732
00:49:09.276 --> 00:49:10.406
We need to know what she knows.

733
00:49:10.541 --> 00:49:12.347
Just let me
fucking talk to her.

734
00:49:12.483 --> 00:49:13.881
-No. no. no. no. no.
I'll talk to her.
-Peter.

735
00:49:14.017 --> 00:49:15.380
- Guys?
-You step the fuck back.

736
00:49:15.516 --> 00:49:18.318
Put it down. or you
can die right fucking now.

737
00:49:18.453 --> 00:49:19.883
-Guys. come on.
-Don't fucking try me!

738
00:49:20.019 --> 00:49:21.754
- Guys!
- Sammy!

739
00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:23.852
Sammy. shut the fuck up!

740
00:49:23.988 --> 00:49:25.988
What the fuck? How the fuck'd
she get out of those cuffs?

741
00:49:26.123 --> 00:49:27.359
Huh?

742
00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:33.033
- Holy fuck!
- Aah! Get her off of me!

743
00:49:33.168 --> 00:49:36.001
-Fuck!

744
00:49:39.504 --> 00:49:40.743
- Jesus fucking Christ.

745
00:49:40.878 --> 00:49:43.276
- Did-did she get me?
-Fuck.

746
00:49:43.943 --> 00:49:45.007
What the fuck?

747
00:49:49.384 --> 00:49:52.018
-Oh. fuck.
-Aah! No. no. no. no.

748
00:49:52.153 --> 00:49:54.584
- No fucking way!
- What the fuck?

749
00:50:13.174 --> 00:50:15.671
- What the fuck?

750
00:50:16.506 --> 00:50:18.542
What the fuck? What the fuck?

751
00:50:25.251 --> 00:50:26.348
We kidnapped a fucking vampire.

752
00:50:28.087 --> 00:50:29.488
A ballerina vampire.

753
00:50:29.623 --> 00:50:31.621
Someone has been messing
with us ever since we got here.

754
00:50:31.756 --> 00:50:34.263
Right? It's got to be. uh.
some kind of trick.

755
00:50:34.399 --> 00:50:36.060
I don't know anyone that could
pull off a trick like that.

756
00:50:36.195 --> 00:50:37.733
- Do you?
- I feel sick.

757
00:50:37.869 --> 00:50:39.363
At least Valdez isn't in here.

758
00:50:39.498 --> 00:50:41.869
The fucking girl is Valdez.
you moron.

759
00:50:42.004 --> 00:50:43.234
I thought her name was Abigail.

760
00:50:43.369 --> 00:50:45.040
She isn't... There isn't a...

761
00:50:45.176 --> 00:50:47.806
- Jesus fucking Christ.

762
00:50:50.915 --> 00:50:52.308
Shit.
We got to get out of here.

763
00:50:52.444 --> 00:50:53.541
There's got to be another way.

764
00:50:53.676 --> 00:50:55.216
No. I checked
all the other doors.

765
00:50:55.351 --> 00:50:56.611
These are some kind
of magnetically sealed locks.

766
00:50:56.747 --> 00:50:58.150
and these shutters
are two inches thick.

767
00:50:58.285 --> 00:51:00.120
You think
you can hack the locks?

768
00:51:00.256 --> 00:51:01.922
- With what Internet?
- I don't know.

769
00:51:02.058 --> 00:51:03.556
You-you can't do it manually?

770
00:51:03.692 --> 00:51:05.226
Well. even if I could.
I don't have any equipment.

771
00:51:05.362 --> 00:51:06.825
You know. there's got to be.
like. a control room

772
00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.062
or something.

773
00:51:08.197 --> 00:51:11.293
Okay. What do we know
about vampires?

774
00:51:11.429 --> 00:51:12.627
Th-That they're not real.

775
00:51:12.763 --> 00:51:14.200
What are we talking about.
like Anne Rice

776
00:51:14.336 --> 00:51:16.002
or <i>True Blood.</i>
you know. <i>Twilight?</i>

777
00:51:16.137 --> 00:51:17.873
Very different kind of vampires.

778
00:51:18.008 --> 00:51:19.172
Okay. we know
they feed off blood.

779
00:51:19.307 --> 00:51:20.437
We're really doing this
right now?

780
00:51:20.573 --> 00:51:21.708
They can turn other people
into vampires.

781
00:51:21.844 --> 00:51:23.112
Oh. Okay. fuck it.

782
00:51:23.247 --> 00:51:25.177
Um. they can turn into bats
and stuff like that.

783
00:51:25.313 --> 00:51:26.914
Mind control.
they make you do shit.

784
00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:28.144
They don't have a reflection.

785
00:51:28.279 --> 00:51:29.345
Not listening to this.

786
00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.712
Okay. how do we kill a vampire?

787
00:51:30.847 --> 00:51:32.381
-Garlic.
- A stake through the heart.

788
00:51:32.517 --> 00:51:33.715
- Crucifixes.
-Holy water.

789
00:51:33.850 --> 00:51:35.421
Oh. you're
a fucking priest now?

790
00:51:35.557 --> 00:51:37.291
- Daylight is a big one.
- Oh. that's a good one.

791
00:51:37.426 --> 00:51:39.391
but it's. mm. 3:30
in the fucking morning.

792
00:51:39.526 --> 00:51:42.296
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.
Shut the fuck up!

793
00:51:42.431 --> 00:51:45.298
Hey. dum-dum. we got
a real fucking situation here.

794
00:51:45.433 --> 00:51:47.428
So I don't give a shit
what you think.

795
00:51:47.564 --> 00:51:49.136
Either you're helping us.

796
00:51:49.272 --> 00:51:51.539
or you're 270 pounds
of dead weight.

797
00:51:51.675 --> 00:51:53.804
Which is it?

798
00:51:53.940 --> 00:51:56.277
Helping.

799
00:51:58.311 --> 00:52:00.512
Just don't do that again.

800
00:52:02.153 --> 00:52:03.412
There's pool cues
in the game room.

801
00:52:03.547 --> 00:52:05.484
Go sharpen 'em into stakes.

802
00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:09.356
Okay.

803
00:52:11.524 --> 00:52:13.593
You. go check the kitchen
for garlic.

804
00:52:13.729 --> 00:52:14.729
Alone?

805
00:52:14.864 --> 00:52:16.627
- Yes. alone.
- Yep.

806
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:19.935
What are you thinking?

807
00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:21.598
I say we tool up
and we kill her.

808
00:52:21.733 --> 00:52:23.265
That's a mistake.
You said it yourself.

809
00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:24.634
This girl is smart.

810
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:26.539
She's been manipulating us
from the start.

811
00:52:26.674 --> 00:52:28.809
We don't know if any
of this stuff is gonna work.

812
00:52:28.944 --> 00:52:30.278
And even if it does.

813
00:52:30.414 --> 00:52:32.207
killing her would be the
stupidest thing we could do.

814
00:52:32.342 --> 00:52:33.611
And why is that?

815
00:52:33.746 --> 00:52:35.080
Because we lose the only
bargaining chip we have.

816
00:52:35.215 --> 00:52:36.413
Well. what do you suggest?

817
00:52:36.549 --> 00:52:37.946
We trade her to Lazaar
for our lives.

818
00:52:38.081 --> 00:52:40.321
No. I'm not betting our lives
on your fucking hunch.

819
00:52:40.457 --> 00:52:41.650
I'm telling you.
she's gonna see you coming.

820
00:52:41.786 --> 00:52:44.560
No. Debate is over.
Decision made. Okay?

821
00:52:44.695 --> 00:52:46.356
I got 'em!

822
00:52:46.491 --> 00:52:48.993
Sammy. those are fucking onions.

823
00:52:49.128 --> 00:52:50.592
Well...

824
00:52:50.727 --> 00:52:52.598
I don't cook. I don't know.

825
00:52:52.734 --> 00:52:57.000
All right. let's go kill us
a fuckin'... vampire.

826
00:52:57.135 --> 00:52:58.670
Good luck.

827
00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.839
Oh. I'm not going.
I already told you why.

828
00:53:01.974 --> 00:53:05.577
And if you put your hand
around my neck. you'll lose it.

829
00:53:05.712 --> 00:53:07.711
I'm not gonna touch you.
Go put your feet up.

830
00:53:07.846 --> 00:53:10.311
You two. on me.
Let's hit the kitchen first.

831
00:53:10.446 --> 00:53:12.617
Fucking onions.

832
00:53:25.594 --> 00:53:27.401
Fuck.

833
00:53:39.245 --> 00:53:40.810
Let's fucking go.

834
00:53:44.282 --> 00:53:45.650
What the fuck?

835
00:54:50.921 --> 00:54:52.614
What's happening?

836
00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:55.255
Let's... let's just talk.

837
00:54:58.822 --> 00:55:00.662
-Fuck!
-Holy shit!

838
00:55:06.169 --> 00:55:08.264
Fucking help me. you fuckers!

839
00:55:52.046 --> 00:55:54.112
Oh. fuck!

840
00:55:54.248 --> 00:55:56.812
Oh! Oh! Oh! Jesus!

841
00:55:56.948 --> 00:55:59.853
- Oh. Christ!

842
00:56:01.084 --> 00:56:03.253
You're so bloody and so gross.

843
00:56:09.226 --> 00:56:13.097
Ah. Jesus. Mary and
motherfucking son of a bitch!

844
00:56:13.232 --> 00:56:15.936
Oh. fuck!

845
00:56:18.508 --> 00:56:21.435
Oh. if you fucking say.
"I told you so."

846
00:56:24.375 --> 00:56:25.711
Oh. shit.

847
00:56:25.846 --> 00:56:27.244
Wait. wait. wait. wait. wait.
wait. wait. wait.

848
00:56:27.380 --> 00:56:29.716
Oh! Motherfucker!

849
00:56:29.851 --> 00:56:32.050
- Why didn't she kill you?
- She is fucking with us.

850
00:56:32.185 --> 00:56:33.586
Oh. fuck!

851
00:56:33.722 --> 00:56:35.521
I'm guessing
none of those weapons worked.

852
00:56:35.657 --> 00:56:37.591
Well. the stake worked
on my fucking leg.

853
00:56:37.726 --> 00:56:39.723
and she used the crucifix
on Peter like a fucking

854
00:56:39.859 --> 00:56:42.561
pincushion.
and the garlic did fuck all!

855
00:56:42.697 --> 00:56:44.426
- Shh. Shh.
-Well. I have one thing

856
00:56:44.562 --> 00:56:46.632
we know does work.

857
00:56:46.768 --> 00:56:49.866
When I jabbed her with this.
she was out. out.

858
00:56:50.002 --> 00:56:51.900
If we can corner her.
it's nighty-night.

859
00:56:52.035 --> 00:56:53.503
The Sleeping Beauty act
was bullshit.

860
00:56:53.639 --> 00:56:55.108
No. it wasn't.

861
00:56:55.243 --> 00:56:56.476
I checked her pulse.

862
00:56:56.611 --> 00:56:59.110
and her breathing was slow
and steady.

863
00:56:59.246 --> 00:57:00.746
We split up.

864
00:57:00.882 --> 00:57:02.976
Whoever finds her first
alerts me through the comms.

865
00:57:03.112 --> 00:57:04.649
and I come running
with the syringe.

866
00:57:04.785 --> 00:57:05.947
That's great that you're

867
00:57:06.082 --> 00:57:07.687
the only one
with a weapon that works.

868
00:57:07.822 --> 00:57:10.857
Listen. you sit here and bleed.
or you trust me.

869
00:57:10.993 --> 00:57:12.793
Yeah.

870
00:57:12.929 --> 00:57:14.188
Sammy?

871
00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:16.861
Okay.

872
00:57:18.836 --> 00:57:20.469
Fuck.

873
00:57:39.786 --> 00:57:41.721
-Check in.

874
00:57:42.922 --> 00:57:44.920
All's clear on the east side.

875
00:57:45.055 --> 00:57:48.057
-Nothing on two... yet.

876
00:57:48.192 --> 00:57:50.499
PETER
There's no vampires here.

877
00:57:51.665 --> 00:57:53.800
Not that I'm actually looking.

878
00:57:53.936 --> 00:57:55.901
Channel's
still open. dick face.

879
00:57:56.036 --> 00:57:59.434
Put that fucking bottle down
and fucking do something.

880
00:58:01.442 --> 00:58:02.906
Can she turn into a rat?

881
00:58:03.041 --> 00:58:04.739
'Cause I might be looking
right at her.

882
00:58:04.875 --> 00:58:07.080
Maybe she can join the pack.

883
00:58:07.216 --> 00:58:08.712
Oh. now I get it.

884
00:58:08.847 --> 00:58:10.547
I get the...
I get the name now.

885
00:58:10.683 --> 00:58:12.416
I get it. The Rat Pack. right?

886
00:58:12.551 --> 00:58:13.817
Yeah.

887
00:58:13.952 --> 00:58:16.085
PETER
That's funny.

888
00:58:37.047 --> 00:58:38.606
Fuck! Fuck.

889
00:58:39.911 --> 00:58:42.448
Sammy. your comms
are cutting out.

890
00:58:42.583 --> 00:58:45.620
Sammy. Sammy?

891
00:58:55.894 --> 00:58:58.430
-  Fuck!

892
00:59:14.078 --> 00:59:15.710
- What is it?

893
00:59:15.845 --> 00:59:17.481
There's bodies!

894
00:59:17.616 --> 00:59:19.953
Bodies in the pool!

895
00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:21.889
What?

896
00:59:22.025 --> 00:59:23.386
Shit.

897
00:59:26.996 --> 00:59:27.995
No!

898
00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.466
Huh.

899
00:59:38.837 --> 00:59:40.606
- Peter!

900
00:59:40.741 --> 00:59:43.675
I got a splinter...
on my finger.

901
00:59:43.810 --> 00:59:46.209
A huge one
from the stupid stick.

902
00:59:46.345 --> 00:59:49.112
A little more concerned with
the bodies in the pool. Peter.

903
00:59:49.247 --> 00:59:51.151
FRANK
How many bodies we talking?

904
00:59:51.287 --> 00:59:52.654
Like. two. three?

905
01:00:03.299 --> 01:00:05.628
Oh. shit. Oh. shit.

906
01:00:10.539 --> 01:00:12.236
Peter. stop fucking around.

907
01:00:13.573 --> 01:00:16.043
Vampire on my ass!

908
01:00:19.016 --> 01:00:21.177
Vampire!

909
01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:23.818
Take that.

910
01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:28.151
All right. I got her trapped
in the upstairs hallway. so...

911
01:00:29.853 --> 01:00:31.222
Holy fuck! Vam...

912
01:00:31.358 --> 01:00:32.892
Vampire!

913
01:00:42.098 --> 01:00:44.370
- Oh...

914
01:00:44.505 --> 01:00:47.406
Oh. shit.

915
01:01:12.933 --> 01:01:15.935
- Ugh. What the fuck?
- I'm here.

916
01:01:20.408 --> 01:01:22.076
Oh. shit. Shit.

917
01:01:37.954 --> 01:01:40.424
Oh. fuck.

918
01:01:40.559 --> 01:01:42.995
Oh. shit.

919
01:01:49.902 --> 01:01:53.605
What color are my eyes. Frank?

920
01:01:57.843 --> 01:01:59.444
FRANK
Sammy?

921
01:01:59.579 --> 01:02:01.413
Sammy. help me!

922
01:02:01.548 --> 01:02:04.015
Sammy. Sammy.

923
01:02:04.150 --> 01:02:06.651
- Sammy. help me. Sammy.

924
01:02:06.787 --> 01:02:09.417
- Sammy. help.

925
01:02:20.935 --> 01:02:24.003
-Oh. come on.

926
01:02:25.203 --> 01:02:27.969
Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.
What the fuck?

927
01:02:28.104 --> 01:02:30.011
She's fucking flying!

928
01:02:31.209 --> 01:02:34.343
- Fuck! What the fuck?!

929
01:02:46.088 --> 01:02:49.193
- Joey!

930
01:02:50.163 --> 01:02:52.300
I can't hold her much longer.
Come on!

931
01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:53.866
Do it now. Come on!

932
01:02:54.002 --> 01:02:56.096
Joey!
Jesus fucking Christ. come on!

933
01:02:56.232 --> 01:02:59.203
Joey? Joey?

934
01:03:01.005 --> 01:03:04.142
Fucking bitch!

935
01:03:05.274 --> 01:03:07.175
I'll kill you fucking fucks!

936
01:03:07.310 --> 01:03:10.012
I'll rip your fucking heads off

937
01:03:10.147 --> 01:03:12.617
and gorge myself on your blood!

938
01:03:37.072 --> 01:03:38.805
Yeah?

939
01:03:38.941 --> 01:03:40.543
Oh. yes.

940
01:03:48.456 --> 01:03:50.188
Sammy?

941
01:03:51.125 --> 01:03:53.895
What the fuck's gonna
happen to me?

942
01:03:55.794 --> 01:03:56.996
How do you feel?

943
01:03:57.131 --> 01:03:59.628
I feel like I got bit
by a fucking vampire.

944
01:04:01.201 --> 01:04:04.567
What the fuck is gonna
happen to me?! Huh?!

945
01:04:05.169 --> 01:04:07.238
What's gonna happen to me?

946
01:04:08.808 --> 01:04:10.472
I don't know.

947
01:04:14.878 --> 01:04:16.577
Yeah.

948
01:04:42.577 --> 01:04:44.605
We want to talk.

949
01:04:47.650 --> 01:04:50.746
Please. please let me out.

950
01:04:52.147 --> 01:04:54.289
I'm scared.

951
01:04:54.424 --> 01:04:55.818
Cut the shit.

952
01:04:57.788 --> 01:05:00.360
You're really good at
pretending to be a little girl.

953
01:05:00.495 --> 01:05:01.523
Thank you.

954
01:05:02.933 --> 01:05:05.094
I've had a few centuries
of experience.

955
01:05:05.229 --> 01:05:07.733
Tell us how to get out of here.

956
01:05:07.868 --> 01:05:09.500
and we'll let you go.

957
01:05:09.635 --> 01:05:11.002
No.

958
01:05:11.137 --> 01:05:13.238
Hey. what's gonna happen to me?

959
01:05:14.403 --> 01:05:16.639
Am I gonna turn into a vampire?

960
01:05:16.775 --> 01:05:18.408
Maybe.

961
01:05:19.979 --> 01:05:22.244
Oh. my God. Oh. my God!

962
01:05:22.379 --> 01:05:23.848
- She said maybe!
- It's okay.

963
01:05:23.984 --> 01:05:25.849
Listen. little lady.

964
01:05:25.985 --> 01:05:28.886
or ma'am. whatever.

965
01:05:29.022 --> 01:05:30.724
We're very sorry. okay?

966
01:05:30.859 --> 01:05:32.224
We didn't know who you were.

967
01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.729
We thought you were just
a regular 12-year-old girl.

968
01:05:34.865 --> 01:05:38.297
You were gonna beat me
and torture me

969
01:05:38.432 --> 01:05:42.029
when you thought I was just
a regular 12-year-old girl.

970
01:05:42.164 --> 01:05:44.298
Yeah. well...

971
01:05:44.434 --> 01:05:46.339
Like I say. we're very sorry.

972
01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:49.404
We would never have taken you
if we knew who your father was.

973
01:05:49.539 --> 01:05:52.376
You did work for him.
didn't you?

974
01:05:54.679 --> 01:05:58.420
Haven't you wondered
why I brought you all here?

975
01:05:58.555 --> 01:05:59.849
You brought us here?

976
01:05:59.984 --> 01:06:01.248
Jesus Christ.

977
01:06:01.383 --> 01:06:03.755
There was never any money.

978
01:06:03.890 --> 01:06:05.988
I planned all of this.

979
01:06:06.123 --> 01:06:08.657
Lambert works for me.

980
01:06:09.827 --> 01:06:14.068
- What are you talking about?
- Don't you know. Jessie?

981
01:06:17.135 --> 01:06:18.703
What did you just call me?

982
01:06:18.838 --> 01:06:20.039
Jessica Hurney.

983
01:06:20.175 --> 01:06:23.175
You started your career
siphoning money

984
01:06:23.311 --> 01:06:25.711
from your affluent parents'
bank accounts.

985
01:06:25.846 --> 01:06:27.715
Hedge funds came next.

986
01:06:27.850 --> 01:06:30.081
then private offshore accounts.

987
01:06:30.216 --> 01:06:33.652
and eventually.
much bigger fish.

988
01:06:33.788 --> 01:06:36.018
One in particular.

989
01:06:36.153 --> 01:06:37.858
I can give it back.

990
01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:41.258
Terrence Lacroix.

991
01:06:41.394 --> 01:06:44.492
Muscle for the Montreal
Broussard family.

992
01:06:44.628 --> 01:06:48.068
Did it bore you.
snapping necks for pay?

993
01:06:48.203 --> 01:06:51.133
Enduring endless taunts
from your colleagues

994
01:06:51.269 --> 01:06:53.270
about your stunted intellect?

995
01:06:53.405 --> 01:06:55.341
Is that why you stole
from your crew.

996
01:06:55.476 --> 01:06:59.947
who just happened to be a
tiny subsidiary of our empire?

997
01:07:00.082 --> 01:07:02.814
How long did the money last.
you weak.

998
01:07:02.949 --> 01:07:06.153
disloyal inebriate?

999
01:07:08.825 --> 01:07:13.457
Former Detective Adam Barrett.

1000
01:07:13.592 --> 01:07:17.465
You thought you could
infiltrate our New York arm

1001
01:07:17.601 --> 01:07:18.793
under deep cover.

1002
01:07:18.928 --> 01:07:21.632
But you liked the life
a little too much. didn't you?

1003
01:07:21.768 --> 01:07:27.537
The power you had when you were
free of rules and regulations.

1004
01:07:28.404 --> 01:07:30.303
It became an addiction.

1005
01:07:30.438 --> 01:07:32.509
How empty did you feel

1006
01:07:32.644 --> 01:07:35.983
when you finally arrested
our three lieutenants

1007
01:07:36.119 --> 01:07:39.649
you'd worked so hard
to get close to?

1008
01:07:39.784 --> 01:07:44.288
And how empty did you feel
after I ripped up their bodies

1009
01:07:44.423 --> 01:07:46.759
in the hotel penthouse
because of you?

1010
01:07:46.894 --> 01:07:48.723
You changed your name.

1011
01:07:48.858 --> 01:07:52.462
you left town. and you never
saw your family again.

1012
01:07:52.597 --> 01:07:55.602
But it wasn't
for their safety. was it.

1013
01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:58.271
Detective Barrett?

1014
01:08:00.371 --> 01:08:05.007
Finally. we have the tragic

1015
01:08:05.142 --> 01:08:06.948
Ana Lucia Cruz.

1016
01:08:07.084 --> 01:08:09.544
Former Army medic
drummed out of service

1017
01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.412
for shooting up
Uncle Sam's morphine.

1018
01:08:12.548 --> 01:08:14.119
I was injured in the field.

1019
01:08:14.255 --> 01:08:17.092
You tried
to take care of your son.

1020
01:08:17.227 --> 01:08:20.020
before abandoning him
to his fuckup of a father.

1021
01:08:20.156 --> 01:08:21.191
Shut up.

1022
01:08:21.326 --> 01:08:22.763
You became an underground doctor

1023
01:08:22.899 --> 01:08:24.231
for some very shady people.

1024
01:08:24.366 --> 01:08:27.165
But one day. you were just
too high to do your job.

1025
01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:29.230
and instead
of removing a bullet.

1026
01:08:29.365 --> 01:08:30.932
you nicked an artery.

1027
01:08:31.068 --> 01:08:34.935
and someone very important to
my father's business bled out.

1028
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:40.046
But you and Detective Barrett
have something in common.

1029
01:08:40.181 --> 01:08:42.880
You never went back
for your son.

1030
01:08:43.016 --> 01:08:45.285
Shut the fuck up!

1031
01:08:46.352 --> 01:08:49.620
And what do you tell yourself. huh?

1032
01:08:49.755 --> 01:08:53.161
That you want to be your
daddy's little errand girl?

1033
01:08:54.095 --> 01:08:56.763
No. he did lose interest in you.

1034
01:08:56.898 --> 01:08:59.093
That wasn't a lie.

1035
01:08:59.962 --> 01:09:01.764
How many of your father's
enemies do you think

1036
01:09:01.899 --> 01:09:05.668
you're gonna have to kill
until he loves you again?

1037
01:09:06.938 --> 01:09:08.968
If this is about revenge.
why didn't you just kill us?

1038
01:09:09.104 --> 01:09:12.245
- Why'd you bring us here?
- Because it isn't.

1039
01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:14.382
- This is just a game to her.
-Bullshit.

1040
01:09:14.517 --> 01:09:18.050
She was screaming at the house.
and Dad triggered the alarm.

1041
01:09:18.185 --> 01:09:21.216
That wasn't even her father.

1042
01:09:21.352 --> 01:09:22.850
That wasn't Lazaar.

1043
01:09:22.985 --> 01:09:26.124
And for what.
because you're fucking bored?

1044
01:09:26.259 --> 01:09:28.563
For your fucking entertainment?

1045
01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:30.759
What can I say?

1046
01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:34.100
I like playing with my food.

1047
01:09:34.235 --> 01:09:35.830
You're the same as all the other

1048
01:09:35.965 --> 01:09:38.038
meat sacks I've brought here
over the years.

1049
01:09:38.174 --> 01:09:40.234
Nothing different
about any of you.

1050
01:09:40.369 --> 01:09:41.801
Nothing special.

1051
01:09:41.937 --> 01:09:44.108
Just something
to help me pass the time.

1052
01:09:44.243 --> 01:09:46.214
Quick question.

1053
01:09:48.018 --> 01:09:51.285
Who's inside a cage right now?

1054
01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:55.322
If you let me out.
I'll let two of you live.

1055
01:09:55.956 --> 01:09:57.458
Oh. Which two?

1056
01:09:57.594 --> 01:09:58.521
What?

1057
01:09:58.657 --> 01:10:00.157
- It's a surprise.
-Fuck this.

1058
01:10:00.293 --> 01:10:01.762
Let's just kill her now.

1059
01:10:01.897 --> 01:10:03.261
You tried that. Frank.

1060
01:10:03.397 --> 01:10:05.162
If you would like
to open this door

1061
01:10:05.297 --> 01:10:07.400
and try again. please do.

1062
01:10:08.167 --> 01:10:09.532
My offer just expired.

1063
01:10:09.668 --> 01:10:11.673
Now I'll only let
one of you live--

1064
01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:13.835
whoever lets me out.

1065
01:10:17.376 --> 01:10:18.808
She's fucking lying. moron.

1066
01:10:18.944 --> 01:10:21.376
You touch that door. you're
as dead as the rest of us.

1067
01:10:21.512 --> 01:10:23.015
Maybe it's worth a try.

1068
01:10:23.151 --> 01:10:24.313
We have her. Peter.

1069
01:10:24.449 --> 01:10:25.481
That's why we did this--

1070
01:10:25.616 --> 01:10:26.886
so we can trade her
for our lives.

1071
01:10:27.022 --> 01:10:28.854
That will never happen.

1072
01:10:28.989 --> 01:10:30.024
Joey was right.

1073
01:10:30.159 --> 01:10:32.090
No matter how many of you
I kill.

1074
01:10:32.226 --> 01:10:33.821
my father doesn't love me.

1075
01:10:33.957 --> 01:10:36.391
and he's not gonna trade
anything for me.

1076
01:10:36.527 --> 01:10:39.897
So go on. Peter. let me out.

1077
01:10:41.836 --> 01:10:42.897
Go on.

1078
01:10:43.032 --> 01:10:45.438
Peter. if you touch that door.
I will shoot you.

1079
01:10:47.206 --> 01:10:49.244
I'm sorry. guys.

1080
01:10:57.013 --> 01:10:59.615
- Aah! You shot me! You shot me!

1081
01:10:59.751 --> 01:11:01.184
I barely grazed you.
Now give me your gun

1082
01:11:01.319 --> 01:11:02.218
so I can patch you up.

1083
01:11:02.353 --> 01:11:04.055
You're sure crazy.

1084
01:11:04.190 --> 01:11:05.456
I prefer "impatient."

1085
01:11:05.591 --> 01:11:07.358
Frank. help me out.
Sammy. watch her.

1086
01:11:07.493 --> 01:11:10.362
Fuck that shit. Mm-mm.

1087
01:11:10.498 --> 01:11:13.326
- Sammy.
- I'm not staying down here...

1088
01:11:13.461 --> 01:11:15.066
with that.

1089
01:11:15.201 --> 01:11:17.371
Fuck that shit. Joey.

1090
01:11:18.071 --> 01:11:20.308
I got this.

1091
01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:23.542
Fine.

1092
01:11:27.381 --> 01:11:29.446
-Ow.
-You okay?

1093
01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:31.247
Getting shot hurts. Sammy.

1094
01:11:31.382 --> 01:11:33.281
Oh. fuck.

1095
01:11:36.653 --> 01:11:38.624
The offer still stands. Frank.

1096
01:11:38.759 --> 01:11:41.290
Open the door. and I'll let you
keep all your blood.

1097
01:11:41.425 --> 01:11:43.795
- Oh.
- Organs. too.

1098
01:11:43.931 --> 01:11:44.957
Sure.

1099
01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:48.200
I'm serious.
You could be useful to us.

1100
01:11:48.335 --> 01:11:52.501
Why don't you... tell me...

1101
01:11:52.636 --> 01:11:55.910
how to get the fuck out of here.

1102
01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:57.674
and I'll consider it.

1103
01:11:57.809 --> 01:12:00.747
If I told you.
you'd just leave me here.

1104
01:12:00.882 --> 01:12:02.845
You first.

1105
01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:05.914
You know what?

1106
01:12:09.222 --> 01:12:10.985
My offer just expired.

1107
01:12:12.187 --> 01:12:15.257
Have fun spending eternity
in a fucking elevator.

1108
01:12:15.393 --> 01:12:16.995
Wait.

1109
01:12:17.131 --> 01:12:19.334
I'll tell you.

1110
01:12:20.569 --> 01:12:24.471
But you have to let me out
immediately after I do.

1111
01:12:29.174 --> 01:12:30.336
All right.

1112
01:12:30.472 --> 01:12:32.512
Fine.

1113
01:12:34.181 --> 01:12:36.844
It's a deal.

1114
01:12:36.980 --> 01:12:39.020
There's a secret door
in the library.

1115
01:12:39.155 --> 01:12:41.923
The bookshelf on the right wall.

1116
01:12:42.058 --> 01:12:44.425
<i>And Then There Were None.</i>

1117
01:12:45.123 --> 01:12:46.757
Hmm.

1118
01:12:48.292 --> 01:12:50.123
Very good.

1119
01:12:51.867 --> 01:12:53.260
Thanks.

1120
01:12:53.396 --> 01:12:54.594
Wait.

1121
01:12:54.729 --> 01:12:56.297
A deal's a deal.

1122
01:12:56.432 --> 01:12:58.736
Oh. right.

1123
01:13:00.207 --> 01:13:02.608
The deal.

1124
01:13:03.838 --> 01:13:06.909
Ain't I a Silly Billy?

1125
01:13:23.765 --> 01:13:28.066
Still gullible at your age.
you fucking freak?

1126
01:13:31.873 --> 01:13:35.740
- What's so fucking funny?

1127
01:14:21.554 --> 01:14:23.352
- The library.
- Oh. shit.

1128
01:14:23.488 --> 01:14:26.527
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1129
01:15:08.032 --> 01:15:10.267
You looking
for some light reading. Frank?

1130
01:15:10.403 --> 01:15:12.870
Shut the fuck up.

1131
01:15:20.447 --> 01:15:23.848
<i>And Then There Were None.</i>

1132
01:15:36.364 --> 01:15:38.230
Agatha fucking Christie.

1133
01:15:38.366 --> 01:15:40.562
You fucking playing me?

1134
01:15:40.698 --> 01:15:41.964
Fucking ballerina fuck.

1135
01:15:42.099 --> 01:15:46.035
Stupid fucking dancing
fucking vampire fuck!

1136
01:15:47.373 --> 01:15:48.536
Fuck! Fuck!

1137
01:15:51.574 --> 01:15:52.979
You good?

1138
01:15:54.777 --> 01:15:56.380
So what the fuck now?

1139
01:15:56.516 --> 01:15:57.710
She was already healing.

1140
01:15:57.845 --> 01:15:59.147
You saw it. too.

1141
01:16:00.817 --> 01:16:01.989
Keep an eye on the door.

1142
01:16:02.125 --> 01:16:03.217
Stay in the light.

1143
01:16:16.765 --> 01:16:18.604
Grab something.

1144
01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:21.301
We're gonna break
through this wall.

1145
01:16:28.582 --> 01:16:31.515
Will you fucking stop already?

1146
01:16:31.651 --> 01:16:33.115
She's not going anywhere.

1147
01:16:33.250 --> 01:16:36.221
She's waiting for it
to get dark. and then...

1148
01:16:36.357 --> 01:16:37.352
we're fucked!

1149
01:16:37.488 --> 01:16:38.387
Fuck!

1150
01:16:42.256 --> 01:16:44.126
- Goddamn it.

1151
01:16:52.904 --> 01:16:55.302
Aw. You run out of candy?

1152
01:17:06.551 --> 01:17:07.754
I'm scared.

1153
01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:20.267
Was that true?

1154
01:17:20.403 --> 01:17:22.934
What she said about your son?

1155
01:17:23.734 --> 01:17:25.673
That you left him?

1156
01:17:29.003 --> 01:17:30.370
Yeah.

1157
01:17:31.576 --> 01:17:33.780
But I got clean.

1158
01:17:34.714 --> 01:17:36.249
And I was gonna go back for him.

1159
01:17:36.384 --> 01:17:38.448
That was...

1160
01:17:38.584 --> 01:17:40.285
That is the plan.

1161
01:17:40.421 --> 01:17:41.488
That's good.

1162
01:17:41.624 --> 01:17:43.455
How often do you get
to talk to him?

1163
01:17:43.591 --> 01:17:44.784
Tried calling him.

1164
01:17:44.919 --> 01:17:46.991
I just. um...

1165
01:17:49.730 --> 01:17:51.864
I can't do it.

1166
01:17:52.732 --> 01:17:53.931
That's why I took this job.

1167
01:17:54.066 --> 01:17:58.334
With that money.
I can start over. you know?

1168
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:59.832
A reset.

1169
01:17:59.968 --> 01:18:01.570
Boo-hoo.

1170
01:18:01.706 --> 01:18:03.404
Fucking bullshit.

1171
01:18:03.539 --> 01:18:05.138
It's not about the money.
The money's an excuse.

1172
01:18:05.273 --> 01:18:06.980
You didn't go back for your kid

1173
01:18:07.116 --> 01:18:08.475
'cause you're scared of being
a piece-of-shit mother.

1174
01:18:08.610 --> 01:18:10.914
God. everybody's got to be
a fucking victim now.

1175
01:18:11.050 --> 01:18:12.345
"Oh. I left
'cause I was on drugs."

1176
01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:14.118
"Oh. I was on drugs
'cause I got hurt."

1177
01:18:14.253 --> 01:18:16.988
Own your fucking shit and go
and be a mother to that kid.

1178
01:18:18.123 --> 01:18:21.729
Oh. I'm sorry.
Did I hit a fucking nerve?

1179
01:18:25.662 --> 01:18:27.067
Reset.

1180
01:18:27.203 --> 01:18:28.667
Oh. my God.

1181
01:18:28.802 --> 01:18:30.504
I don't need to hack the locks.

1182
01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:32.198
I just need
to find a power source.

1183
01:18:32.334 --> 01:18:33.967
And if I can find
the power source.

1184
01:18:34.102 --> 01:18:36.204
then we can just short it.

1185
01:18:36.339 --> 01:18:37.973
What. are you gonna unplug
the fucking house?

1186
01:18:38.108 --> 01:18:39.541
Okay. we search the house.

1187
01:18:39.676 --> 01:18:40.812
Two teams.

1188
01:18:40.948 --> 01:18:42.682
And we don't stop
until we find it.

1189
01:18:42.818 --> 01:18:44.814
Well. who's going
with Twilight here?

1190
01:18:44.949 --> 01:18:46.653
I'll go with you.

1191
01:18:46.789 --> 01:18:51.652
I. uh. saw your reflection
in this earlier.

1192
01:18:51.788 --> 01:18:53.787
Oh. my God.

1193
01:18:53.922 --> 01:18:55.326
Let's go.

1194
01:18:57.096 --> 01:18:59.197
-Fuck this job.
- Fucking dream team.

1195
01:19:07.641 --> 01:19:09.409
Oh. no. no. Stay close.

1196
01:19:09.545 --> 01:19:11.140
- I got you.

1197
01:19:11.275 --> 01:19:12.708
FRANK
Not seeing anything yet.

1198
01:19:12.843 --> 01:19:14.281
What about you guys?

1199
01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:15.843
Eh. nothing.

1200
01:19:15.978 --> 01:19:17.351
Stay alert.

1201
01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:19.380
She's toying with us.

1202
01:19:27.828 --> 01:19:29.091
There's nothing here.

1203
01:19:29.227 --> 01:19:31.626
You got any other bright ideas.
Nosferatu?

1204
01:19:31.762 --> 01:19:32.828
Goddamn it.

1205
01:19:32.964 --> 01:19:34.902
Why did you all listen to me?

1206
01:19:35.037 --> 01:19:37.601
This isn't gonna work.
This is so fucking stupid.

1207
01:19:37.736 --> 01:19:39.140
- Sammy.

1208
01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:41.369
Listen to me.

1209
01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:46.011
You got people out there
that you care about?

1210
01:19:47.108 --> 01:19:49.047
- Hmm?

1211
01:19:49.680 --> 01:19:51.379
Sammy.

1212
01:19:52.047 --> 01:19:53.780
I have people. too.

1213
01:19:55.753 --> 01:19:56.987
So. you and me.

1214
01:19:57.123 --> 01:19:58.989
we're gonna go find
that power source.

1215
01:19:59.125 --> 01:20:00.690
We're gonna get
the fuck out of here.

1216
01:20:00.826 --> 01:20:03.361
- You think so?
- Yes.

1217
01:20:03.497 --> 01:20:05.228
You and me.

1218
01:20:05.929 --> 01:20:07.868

Sammy?

1267
01:23:30.838 --> 01:23:31.965
He's dead.

1268
01:23:32.101 --> 01:23:34.173
She got him.

1269
01:23:34.806 --> 01:23:37.271
Oh. no.

1270
01:23:37.406 --> 01:23:40.047
-What happened?
- Shh.

1271
01:23:42.685 --> 01:23:44.744
She's still in here.

1272
01:23:48.216 --> 01:23:50.057
Come over here.

1273
01:23:52.054 --> 01:23:53.555
Fine.

1274
01:23:57.226 --> 01:23:58.529
Run.

1275
01:23:58.665 --> 01:24:00.100
What?

1276
01:24:03.233 --> 01:24:04.898
- Run.

1277
01:24:05.034 --> 01:24:06.637
Fuck.

1278
01:24:16.311 --> 01:24:18.184
Here. Here.

1279
01:24:28.226 --> 01:24:30.730
I've always hated this room.

1280
01:24:30.866 --> 01:24:32.759
My father turned me in here.

1281
01:24:33.769 --> 01:24:36.336
Lot of painful memories.

1282
01:24:39.175 --> 01:24:42.307
But it's never too late
to make new ones.

1283
01:24:53.518 --> 01:24:56.821
-  Holy shit.

1284
01:24:56.956 --> 01:24:58.985
That was fucking...

1285
01:24:59.121 --> 01:25:00.056
Whoa.

1286
01:25:06.862 --> 01:25:09.999
Now what do we do
about the real fucking problem?

1287
01:25:18.111 --> 01:25:20.774
- Well. that's a...
- Trap?

1288
01:25:22.710 --> 01:25:24.811
What the fuck else
are we gonna do?

1289
01:25:50.938 --> 01:25:52.343
DEAN
<i>I'm the best</i>

1290
01:25:52.478 --> 01:25:53.974
<i>motherfucking wheelman
in this town.</i>

1291
01:25:54.110 --> 01:25:55.676
JOEY
<i>I didn't say you weren't good.</i>

1292
01:25:55.812 --> 01:25:57.778
<i>I said you're not
a professional.</i>

1293
01:25:59.548 --> 01:26:02.019
<i>You've got loose wiring.</i>

1294
01:26:02.154 --> 01:26:04.483
<i>Probably a sociopath.</i>

1295
01:26:06.625 --> 01:26:09.460
FRANK
<i>And you are a junkie.</i>

1296
01:26:13.231 --> 01:26:15.296
<i>Cop knows a junkie.</i>

1297
01:26:15.432 --> 01:26:19.166
<i>Your little candy affectation.</i>

1298
01:26:19.302 --> 01:26:21.067
<i>Long sleeves.</i>

1299
01:26:21.202 --> 01:26:23.705
<i>The way you don't want to
have a drink with us.</i>

1300
01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:25.705
<i>You in recovery or something?</i>

1301
01:26:25.841 --> 01:26:27.880
What the fuck.
you backstabbing son of a...

1302
01:26:28.015 --> 01:26:29.512
- Oh. fuck!

1303
01:26:29.648 --> 01:26:31.046
You're one of them!
He's one of them!

1304
01:26:31.181 --> 01:26:32.349
No shit. Frank.

1305
01:26:32.485 --> 01:26:33.813
What the fuck is happening. motherfucker?

1306
01:26:33.948 --> 01:26:36.353
I brought you back here
to offer you a deal.

1307
01:26:36.489 --> 01:26:38.217
We're not taking
any fucking deals.

1308
01:26:40.259 --> 01:26:42.658
I wasn't talking to you.

1309
01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:44.957
Shit.

1310
01:26:49.464 --> 01:26:51.267
You fucking set me up.

1311
01:26:51.402 --> 01:26:53.799
Abigail turned me two years ago.

1312
01:26:53.935 --> 01:26:56.241
She found out
I helped you in New York.

1313
01:26:56.377 --> 01:26:59.345
She came for me
and threatened my family.

1314
01:26:59.481 --> 01:27:03.348
Now all I do is bring
her father's enemies here

1315
01:27:03.483 --> 01:27:06.180
so that she can play
her little hunting game.

1316
01:27:06.315 --> 01:27:09.252
But I am done.

1317
01:27:09.387 --> 01:27:11.119
What's your fucking point?

1318
01:27:11.255 --> 01:27:13.157
You can die here.

1319
01:27:13.292 --> 01:27:16.322
or you can help me kill Abigail.

1320
01:27:16.458 --> 01:27:17.923
Help me take her.

1321
01:27:18.058 --> 01:27:21.730
and you can have anything
you fucking want.

1322
01:27:23.271 --> 01:27:24.601
But you'll need
a little upgrade.

1323
01:27:24.737 --> 01:27:26.805
I'm not gonna become
a fucking puppet like Sammy.

1324
01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:29.073
- Fuck no.
- No.

1325
01:27:29.208 --> 01:27:30.439
You'd be just like me.

1326
01:27:30.575 --> 01:27:32.371
You'd get the complete
treatment.

1327
01:27:32.506 --> 01:27:34.745
Total autonomy.

1328
01:27:34.881 --> 01:27:36.008
Frank.

1329
01:27:36.144 --> 01:27:37.212
I've told Lazaar
there's a problem.

1330
01:27:37.347 --> 01:27:38.715
He's on his way.

1331
01:27:38.850 --> 01:27:40.980
We'll kill the girl.
we'll kill her father.

1332
01:27:41.115 --> 01:27:44.588
and we'll take over
the whole fucking thing.

1333
01:27:47.191 --> 01:27:49.725
Frank. Please...

1334
01:27:51.832 --> 01:27:52.858
Fuck it.

1335
01:27:52.993 --> 01:27:56.303
- Bite me.

1336
01:28:12.215 --> 01:28:14.354
Fuck!

1337
01:28:22.929 --> 01:28:23.856
Drink.

1338
01:28:23.992 --> 01:28:27.862
Yes. drink.
and you'll be one of us.

1339
01:28:31.332 --> 01:28:32.572
Yes.

1340
01:28:34.071 --> 01:28:35.639
Yes.

1341
01:29:22.856 --> 01:29:23.583
Oh.

1342
01:29:23.718 --> 01:29:26.021
You're still with us.

1343
01:29:26.157 --> 01:29:28.389
Frank.

1344
01:29:28.525 --> 01:29:30.664
meet your first victim.

1345
01:29:50.684 --> 01:29:53.915
That's for setting me up.
you undead prick.

1346
01:30:00.125 --> 01:30:02.990
Oh. yeah.

1347
01:30:04.725 --> 01:30:07.900
I feel fucking great.

1348
01:30:13.875 --> 01:30:14.734
Frank.

1349
01:30:14.869 --> 01:30:18.878
I told you not to fuck with me.

1350
01:30:19.014 --> 01:30:20.639
Please.

1351
01:30:20.775 --> 01:30:22.311
You better fucking run.

1352
01:30:31.557 --> 01:30:33.488
So you found Lambert.

1353
01:30:33.623 --> 01:30:34.887
Did he try to convince you

1354
01:30:35.023 --> 01:30:37.225
to take it all
before you killed him?

1355
01:30:41.531 --> 01:30:43.668
Our game ends here.

1356
01:30:44.767 --> 01:30:46.872
I've made sure of that.

1357
01:31:28.510 --> 01:31:30.550
No. Fuck.

1358
01:31:31.812 --> 01:31:34.213
I fucking hate ballet.

1359
01:31:56.938 --> 01:31:59.007
BOY
<i>Hello?</i>

1360
01:31:59.709 --> 01:32:02.181
Hey. Caleb. It's Mom.

1361
01:32:02.317 --> 01:32:04.146
<i>Gotcha. Ha-ha.</i>

1362
01:32:04.281 --> 01:32:07.019
<i>Can't come to the phone
right now. but leave a message.</i>

1363
01:32:08.483 --> 01:32:10.216
I...

1364
01:32:17.594 --> 01:32:20.028
I love you so much.

1365
01:32:22.898 --> 01:32:25.264
And I'm so proud of you.

1366
01:32:26.772 --> 01:32:28.871
You're the one good...

1367
01:32:29.006 --> 01:32:31.843
You're the one good thing
I did in life.

1368
01:32:32.646 --> 01:32:35.642
And I just needed you
to hear that.

1369
01:32:41.882 --> 01:32:44.618
I love you so much.

1370
01:32:44.753 --> 01:32:47.858
my sweet. sweet boy.

1371
01:32:49.496 --> 01:32:51.195
And I always have.

1372
01:32:51.330 --> 01:32:52.995
Aw.

1373
01:32:58.569 --> 01:33:01.267
Sorry to interrupt.

1374
01:33:14.822 --> 01:33:17.156
It's a little late
to be a good mom now.

1375
01:33:17.291 --> 01:33:18.619
don't you think?

1376
01:33:18.754 --> 01:33:21.560
You fucking junkie.

1377
01:33:21.695 --> 01:33:24.562
I'm gonna fucking
kill you. Frank.

1378
01:33:29.730 --> 01:33:31.003
Oh. yeah?

1379
01:33:59.799 --> 01:34:01.531
Why don't you just kill me?

1380
01:34:01.667 --> 01:34:03.368
Where's the fun in that?

1381
01:34:03.503 --> 01:34:05.301
You want to have some fun?

1382
01:34:05.436 --> 01:34:06.838
All right.

1383
01:34:10.609 --> 01:34:12.745
Let's have some fun.

1384
01:34:14.881 --> 01:34:18.616
I'm gonna make you
my fucking puppet.

1385
01:34:21.383 --> 01:34:24.985
And then we're gonna go see
that kid of yours.

1386
01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.991
And I'm gonna make you kill him.

1387
01:34:39.541 --> 01:34:41.534
I'm too weak to take him alone.

1388
01:34:42.337 --> 01:34:45.470
Help me kill him.
and I'll let you go.

1389
01:34:46.140 --> 01:34:48.978
You can see your son again.

1390
01:34:49.114 --> 01:34:52.350
♪ I got the whole
fucking world ♪

1391
01:34:52.485 --> 01:34:54.688

Look who came to join the party.

1394
01:35:05.798 --> 01:35:07.761
If you want to kill me.

1395
01:35:07.896 --> 01:35:09.967
you have to drain me.

1396
01:36:14.335 --> 01:36:16.429
Wait there.

1397
01:36:18.538 --> 01:36:20.433
Isn't this fun?

1398
01:37:22.129 --> 01:37:24.904
No. No.

1399
01:37:30.744 --> 01:37:32.912
You ready to join the team?

1400
01:37:41.047 --> 01:37:43.219
Oh. yeah.

Wakey-wakey. little puppet.

Oh. hey there.

1403
01:38:09.443 --> 01:38:12.578
I think it's time to play...

1404
01:38:14.455 --> 01:38:16.219
...my game.

1405
01:38:18.318 --> 01:38:23.028
Frank says. "Pick it up."

1406
01:38:40.275 --> 01:38:45.314
Frank says. "Get the fuck up."

1407
01:38:50.417 --> 01:38:53.553
Frank says. "Kill the girl."

1408
01:39:13.581 --> 01:39:15.447
Oh. God!

1409
01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:17.110
You little fuck!

1410
01:39:17.246 --> 01:39:18.278
You don't fucking quit.

1411
01:39:18.413 --> 01:39:20.519
You thought you could just

1412
01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:21.914
make her your puppet?

1413
01:39:48.777 --> 01:39:51.243
Here's the thing about
being a vampire. Frank.

1414
01:39:51.379 --> 01:39:54.017
It takes a long fucking time

1415
01:39:54.153 --> 01:39:56.649
to learn how to do
all the cool shit.

1416
01:39:57.689 --> 01:39:59.421
Oh. fu...

1417
01:40:25.981 --> 01:40:27.779
Thank you.

1418
01:40:33.825 --> 01:40:36.161
No problem.

1419
01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:53.979
Am I...?

1420
01:40:54.114 --> 01:40:56.676
You're fine. now that he's dead.

1421
01:41:12.533 --> 01:41:14.199
Um...

1422
01:41:15.869 --> 01:41:18.104
I think I'm gonna...

1423
01:41:20.607 --> 01:41:22.471
Yeah.

1424
01:41:29.048 --> 01:41:31.414
I hope you get Justin back.

1425
01:41:38.186 --> 01:41:40.018
It's Caleb.

1426
01:41:40.154 --> 01:41:42.458
I know.

1427
01:41:43.792 --> 01:41:48.365
For what it's worth.
you just have to show up.

1428
01:41:53.774 --> 01:41:55.001
- Father.

1429
01:42:06.147 --> 01:42:07.946
Lazaar.

1430
01:42:08.549 --> 01:42:11.284
I've gone by many names

1431
01:42:11.419 --> 01:42:14.151
over the countless years.

1432
01:42:17.424 --> 01:42:18.898
