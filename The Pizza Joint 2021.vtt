00:00:09.005 --> 00:00:11.195
to make a delicious pizza.

6
00:00:11.195 --> 00:00:12.856
You need fresh ingredients handled

7
00:00:12.856 --> 00:00:15.387
with care by skilled hands.

8
00:00:15.387 --> 00:00:18.948
And don't forget the most
important ingredient of all.

9
00:00:18.948 --> 00:00:23.638
the finest marijuana known
to man. Jamaican goddess.

10
00:00:23.638 --> 00:00:25.510
The goddess becomes purified

11
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.118
and liquified until it's just right.

12
00:00:28.118 --> 00:00:29.188
That's right.

13
00:00:29.188 --> 00:00:31.528
It's in the sauce. bitch.
(record scratching)

14
00:00:31.528 --> 00:00:34.603
- Listen. slut. I can
call you that. right?

15
00:00:34.603 --> 00:00:36.840
- Your fucking face is
like a car accident.

16
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.088
It's just so grotesque and tragic

17
00:00:39.088 --> 00:00:42.426
but I cannot fucking stop looking away.

18
00:00:42.426 --> 00:00:44.601
- Fuck you. bitch!
- Oh!

day at Phu King Pizza.

21
00:00:48.246 --> 00:00:49.629
- Oh hell no!
- Oh. hey!

22
00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.009

I'm Gus.

27
00:00:59.803 --> 00:01:02.701
I'm the manager.
(celery crunching)

28
00:01:02.701 --> 00:01:04.896
So our business is growing faster

29
00:01:04.896 --> 00:01:07.000
than we could have ever expected.

30
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.540
And we need a little
bit of help around here.

31
00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.196
You have to be able to adapt
to all kinds of things here.

32
00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:15.106
We go through everything.

33
00:01:15.106 --> 00:01:17.399
Wanna test your problem solving skills.

34
00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.438
Dammit. come on. get in there!

35
00:01:20.438 --> 00:01:23.498
Say you're stranded on a desert Island.

36
00:01:23.498 --> 00:01:26.130
A little bit of food. probably gonna die

37
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.538
and you actually are
gonna die really soon.

38
00:01:28.538 --> 00:01:30.915
You got a boat. but it's a piece of shit.

39
00:01:30.915 --> 00:01:32.994
What you gonna do to get off that Island?

40
00:01:32.994 --> 00:01:36.820
- Well. first. probably get on the boat.

41
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.171
- You're gonna have to talk up.

42
00:01:38.171 --> 00:01:41.182
I can not hear you.
(celery crunching)

43
00:01:41.182 --> 00:01:44.308
- Hi.
(mellow music)

44
00:01:44.308 --> 00:01:45.141
- Yeah.

45
00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:47.943
(applicant farts)

46
00:01:47.943 --> 00:01:51.138
You're probably gonna starve.

47
00:01:51.138 --> 00:01:53.456
- Well. I would gather what I could

48
00:01:53.456 --> 00:01:56.152
from the Island in order to fix the boat.

49
00:01:56.152 --> 00:01:58.985
- I think I'm just gonna die. bro.

50
00:01:59.856 --> 00:02:02.909
- All right. final question.

51
00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.941
Why do you want to work at Phu King Pizza?

52
00:02:06.941 --> 00:02:09.721
- Weird. I already work here.

53
00:02:09.721 --> 00:02:13.209
What's a matter with you?
(celery crunching)

54
00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.268
- Are you kidding me?
For the free pizza. man.

55
00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:18.929
So I can get fucked up every night.

56
00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.656
- Well. I. I think pizza
makes everyone happy

57
00:02:22.656 --> 00:02:26.486
and I mean everyone says that
you guys have the best pizza

58
00:02:26.486 --> 00:02:31.069
out there and I just. I think
it'd be fun to work here.

59
00:02:32.194 --> 00:02:36.248
- Well. I can go with my
instincts on this one.

60
00:02:36.248 --> 00:02:37.226
I got a hunch.

61
00:02:37.226 --> 00:02:39.231
Ariel. I know you've
never had a job before

62
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:42.107
but I'm gonna give you a chance.

63
00:02:42.107 --> 00:02:44.128
Can you start tomorrow?

64

67
00:03:29.653 --> 00:03:30.822
- What the fuck dad?

68
00:03:30.822 --> 00:03:32.136

69
00:03:32.136 --> 00:03:33.823

00:04:16.852 --> 00:04:19.636
- I'm gonna make you some coffee.

79
00:04:19.636 --> 00:04:20.469
- Okay.

80
00:04:24.386 --> 00:04:25.219
'Sup?

81
00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:34.070

83
00:04:40.093 --> 00:04:42.784
- Sweetie. it's been three
months since the wedding.

84
00:04:42.784 --> 00:04:44.451
you can call me mom.

85
00:04:45.579 --> 00:04:46.662
- Right. mom.

86
00:04:48.714 --> 00:04:50.838
It's not weird at all.

87
00:04:50.838 --> 00:04:52.900
(hand slapping)
Ow!

88
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.150
So. still looking for work?

89
00:04:56.055 --> 00:04:57.500
- Yeah. absolutely.

90
00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.619
And once I find a job. you
can go back to college.

91
00:05:01.619 --> 00:05:03.615
My son. the doctor.

92
00:05:03.615 --> 00:05:04.782
- I like that.

93
00:05:05.954 --> 00:05:07.884
- Anyway. I don't know.

94
00:05:07.884 --> 00:05:09.543
I might change majors when I go back.

95
00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:12.897
I was thinking of switching to botany.

96
00:05:12.897 --> 00:05:14.507
- Oh no son.

97
00:05:14.507 --> 00:05:16.604
You don't wanna be that kind of doctor.

98
00:05:16.604 --> 00:05:17.784
Olga had that down to her face

99
00:05:17.784 --> 00:05:20.294
and she can't express emotions anymore.

100
00:05:20.294 --> 00:05:24.627
Before she was all natural.
and now she's all stiff.

101
00:05:26.376 --> 00:05:28.726
- I think you're talking about Botox.

102
00:05:28.726 --> 00:05:33.014
Botany is the study of
plants and who the hell.

103
00:05:33.014 --> 00:05:33.921
who the hell's Olga?

104
00:05:33.921 --> 00:05:36.754

Today is gonna be kinda like an audition.

Whoever does the best job gets to stay.

131
00:06:38.122 --> 00:06:40.413
You got a job for the rest of your life

132
00:06:40.413 --> 00:06:42.784

- Man. what's her problem?

153
00:07:53.433 --> 00:07:56.051

157
00:08:02.764 --> 00:08:04.276

00:15:27.021 --> 00:15:29.232
- I mean. we. we don't
tell anyone what happened

357
00:15:29.232 --> 00:15:30.714
and we act normal for now until we.

358
00:15:30.714 --> 00:15:31.874
until we figure something out.

359
00:15:31.874 --> 00:15:33.365
- Well. we've better figure
something out quick. dude.

360
00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:36.685
'Cause Player. Player doesn't play.

361
00:15:36.685 --> 00:15:38.106
That sounds stupid when
you say it out loud.

362
00:15:38.106 --> 00:15:41.013
- Does. does sound pretty
stupid. but you're right. man.

363
00:15:41.013 --> 00:15:43.304
He doesn't mess around.

364
00:15:43.304 --> 00:15:44.401
He could actually kill us.

365
00:15:44.401 --> 00:15:46.107
- Man. I don't know.

366
00:15:46.107 --> 00:15:48.297
Last I heard he doesn't do
that gangster shit anymore.

367
00:15:48.297 --> 00:15:49.702
'cause he's legit now.

368
00:15:49.702 --> 00:15:51.086
- So maybe he'll like give
us a chance to pay it off

369
00:15:51.086 --> 00:15:52.060
over time or something. you know.

370
00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.727
like a payment plan.

371
00:15:55.781 --> 00:15:58.300

All I gotta do is hit

Ooh. everybody gets scared

428
00:18:13.977 --> 00:18:16.102

We got robbed.

434
00:18:24.844 --> 00:18:27.331
- Boys Playa Playa doesn't

435
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:28.547
I had to kill his own cousin last week

436
00:18:28.547 --> 00:18:29.931
because he stole some money.

437
00:18:29.931 --> 00:18:31.662
- Hey Shorty. I forgot to
tell you about that. man.

438
00:18:31.662 --> 00:18:33.330
My cousin wasn't the one who did it.

439
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.730
Family is pretty pissed off.

440
00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:36.490
Make sure they get a
card. says my bad on it.

441
00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.657
Put some flowers in there.

(Playa Playa laughs)

450
00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:55.533
That's funny.
- Yeah.

451
00:18:55.533 --> 00:18:57.481

- Yeah.
(speaks in foreign language)

456
00:19:03.824 --> 00:19:05.958
(all laughing)
- Shut the fuck up!

457
00:19:05.958 --> 00:19:07.766
Let me tell you guys something. all right?

458
00:19:07.766 --> 00:19:09.520
You guys don't tell me
when you're gonna get it.

459
00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.313
I tell you when you're
gonna get it. all right?

460
00:19:11.313 --> 00:19:12.192
You guys have my money

461
00:19:12.192 --> 00:19:13.189
or else you won't see the other side

462
00:19:13.189 --> 00:19:14.853
of Shorty you don't wanna see.

463
00:19:14.853 --> 00:19:18.779
- I promise to make it slow and painful.

464
00:19:18.779 --> 00:19:22.350
You'll be begging me to
shuffle off your mortal coil.

465
00:19:22.350 --> 00:19:23.320
- Shuffle off my whole.

466
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.539
you trying to touch my dick. Shorty?

467
00:19:24.539 --> 00:19:25.691
- Shh.
- Hey!

468
00:19:25.691 --> 00:19:28.675
Let me translate what the fuck
he said in simple English.

469
00:19:28.675 --> 00:19:30.865
You guys don't have the
money. he'll kill you.

470
00:19:30.865 --> 00:19:31.983
- Kill us?

471
00:19:31.983 --> 00:19:33.977
Look. man. we were hoping that like.

472
00:19:33.977 --> 00:19:35.986
you had left that whole part

473
00:19:35.986 --> 00:19:37.852
of your life behind. the killin' part.

474
00:19:37.852 --> 00:19:39.792
'cause you are. you're a
business man now. right?

475
00:19:39.792 --> 00:19:40.957
You're professional now.

476
00:19:40.957 --> 00:19:42.605
(Playa Playa laughs)

477
00:19:42.605 --> 00:19:45.009
- Ah. you're cute. man. I am professional.

478
00:19:45.009 --> 00:19:47.346
That's exactly why it's not personal.

479
00:19:47.346 --> 00:19:48.749
Business is business.

480
00:19:48.749 --> 00:19:51.203
You guys better have
my 20 large by tonight

481
00:19:51.203 --> 00:19:55.453
or I'll fucking have you
both killed and that's it.

482
00:19:57.202 --> 00:19:58.535
- Coming inside?

483
00:19:59.557 --> 00:20:00.390
- Not yet.

484
00:20:01.383 --> 00:20:03.178
- All right. well.

485
00:20:03.178 --> 00:20:04.303
I have to get back on the floor.

486
00:20:04.303 --> 00:20:07.136
Supposed to be training Ariel. so.

487
00:20:08.098 --> 00:20:09.098
See ya. man.

488
00:20:14.981 --> 00:20:16.562
- We about to die soon

489
00:20:16.562 --> 00:20:20.122
and this man got pussy on the brain.

490
00:20:20.122 --> 00:20:21.188
I'm so proud.

491
00:20:21.188 --> 00:20:22.338
- - yes. I'll take one severe. please.

492
00:20:22.338 --> 00:20:23.621
- [Gus] Great. that'll be $25.

493
00:20:23.621 --> 00:20:25.200
- All right. thank you.
- All right. thank you.

494
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.033
Have a good one.

495
00:20:26.033 --> 00:20:26.866
Come back and see us.

496
00:20:26.866 --> 00:20:30.144
Anthony. hey.
- What. Gus. man. the hair.

497
00:20:30.144 --> 00:20:30.977
- Oh. sorry.

498
00:20:30.977 --> 00:20:34.223
Where's Thomas?
- He's out back.

499
00:20:34.223 --> 00:20:39.223
(dogs barking)
(western music)

500
00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.409
- I'm gonna do it.

501
00:20:52.409 --> 00:20:53.409
Hey. Shorty.

502
00:20:54.699 --> 00:20:56.658
man. what was all that shuffling coil talk

503
00:20:56.658 --> 00:20:57.802
shit earlier. man?

504
00:20:57.802 --> 00:20:59.624
- It's from Shakespeare's "Hamlet."

505
00:20:59.624 --> 00:21:01.219
- Wow!

506
00:21:01.219 --> 00:21:06.157
Shakespeare. you art the artist
of hard to understand. man.

507
00:21:06.157 --> 00:21:07.717
- It's not hard to understand.

508
00:21:07.717 --> 00:21:09.907
Shakespeare is very beautiful and shit.

509
00:21:09.907 --> 00:21:10.883
I like it.

510
00:21:10.883 --> 00:21:12.294
You never know. I may
become an actor one day

511
00:21:12.294 --> 00:21:13.373
and perform Shakespeare.

512
00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:16.167
(both laughing)

513
00:21:16.167 --> 00:21:18.183
Did I say something funny?

514
00:21:18.183 --> 00:21:21.477
- No. Shorty.
- No. nothing funny at all.

515
00:21:21.477 --> 00:21:23.144
- I didn't think so.

516
00:21:24.432 --> 00:21:26.483
I must say I'm in a mood today.

517
00:21:26.483 --> 00:21:27.415
Those two pizza boys are dead

518
00:21:27.415 --> 00:21:29.002
no matter what Playa Playa says.

519
00:21:29.002 --> 00:21:32.057
- Yo. Playa Playa say
we can't just kill 'em.

520
00:21:32.057 --> 00:21:34.230
then we can't just go
over there in the store.

521
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:38.200
blasting everybody away. taking
brains out of people heads.

522
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:41.350
- By my sword. I swear there
is no power in the tongue

523
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:42.933
of man to alter me.

524
00:21:44.645 --> 00:21:47.228
Oh. come on. nothing? That's
from "The Merchant Of Venice."

525
00:21:47.228 --> 00:21:49.197
- I knew that shit. I knew
it. Shorty. I got you.

526
00:21:49.197 --> 00:21:51.441
- I knew that.
- Shh.

527
00:21:51.441 --> 00:21:52.808
I feel like leaving an ominous message

528
00:21:52.808 --> 00:21:55.757
for our two favorite pizza guys.

529
00:21:55.757 --> 00:21:57.481
- What. ominous. ominous?
- Is that.

530
00:21:57.481 --> 00:22:01.962
Is that like giving them a
note of something. Shorty?

531
00:22:01.962 --> 00:22:03.447
♪ Come to the show. then
you know what I mean ♪

532
00:22:03.447 --> 00:22:05.575

(hand slapping)

533
00:22:05.575 --> 00:22:06.658
- What. mom. I wasn't-

534
00:22:06.658 --> 00:22:08.810
(mom speaks in foreign language)

535
00:22:08.810 --> 00:22:12.133
Okay.
(speaks in foreign language)

536
00:22:12.133 --> 00:22:13.598
Okay!

537
00:22:13.598 --> 00:22:17.765
(mom speaks in foreign language)

538
00:22:23.533 --> 00:22:26.002
- [Client] Thanks for
the straight pepperoni.

539
00:22:26.002 --> 00:22:26.835
- Oh damn.

540
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:29.560
- Who's that?

541
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.109
- Sir Thomas's parents.
yeah. they own Phu King.

542
00:22:32.109 --> 00:22:33.746
This place is named after his mom.

543
00:22:33.746 --> 00:22:34.597
They actually own the business.

544
00:22:34.597 --> 00:22:37.312
but gave it to Thomas to run.

545
00:22:37.312 --> 00:22:38.829
(mom speaks in foreign language)

546
00:22:38.829 --> 00:22:40.514
- Hello. Mr. and Ms. King.

547
00:22:40.514 --> 00:22:41.978
Nice of you to join us today.

548
00:22:41.978 --> 00:22:45.301
(mom speaks in foreign language)

549
00:22:45.301 --> 00:22:47.140
- Nice to see you. Gus. how's business?

550
00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.804
- Oh. business is very good.

551
00:22:48.804 --> 00:22:50.261
over the last couple months.

552
00:22:50.261 --> 00:22:53.737
(mom speaks in foreign language)

553
00:22:53.737 --> 00:22:55.091
- How's Thomas been doing?

554
00:22:55.091 --> 00:22:57.049
- Thomas. Thomas. Thomas has been great.

555
00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:59.397
He's very. very pleasure to work for.

556
00:22:59.397 --> 00:23:01.582
He allows me the space I
need to run a tight ship.

557
00:23:01.582 --> 00:23:05.785
(mom speaks in foreign language)

558
00:23:05.785 --> 00:23:08.364
- She says. "Thank you
for your hard work. Gus."

559
00:23:08.364 --> 00:23:12.031
- You're very welcome.
thank you. thank you.

560
00:23:15.156 --> 00:23:17.382
- She seems nice.
(Anthony scoffs)

561
00:23:17.382 --> 00:23:18.712
- Yeah.

562
00:23:18.712 --> 00:23:21.879
She actually just called Gus an idiot.

563
00:23:24.893 --> 00:23:28.285
(Thomas yells)

564
00:23:28.285 --> 00:23:30.061
- Hey. dad.
- Hi. Thomas.

565
00:23:30.061 --> 00:23:32.544
(mom speaks in foreign language)

566
00:23:32.544 --> 00:23:33.377
- For what?

567
00:23:33.377 --> 00:23:35.289
(mom speaks in foreign language)

568
00:23:35.289 --> 00:23:37.981
Mom. things are better.
okay? Just trust me.

569
00:23:37.981 --> 00:23:40.508
(mom speaks in foreign language)

570
00:23:40.508 --> 00:23:42.705
- Yeah. but it's only by
like one month this time

571
00:23:42.705 --> 00:23:44.772
instead of four or five. like before.

572
00:23:44.772 --> 00:23:48.939
(mom speaks in foreign language)

573
00:24:02.090 --> 00:24:06.840
- You know. we used to do
million dollar worldwide deals.

574
00:24:08.062 --> 00:24:10.645
working with the most powerful.

575
00:24:12.675 --> 00:24:14.925
And we took what we wanted.

576
00:24:18.417 --> 00:24:19.667
Now look at us.

577
00:24:22.107 --> 00:24:24.690
look at us. playing with pizza.

578
00:24:26.732 --> 00:24:28.065
For chum change.

579
00:24:36.655 --> 00:24:39.084
(Shorty sighs)

580
00:24:39.084 --> 00:24:44.084
you know. for whatever reason.
Playa Playa has a soft spot

581
00:24:44.398 --> 00:24:46.731
for that stupid pizza joint.

582
00:24:49.648 --> 00:24:54.624
And honestly. I don't give a
shit what Playa Playa says.

583
00:24:54.624 --> 00:24:55.791
It ends today.

584
00:24:56.949 --> 00:25:00.032
- But we work for Playa Playa. right?

585
00:25:01.582 --> 00:25:04.662
- Yeah. if he finds out. I mean.

586
00:25:04.662 --> 00:25:06.465
you know how he is. Shorty.

587
00:25:06.465 --> 00:25:11.465
Who's gonna deal with that?
(suspenseful music)

588
00:25:14.028 --> 00:25:17.811
- Well. tell me then what
would you have me do?

589
00:25:17.811 --> 00:25:19.083
(gun firing)

590
00:25:19.083 --> 00:25:20.812
Seek for the patronage of some great man

591
00:25:20.812 --> 00:25:23.388
and like a creeping vine
and a tall tree crawl upward

592
00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:24.844
where I cannot stand alone?

593
00:25:24.844 --> 00:25:26.159
No thank you.

594
00:25:26.159 --> 00:25:27.983
Eat a toad for breakfast every morning.

595
00:25:27.983 --> 00:25:29.173
make my knees callous

596
00:25:29.173 --> 00:25:30.635
and cultivate a supple spine

597
00:25:30.635 --> 00:25:33.344
while my belly groveling in the dust?

598
00:25:33.344 --> 00:25:35.104
No thank you.

599
00:25:35.104 --> 00:25:37.361
Shall I labor night and
day and build a reputation

600
00:25:37.361 --> 00:25:40.361
on one song and never write another?

601
00:25:41.512 --> 00:25:42.852
No thank you.

602
00:25:42.852 --> 00:25:44.081
No. I thank you.

603
00:25:44.081 --> 00:25:45.664
And again. I think.

604
00:25:46.706 --> 00:25:51.706
(Shorty screams)
(suspenseful music)

605
00:25:53.076 --> 00:25:54.106
- Are you kidding me?

606
00:25:54.106 --> 00:25:55.687
What the?

607
00:25:55.687 --> 00:25:58.020
What are they fucking doing?

608
00:25:59.447 --> 00:26:04.114
No. Are you serious?
(suspenseful music)

609
00:26:20.802 --> 00:26:23.719
(knocking at door)

610
00:26:31.177 --> 00:26:32.570
- Come on in.

611
00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:33.570
- All right.

612
00:26:36.032 --> 00:26:37.748
- Just put the pizza down right there.

613
00:26:37.748 --> 00:26:38.748
- All right.

614
00:26:42.645 --> 00:26:45.842
- So do. the astronaut pizza is 25 bucks.

615
00:26:45.842 --> 00:26:48.425
- All right. oh. just a second.

616
00:26:49.559 --> 00:26:50.445
There you go.

617
00:26:50.445 --> 00:26:52.413
Keep the change there. baby.

618
00:26:52.413 --> 00:26:53.825
- Sticky. thanks.

619
00:26:53.825 --> 00:26:55.636
- Sit down and chill with me for a minute.

620
00:26:55.636 --> 00:26:56.636
- All right.

621
00:27:00.370 --> 00:27:01.911
- You wanna hit this shit?

622
00:27:01.911 --> 00:27:04.903
- Ma'am I always have
time for a smoke break.

623
00:27:04.903 --> 00:27:07.192
(both laughing)

624
00:27:07.192 --> 00:27:08.753
- It's not as good as
that Jamaican goddess

625
00:27:08.753 --> 00:27:11.004
you guys are putting in them pizzas.

626
00:27:11.004 --> 00:27:13.378
But it'll knock the booboo
out of you a little bit.

627
00:27:13.378 --> 00:27:14.544
- This shit is good though.

628
00:27:14.544 --> 00:27:16.081
(client laughs)
- Thanks. man.

629
00:27:16.081 --> 00:27:17.164
- Yeah. shit.

630
00:27:19.041 --> 00:27:21.596
What do you know about
that Jamaican goddess?

631
00:27:21.596 --> 00:27:23.847
(client laughs)
- Shit. girl.

632
00:27:23.847 --> 00:27:26.033
The stories I could tell you.

633
00:27:26.033 --> 00:27:27.681
I used to live in Jamaica.

634
00:27:27.681 --> 00:27:30.051
- No way.
- Yeah. when I was younger.

635
00:27:30.051 --> 00:27:32.701
firmer. and a whole lot tighter.

636
00:27:32.701 --> 00:27:34.568
(both laughing)

637
00:27:34.568 --> 00:27:35.841
- Well. how long was it?

638
00:27:35.841 --> 00:27:39.251
- Man. it was just last summer.

639
00:27:39.251 --> 00:27:41.371
- Well. good for you.

640
00:27:41.371 --> 00:27:44.912
- So. seriously now. you got a man?

641
00:27:44.912 --> 00:27:46.416
- You don't even wanna go there.

642
00:27:46.416 --> 00:27:47.467
You don't fucking wanna go there.

643
00:27:47.467 --> 00:27:48.703
There's this dude.

644
00:27:48.703 --> 00:27:49.834
He's disgusting.

645
00:27:49.834 --> 00:27:53.685
Just fucking gross. the
dumb ass and you know what?

646
00:27:53.685 --> 00:27:57.985
I like him. for some fucking
stupid reason. I like him.

647
00:27:57.985 --> 00:27:59.261
- Love never makes no sense. dear.

648
00:27:59.261 --> 00:28:00.927
- You know he pisses me off though?

649
00:28:00.927 --> 00:28:02.215
I try and give him hints. you know?

650
00:28:02.215 --> 00:28:03.362
Like I liked him.

651
00:28:03.362 --> 00:28:06.272
Motherfucker doesn't do anything. nothing.

652
00:28:06.272 --> 00:28:07.605
Clues and hints?

653
00:28:09.058 --> 00:28:09.975
Shit. girl.

654
00:28:12.423 --> 00:28:16.756
If you want a man. you gotta
reach out and grab him.

655
00:28:18.975 --> 00:28:21.692
(Jasmine roaring)

656
00:28:21.692 --> 00:28:24.442
(birds chirping)

657
00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:37.350
(doorbell ringing)
(elevator music)

658
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.233
- Nice shoes.

659
00:28:42.305 --> 00:28:44.305
You're not the pool guy.

660
00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.410
- Oh. is the my Phu King pizza?

661
00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:52.629
Oh. thanks.
(lady moaning)

662
00:28:52.629 --> 00:28:53.462
Oh.

663
00:28:57.125 --> 00:28:59.958
- Dude. is that your fucking wife?

664
00:29:01.035 --> 00:29:02.535
She's fucking hot.

665
00:29:05.112 --> 00:29:06.862
- Yes. she's my wife.

666
00:29:09.422 --> 00:29:11.589
Go get some help. pervert.

667
00:29:13.485 --> 00:29:18.485
(door slamming)
(elevator music continues)

668
00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.105
- What the fuck?

669
00:29:43.105 --> 00:29:45.151
Yo. chief. you're blocking me here.

670
00:29:45.151 --> 00:29:46.663
- That piece of shit?

671
00:29:46.663 --> 00:29:48.084
Thought it was abandoned.

672
00:29:48.084 --> 00:29:50.711
Look here. Pedro. can't
get past the border.

673
00:29:50.711 --> 00:29:52.079
stay on your side.

674
00:29:52.079 --> 00:29:56.111
This is America.
(pool guy grunts)

675
00:29:56.111 --> 00:29:58.542
- Whatever David Duke.

676
00:29:58.542 --> 00:30:00.294
- David Duke? That's a good one.

677
00:30:00.294 --> 00:30:02.096
You got me there.

678
00:30:02.096 --> 00:30:03.987
- Ondalay. dude.

679
00:30:03.987 --> 00:30:08.070
- I'm just trying to do
a job Americans Won't do.

680
00:30:12.915 --> 00:30:16.362
- Hey. you guys in the movie business?

681
00:30:16.362 --> 00:30:18.756
- Sorta. used to be.

682
00:30:18.756 --> 00:30:20.780
Turns out they really sucked at it.

683
00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:24.200
Man. they only give you one audition.

684
00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:25.376
- Oh.

685
00:30:25.376 --> 00:30:27.183
- You do kinda look
like that Burt Reynolds

686
00:30:27.183 --> 00:30:29.068
from that "Deliverance" movie.

687
00:30:29.068 --> 00:30:32.376
- "Deliverance?" Yeah. think so?

688
00:30:32.376 --> 00:30:34.615
- Well. no. not really.

689
00:30:34.615 --> 00:30:36.951
You know. more like rich. new friends.

690
00:30:36.951 --> 00:30:37.934
Screw like a pig.

691
00:30:37.934 --> 00:30:39.377
- Fuck you. man.

692
00:30:39.377 --> 00:30:40.551
Whatever.

693
00:30:40.551 --> 00:30:44.801
Hey. I heard them fucking
pizzas got drugs in them.

694
00:30:45.860 --> 00:30:47.362
- No man.
- You're still here.

695
00:30:47.362 --> 00:30:50.346
- There's nothing illegal
here. all natural.

696
00:30:50.346 --> 00:30:51.763
- Fucking stoner.

697
00:30:52.718 --> 00:30:54.718
- Vamanos. man. come on.

698
00:30:55.648 --> 00:30:57.005
- The astronaut's really strong.

699
00:30:57.005 --> 00:30:59.597
I would suggest for first
timers a silky smooth.

700
00:30:59.597 --> 00:31:02.311
it's a lot more relaxed
and chill. you know?

701
00:31:02.311 --> 00:31:04.561
Shorty. hey. what's up man?

702
00:31:05.401 --> 00:31:06.543
- Where's Harold?

703
00:31:06.543 --> 00:31:07.376
- Who?

704
00:31:08.644 --> 00:31:10.700
- The Chinaman.

705
00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.003
- Oh you mean Thomas?

706
00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:12.836
He's not Chinese.

707
00:31:12.836 --> 00:31:15.115
He's actually more like
Filipino mixed with Tai.

708
00:31:15.115 --> 00:31:16.463
- I don't care what the heck. Linus.

709
00:31:16.463 --> 00:31:19.433
let's go get him and have a talk.

710
00:31:19.433 --> 00:31:20.516
- Okay. okay.

711
00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:23.547
You should stay with Gus.

712
00:31:23.547 --> 00:31:24.831
I'll be right back.

713
00:31:24.831 --> 00:31:26.581
Don't worry about it.

714
00:31:32.394 --> 00:31:35.248
- Hey. chill out. man! Chill.
- Chill. dude!

715
00:31:35.248 --> 00:31:36.084
We had an agreement!

716
00:31:36.084 --> 00:31:37.017
- Man. I'm taking your ass home.

717
00:31:37.017 --> 00:31:37.850
- Go. go!

718
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:40.412
- Chill out. man.

719
00:31:40.412 --> 00:31:42.729
Yo. what happened. dude?

720
00:31:42.729 --> 00:31:43.682
What the hell. Shorty?

721
00:31:43.682 --> 00:31:47.217
You can't come up here starting shit.

722
00:31:47.217 --> 00:31:48.050
Wah!

723
00:31:50.048 --> 00:31:51.403
- Come on. I want you to.

724
00:31:51.403 --> 00:31:53.382
- I'm half Tai. bro. I
know more Tai. what's up?

725
00:31:53.382 --> 00:31:54.887
- Okay. okay.
(Thomas heaves)

726
00:31:54.887 --> 00:31:56.387
- Dude. damn. man!

727
00:32:01.147 --> 00:32:04.120
(Shorty laughs)
- My problem.

728
00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:06.905
your friend has a big fucking
mouth. so I shut it for him.

729
00:32:06.905 --> 00:32:08.753
I don't believe you boys
understand the severity

730
00:32:08.753 --> 00:32:10.323
of the situation.

731
00:32:10.323 --> 00:32:12.000
When you don't pay Playa Playa.

732
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.730
you're taking food away
from all this baby mamas.

733
00:32:14.730 --> 00:32:17.481
People die for that shit.

734
00:32:17.481 --> 00:32:19.459
Get up. Get the fuck up!
(men heaving)

735
00:32:19.459 --> 00:32:23.609
You. you took what was
supposed to be mine.

736
00:32:23.609 --> 00:32:25.988
- Man. we ain't take
shit from your bitch ass.

737
00:32:25.988 --> 00:32:28.655
(Thomas heaves)

738
00:32:30.303 --> 00:32:31.642
- You better not even
think of skipping town.

739
00:32:31.642 --> 00:32:33.475
because I'll find you.

740
00:32:36.697 --> 00:32:38.659
See you later.

741
00:32:38.659 --> 00:32:39.492
- Oh.

742
00:32:41.374 --> 00:32:42.568
Oh.

743
00:32:42.568 --> 00:32:43.485
My ovaries.

744
00:32:44.522 --> 00:32:47.331
Shorty's punk ass. man. I hate him.

745
00:32:47.331 --> 00:32:48.369
- What'd you think was
gonna happen. Thomas?

746
00:32:48.369 --> 00:32:50.619
You was talking shit. dude.

747
00:32:52.903 --> 00:32:53.736
All right. man.

748
00:32:53.736 --> 00:32:56.401
I've got a couple of grand saved at home.

749
00:32:56.401 --> 00:32:58.011
I mean. it was supposed to be for college

750
00:32:58.011 --> 00:33:01.843
but can't go to college if I'm dead.

751
00:33:01.843 --> 00:33:03.122
How about you?

752
00:33:03.122 --> 00:33:05.717
- If I empty out my accounts
and then sell some of my stuff.

753
00:33:05.717 --> 00:33:10.322
I'll probably get like
another five GS on top of it.

754
00:33:10.322 --> 00:33:14.090
- If we take the roughly
like I dunno like two grand.

755
00:33:14.090 --> 00:33:16.526
two. yeah. $2.000 that
we made today in sales.

756
00:33:16.526 --> 00:33:21.526
I think that's. shit. dude.
we're still 10 grand short.

757
00:33:21.655 --> 00:33:23.822
- Oh my God. we're fucked.

758
00:33:27.196 --> 00:33:28.790
- Think maybe your parents
can lend us some money?

759
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:31.873
- Hah! Dude. no. oh shit. my parents!

760
00:33:33.239 --> 00:33:35.026
I forgot I'm supposed to get
lunch with them and Chenae.

761
00:33:35.026 --> 00:33:37.936
my mom's been on my ass
about introducing them.

762
00:33:37.936 --> 00:33:39.913
- Think they're gonna flip?

763
00:33:39.913 --> 00:33:42.746
- My dad will be fine. but my mom.

764
00:33:43.982 --> 00:33:48.149
my mom will trip. flip.
double dip. all that shit.

00:33:50.384 --> 00:33:51.521

766
00:33:51.521 --> 00:33:54.188

767
00:33:55.945 --> 00:33:58.028
- I'm stopping right now.

00:33:59.745 --> 00:34:02.603
Pick up. pick up. Nico. Areola.

00:34:05.469 --> 00:34:08.386
Pick up.
(spitting)

771
00:34:12.995 --> 00:34:13.964
Is there a problem. officer?

772
00:34:13.964 --> 00:34:15.547
- Shut the fuck up.

773
00:34:17.053 --> 00:34:19.216
Are you the guy from
that fucking pizza joint?

774
00:34:19.216 --> 00:34:21.966
- Yeah. It's pronounced Phu King.

775
00:34:23.207 --> 00:34:24.224
- We don't care.

776
00:34:24.224 --> 00:34:26.615
We ordered two two silky smooth pizzas

777
00:34:26.615 --> 00:34:28.865
over half an hour ago. son.

778
00:34:31.109 --> 00:34:32.473
- Oh.

779
00:34:32.473 --> 00:34:33.329
Okay.

780
00:34:33.329 --> 00:34:34.497
Yeah. yeah.

00:34:34.497 --> 00:34:35.902
Yeah. I got them right here.

782
00:34:35.902 --> 00:34:37.471
- Whoa! What're you reaching for?

783
00:34:37.471 --> 00:34:38.724
- Whoa! Put your hands behind your back!

784
00:34:38.724 --> 00:34:39.557
- Wait. wait. wait. wait!

785
00:34:39.557 --> 00:34:41.721
No. no. no. no. no!
(cops yelling)

786
00:34:41.721 --> 00:34:42.936
No. no. no!

787
00:34:42.936 --> 00:34:44.655

788
00:34:44.655 --> 00:34:45.861
Oh. oh. oh fuck!

789
00:34:45.861 --> 00:34:47.844
- Just wait!

790
00:34:47.844 --> 00:34:50.134
- Pulled out a gun!
- Shoot him!

791
00:34:50.134 --> 00:34:50.967
- Guns.
(Cujo crying)

792
00:34:50.967 --> 00:34:52.485
(cop laughing)

793
00:34:52.485 --> 00:34:55.068
- You look so stupid right now.

794
00:34:56.656 --> 00:34:57.905
- Just water.

795
00:34:57.905 --> 00:34:59.988
- I peed in mine.
- Gross.

796
00:35:01.247 --> 00:35:03.687
Look. man. we just wanted
to stop you and tell you

797
00:35:03.687 --> 00:35:05.922
that we know what you guys are doing

798
00:35:05.922 --> 00:35:07.517
over at that pizza joint.

799
00:35:07.517 --> 00:35:09.063
- You do?
- Hell yeah.

800
00:35:09.063 --> 00:35:11.388
You have the best damn
pizza we've ever had tasted.

801
00:35:11.388 --> 00:35:12.221
- Woo!

802
00:35:13.401 --> 00:35:15.276
Just some advice.

803
00:35:15.276 --> 00:35:17.377
There've been a lot of local
robberies at these stores.

804
00:35:17.377 --> 00:35:19.397
So watch your six.

805
00:35:19.397 --> 00:35:21.395
- Contact us if you need anything else.

806
00:35:21.395 --> 00:35:23.007
Good day.

807
00:35:23.007 --> 00:35:23.840
- Okay.

808
00:35:44.108 --> 00:35:46.775
(siren wailing)

809
00:35:50.791 --> 00:35:53.374
- Those guys are fucking crazy.

810
00:35:55.565 --> 00:35:57.232
Patronizing me. man.

811
00:35:58.426 --> 00:36:01.009
Nobody puts Cujo in the corner.

812
00:36:04.193 --> 00:36:07.086
(Cujo cries)

813
00:36:07.086 --> 00:36:10.169
(upbeat salsa music)

814
00:36:12.088 --> 00:36:13.659
- I gotta do this right
now. my Rambo's kicked me.

815
00:36:13.659 --> 00:36:15.492
- What the fuck you doing?

816
00:36:15.492 --> 00:36:16.706
Sit your ass down.

817
00:36:16.706 --> 00:36:18.134
- You know. my Rambo's
kicking right now. babe.

818
00:36:18.134 --> 00:36:20.604
- Can't do this here-
- This is your sliced pizza.

819
00:36:20.604 --> 00:36:21.457
- Ah. thanks. sir.
- There's yours.

820
00:36:21.457 --> 00:36:22.662

- Enjoy your trip.
- Thank you so much. man.

822
00:36:25.163 --> 00:36:26.007
- What the fuck is wrong with you?

823
00:36:26.007 --> 00:36:27.906
- It's hard. man. we gotta go.
- We gotta plan this shit out.

824
00:36:27.906 --> 00:36:30.302
- So when we doing this? What's the plan?

825
00:36:30.302 --> 00:36:31.135
- Thank you.

826
00:36:31.135 --> 00:36:31.968
We gotta go deal-

828
00:36:33.357 --> 00:36:35.316
Thad boy in that makeup. that was stupid.

829
00:36:35.316 --> 00:36:36.218
My skin is sensitive.

830
00:36:36.218 --> 00:36:37.481
Couldn't take my cousin to the prom

831
00:36:37.481 --> 00:36:38.520
'cause of the pimples from-

832
00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:40.291

All right. so this is the
wall right here. right?

834
00:36:41.958 --> 00:36:42.791
- This wall.

835
00:36:42.791 --> 00:36:45.170
- Now let's pretend it's
napkin dispenser is the wall.

836
00:36:45.170 --> 00:36:46.829
So put that wall right there.

837
00:36:46.829 --> 00:36:48.215
- Yeah. All right.

00:36:48.215 --> 00:36:50.931

841
00:36:55.339 --> 00:36:56.848
- Oh. that's the salt.

00:36:56.848 --> 00:36:58.514

00:36:58.514 --> 00:36:59.846
- Gotcha. listening.
- Yes. man.

844
00:36:59.846 --> 00:37:01.028
So. at the end of the day.

00:37:01.028 --> 00:37:03.125
so what they do is. they take the money

846
00:37:03.125 --> 00:37:05.321
from the cash register to the back.

847
00:37:05.321 --> 00:37:07.106
- How you know this?

848
00:37:07.106 --> 00:37:08.510

857
00:37:26.659 --> 00:37:29.905
- Do it properly.

858
00:37:29.905 --> 00:37:33.794
- Whoa. whoa. whoa. what're

00:46:28.731 --> 00:46:30.935
So how're you liking it here so far?

1059
00:46:30.935 --> 00:46:33.251
- It's good. yeah.
- Yeah?

1060
00:46:33.251 --> 00:46:35.019
- I mean. I like spending time with you.

1061
00:46:35.019 --> 00:46:36.003
You make things more fun.

1062
00:46:36.003 --> 00:46:37.153
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1063
00:46:37.153 --> 00:46:38.127
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1064
00:46:38.127 --> 00:46:39.404
(both chuckling)

1065
00:46:39.404 --> 00:46:44.064
- Well maybe we should hang
out sometime. you know.

1066
00:46:44.064 --> 00:46:45.209
get to know each other a little better.

1067
00:46:45.209 --> 00:46:47.186
- Yeah. yeah. yeah. I'd love that.

1068
00:46:47.186 --> 00:46:48.044
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1069
00:46:48.044 --> 00:46:50.094
- All right. cool.

1070
00:46:50.094 --> 00:46:51.468
- So I have a question.

1071
00:46:51.468 --> 00:46:52.301
What's the difference

1072
00:46:52.301 --> 00:46:55.265
between all the pizzas that you guys sell?

1073
00:46:55.265 --> 00:46:58.774
- Well. a couple of examples.
we have a blast from the past

1074
00:46:58.774 --> 00:47:00.515
which gets people so high

1075
00:47:00.515 --> 00:47:03.902
that they like see their
dead relatives and shit.

1076
00:47:03.902 --> 00:47:04.917
And then I know. I know.

1077
00:47:04.917 --> 00:47:06.616
And then you have the astronaut

1078
00:47:06.616 --> 00:47:09.011
which gets you so high.
think you're up in space.

1079
00:47:09.011 --> 00:47:10.395
- Oh.
(Ariel laughs)

1080
00:47:10.395 --> 00:47:12.440
So do you smoke a lot?

1081
00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.393
(inhaling)
(whistle sliding)

1082
00:47:15.393 --> 00:47:17.141
(exhaling)
- No. No.

1083
00:47:17.141 --> 00:47:18.491
I mean. not really.

1084
00:47:18.491 --> 00:47:20.228
I mean a little. a little. a little

1085
00:47:20.228 --> 00:47:21.579
a little more than usual.
yeah. I guess you could say.

1086
00:47:21.579 --> 00:47:23.712
- You smoke a lot.

1087
00:47:23.712 --> 00:47:24.545
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1088
00:47:24.545 --> 00:47:26.628
- Yeah. yeah.
- It's okay.

1089
00:47:28.611 --> 00:47:30.917
- Listen. I have to. I have to head out.

1090
00:47:30.917 --> 00:47:32.041
I have to run home for lunch.

1091
00:47:32.041 --> 00:47:33.994
- But just stick around
for. with this for now

1092
00:47:33.994 --> 00:47:35.752
and then. yeah. I shouldn't be that long.

1093
00:47:35.752 --> 00:47:37.560
- Okay. well hurry back.
- All right. cool. come on.

1094
00:47:37.560 --> 00:47:38.393
- Okay.

1095
00:47:40.038 --> 00:47:40.980
- Hey. got it.

1096
00:47:40.980 --> 00:47:43.069
Yeah. man.
- Dude. what took you so long?

1097
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:44.578
- I waited for Gus. he
went in the bathroom.

1098
00:47:44.578 --> 00:47:45.411
- I didn't want him to
see I'm taking shit.

1099
00:47:45.411 --> 00:47:46.842
- Man. what you doing?

1100
00:47:46.842 --> 00:47:48.570
You can't just dive in a pizza.

1101
00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:49.403
- Why not?

1102
00:47:49.403 --> 00:47:50.456
- This ain't no piece of plastic.

1103
00:47:50.456 --> 00:47:52.991
You just can't in it. this ain't no pool.

1104
00:47:52.991 --> 00:47:54.074
- I know what it is. all right.

1105
00:47:54.074 --> 00:47:55.875
- This got the Jamaican
goddess up in here.

1106
00:47:55.875 --> 00:47:57.393
- That's right.
- So you gotta pray

1107
00:47:57.393 --> 00:47:59.052
before you eat this pizza.
- What the fuck?

1108
00:47:59.052 --> 00:48:00.999
- You gotta have some faith in it.

1109
00:48:00.999 --> 00:48:01.832
- You serious?
- You. yes.

1110
00:48:01.832 --> 00:48:02.932
you got gotta have the Holy ghost

1111
00:48:02.932 --> 00:48:04.175
before you eat this pizza.

1112
00:48:04.175 --> 00:48:06.813
So let's do a prayer. I'ma
let you start out. come on.

1113
00:48:06.813 --> 00:48:09.728
Let's pray before that naked
mole rat come back out here.

1114
00:48:09.728 --> 00:48:10.561
- All right.
- Come on.

1115
00:48:10.561 --> 00:48:11.931
- All right.

1116
00:48:11.931 --> 00:48:13.614
Oh. dear Jamaican goddess.

1117
00:48:13.614 --> 00:48:15.644
Thank you for shining your light on us.

1118
00:48:15.644 --> 00:48:17.780
- Well.

1119
00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:20.341
these costumes and-
- Well.

1120
00:48:20.341 --> 00:48:22.347
- giving us this appetite.

1121
00:48:22.347 --> 00:48:24.796
- Well.
- And thank you

1122
00:48:24.796 --> 00:48:26.386
for making us high.
- Hallelujah.

1123
00:48:26.386 --> 00:48:27.476
Thank you Jesus.

1124
00:48:27.476 --> 00:48:30.290
- Oh my God.
- Oh my goodness.

1125
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:31.216
- Thank you.

1126
00:48:31.216 --> 00:48:33.999
(both laughing)

1127
00:48:33.999 --> 00:48:38.833
- Once these two pizza boys
miss their deadline tonight.

1128
00:48:38.833 --> 00:48:41.250
it'll be their last delivery.

1129
00:48:47.012 --> 00:48:48.431
- Hey. man. Gabby wants
to know if you're hungry.

1130
00:48:48.431 --> 00:48:51.589
She can warm up some food for you.

1131
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:53.948
- I'm not really hungry. thanks.

1132
00:48:53.948 --> 00:48:54.865
- You okay?

1133
00:48:58.032 --> 00:48:59.217
- Not really.

1134
00:48:59.217 --> 00:49:00.050
- What's. what's wrong.

1135
00:49:00.050 --> 00:49:02.359
Ah. Anthony. don't tell me.
you got a girl pregnant.

1136
00:49:02.359 --> 00:49:03.814
- No.
- Whew.

1137
00:49:03.814 --> 00:49:05.564
- It's not like that.

1138
00:49:10.401 --> 00:49:12.739
I owe a lot of money to
that guy. Playa Playa.

1139
00:49:12.739 --> 00:49:13.739
- Damn. son.

1140
00:49:14.905 --> 00:49:18.880
Shit. and I hear Playa Playa doesn't play.

1141
00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:20.459
That sounded kinda weird.

1142
00:49:20.459 --> 00:49:21.326
- Yeah. when you say it out loud.

1143
00:49:21.326 --> 00:49:23.879
- I know I said it.
- Yeah.

1144
00:49:23.879 --> 00:49:26.955
- Hey. you know when I look at you.

1145
00:49:26.955 --> 00:49:31.112
you remind me a lot of
myself when I was your age.

1146
00:49:31.112 --> 00:49:32.355
That's not what I meant.

1147
00:49:32.355 --> 00:49:34.761
What I meant was when I
was your age I fell in love

1148
00:49:34.761 --> 00:49:37.965
with your mother. God. rest her soul.

1149
00:49:37.965 --> 00:49:40.442
She was the most beautiful
woman I'd ever seen.

1150
00:49:40.442 --> 00:49:42.616
And then your grandpa. he
puts a shotgun in my face.

1151
00:49:42.616 --> 00:49:44.144
I'm like. whoa. dude. hold on. man.

1152
00:49:44.144 --> 00:49:45.343
I didn't screw you a goat.

1153
00:49:45.343 --> 00:49:46.176
(imitates bleating)

1154
00:49:46.176 --> 00:49:47.780
that doesn't spell (speaks
in foreign language).

1155
00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:50.484
And if it does. prove it. better
yet. check the semen on it.

1156
00:49:50.484 --> 00:49:51.578
It's not even mine.

1157
00:49:51.578 --> 00:49:54.684
As a matter of fact. I remember
like it was just yesterday.

1158
00:49:54.684 --> 00:49:57.428
I met your mom.
(voice distorts)

1159
00:49:57.428 --> 00:49:59.957
But it was after mass of
course. it was after mass.

1160
00:49:59.957 --> 00:50:01.164
(voice distorts)
I said. you know what.

1161
00:50:01.164 --> 00:50:02.644
to hell with the devil.

1162
00:50:02.644 --> 00:50:04.724
we're gonna get married now.

1163
00:50:04.724 --> 00:50:06.622
(dad chuckles)

1164
00:50:06.622 --> 00:50:11.006
Oh man. that's such a nice
story. don't you think?

1165
00:50:11.006 --> 00:50:13.103
- I'm not gonna lie.

1166
00:50:13.103 --> 00:50:14.983
I wasn't really listening.
(dad chuckles)

1167
00:50:14.983 --> 00:50:17.236
- Look. son. the point is.

1168
00:50:17.236 --> 00:50:20.457
sometimes it life. you just
gotta roll with the punches.

1169
00:50:20.457 --> 00:50:23.228
I'm sure you'll figured something out.

1170
00:50:23.228 --> 00:50:25.751
(hand slamming butt)

1171
00:50:25.751 --> 00:50:27.924
- Okay. we gotta go.

1172
00:50:27.924 --> 00:50:31.424
The rolling pit. ah. dad. you are a freak.

1173
00:50:32.521 --> 00:50:34.111
(girl moaning)

1174
00:50:34.111 --> 00:50:35.694
- Yeah. behind her.

1175
00:50:36.753 --> 00:50:38.420
- You little fucker!

1176
00:50:42.961 --> 00:50:46.461
- [Cujo] Knew you'd like Cujo style. baby.

1177
00:50:47.723 --> 00:50:49.920
Cujo style! Yeah!

1178
00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:50.753
Ah.

1179
00:50:50.753 --> 00:50:51.596
aha.

1180
00:50:51.596 --> 00:50:54.732
ah. I knew you'd like
Cujo style. baby. come on.

1181
00:50:54.732 --> 00:50:56.982
You know you love it. yeah.

1182
00:50:59.196 --> 00:51:00.029
- Get out!

1183
00:51:00.029 --> 00:51:01.002
- What?
- What the fuck you doing.

1184
00:51:01.002 --> 00:51:02.711
man?
- What?

1185
00:51:02.711 --> 00:51:03.794
- Gross! Ugh!

1186
00:51:05.913 --> 00:51:06.996
- Wait! Wait!

1187
00:51:08.574 --> 00:51:09.927
Fucking foot.

1188
00:51:09.927 --> 00:51:10.760
Hey. wait.

1189
00:51:11.919 --> 00:51:13.154
Wait!

1190
00:51:13.154 --> 00:51:15.521
I can't help it. it's a disease!

1191
00:51:15.521 --> 00:51:19.195
- Ugh. wipe your. ugh. fuck. gross.

1192
00:51:19.195 --> 00:51:20.755
- Sorry.

1193
00:51:20.755 --> 00:51:22.564
- You don't have to do
that to yourself. man.

1194
00:51:22.564 --> 00:51:25.064
Just abuse yourself like that.

1195
00:51:26.069 --> 00:51:27.651
- I don't have the money to pay a hooker

1196
00:51:27.651 --> 00:51:30.006
to do it for me. come on.

1197
00:51:30.006 --> 00:51:33.225
(Jasmine scoffing)

1198
00:51:33.225 --> 00:51:35.392
Wait. where are you going?

1199
00:51:36.894 --> 00:51:37.811
- Fuck off!

1200
00:51:39.184 --> 00:51:43.934
- What about old faithful?
(Cujo yelling)

1201
00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:46.533
Fuck!

1202
00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:56.946
- I hate working with stoners.

1203
00:51:56.946 --> 00:52:00.719
- Dammit. the fucker. Cujo. the dammit!

1204
00:52:00.719 --> 00:52:03.084
Cujo. what do I need to
do to make you understand

1205
00:52:03.084 --> 00:52:04.089
that I like you?

1206
00:52:04.089 --> 00:52:06.957
Seriously. dude. how can
I be more freaking clear?

1207
00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:10.040
Ugh!
(Jasmine grunts)

1208
00:52:12.124 --> 00:52:15.234
You're crazy! Crazy.
- Jasmine?

1209
00:52:15.234 --> 00:52:16.067
- What?

1210
00:52:17.444 --> 00:52:20.602
(lady laughs)
- No.

1211
00:52:20.602 --> 00:52:24.352
That is mine.
(both laughing)

1212
00:52:27.129 --> 00:52:29.528
What do you want?
- More pizza.

1213
00:52:29.528 --> 00:52:32.445
How long have we been sitting here?

1214
00:52:33.762 --> 00:52:34.893
- Whoa. excuse me?

1215
00:52:34.893 --> 00:52:37.390
- Yes.
- Is it tomorrow yet?

1216
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:39.217
- No. but You two have been sitting here

1217
00:52:39.217 --> 00:52:43.634
for almost two hours.
(both laughing)

1218
00:52:52.567 --> 00:52:54.646
- Grandpa Harry?

1219
00:52:54.646 --> 00:52:57.732
Grandpa. Harry. is that you?

1220
00:52:57.732 --> 00:52:59.680
- Aunt Chelsea

1221
00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.001
Is that really you?

1222
00:53:01.001 --> 00:53:04.014
- How?
(both laughing)

1223
00:53:04.014 --> 00:53:07.084
- Did you two order blast
from the past pizza?

1224
00:53:07.084 --> 00:53:10.049
(both laughing)
- Really good.

1225
00:53:10.049 --> 00:53:11.483
but I need a moment.

1226
00:53:11.483 --> 00:53:14.462
I haven't seen my grandfather in 15 years.

1227
00:53:14.462 --> 00:53:16.120
And I would like to speak with him.

1228
00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.508
(both laughing)
- Yes!

1229
00:53:18.508 --> 00:53:19.341
Hi.
- Yeah.

1230
00:53:21.258 --> 00:53:22.465
sure. have fun.

1231
00:53:22.465 --> 00:53:25.548
(laughing continues)

1232
00:53:34.842 --> 00:53:35.779
- What's wrong?

1233
00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:37.405
- What is wrong?

1234
00:53:37.405 --> 00:53:38.956
You're asking me what's wrong.

1235
00:53:38.956 --> 00:53:40.503
I'll tell you what's wrong.

1236
00:53:40.503 --> 00:53:42.465
Cujo. that is what's wrong.

1237
00:53:42.465 --> 00:53:43.512
- What did he do?

1238
00:53:43.512 --> 00:53:44.436
- What he do?

1239
00:53:44.436 --> 00:53:47.148
He call me hooker. a whore.

1240
00:53:47.148 --> 00:53:48.991
Do I look like a whore to you?

1241
00:53:48.991 --> 00:53:50.067
Look at me.

1242
00:53:50.067 --> 00:53:51.354
- Not at all.

1243
00:53:51.354 --> 00:53:54.391
Cujo needs a hooker. a
whore. a woman of the night.

1244
00:53:54.391 --> 00:53:55.930
- I know.

1245
00:53:55.930 --> 00:53:56.936
I'm ready.

1246
00:53:56.936 --> 00:53:58.381
- Give the Jasmine.

1247
00:53:58.381 --> 00:54:01.131
Love. love is like a pizza. okay?

1248
00:54:02.359 --> 00:54:03.942
The crest is trust.

1249
00:54:05.412 --> 00:54:07.662
The sauce is communication.

1250
00:54:09.581 --> 00:54:12.588
Cheese. cheese is laughter.

1251
00:54:12.588 --> 00:54:15.657
The pepperoni. that's that good stuff.

1252
00:54:15.657 --> 00:54:16.592
That good lovin'.

1253
00:54:16.592 --> 00:54:17.806
What you wanna do is you wanna get

1254
00:54:17.806 --> 00:54:20.006
all of those together. okay?

1255
00:54:20.006 --> 00:54:22.920
You wanna put 'em in the
oven. you wanna bake 'em

1256
00:54:22.920 --> 00:54:26.755
'til the cheese melts and that
pepperoni soaks into that.

1257
00:54:26.755 --> 00:54:29.070
soaks into that crust.

1258
00:54:29.070 --> 00:54:30.891
- You wanna pin the box.

1259
00:54:30.891 --> 00:54:33.695
and take it out for delivery.

1260
00:54:33.695 --> 00:54:35.440
No. right now. you got a delivery.

1261
00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.273
- Oh.

1262
00:54:36.273 --> 00:54:38.394
- Awesome. thanks. Jasmine. high five.

1263
00:54:38.394 --> 00:54:39.798
Go get it.

1264
00:54:39.798 --> 00:54:40.821
- [Anthony] So dude.

1265
00:54:40.821 --> 00:54:42.383
- Oh. what's up doc.

1266
00:54:42.383 --> 00:54:44.458
Just chillin' man. trying to ease my mind.

1267
00:54:44.458 --> 00:54:45.751
get a tan. you know?

1268
00:54:45.751 --> 00:54:47.401
- So. what's up?

1269
00:54:47.401 --> 00:54:50.121
- Hey. what's up with
you and the new girl?

1270
00:54:50.121 --> 00:54:51.737
- I really don't know yet.

1271
00:54:51.737 --> 00:54:53.091
What do you think of her?

1272
00:54:53.091 --> 00:54:54.393
- She seems cool. man.

1273
00:54:54.393 --> 00:54:57.568
Sexy. yeah.
- She seems really sweet.

1274
00:54:57.568 --> 00:55:00.207
- Yeah. You gonna smash her or what?

1275
00:55:00.207 --> 00:55:02.737
- Ha! It's not like that. man.

1276
00:55:02.737 --> 00:55:04.917
- What you mean is not like that?

1277
00:55:04.917 --> 00:55:07.101
- It's different. you know?

1278
00:55:07.101 --> 00:55:08.059
- All right. man. well look.

1279
00:55:08.059 --> 00:55:11.408
whatever you do. just make
sure you keep Isabella

1280
00:55:11.408 --> 00:55:13.643
as far away from her as you can.

1281
00:55:13.643 --> 00:55:17.060
That girl is a crazy psycho killer bitch.

1282
00:55:28.731 --> 00:55:30.181
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1283
00:55:30.181 --> 00:55:31.475
- Excuse me?

1284
00:55:31.475 --> 00:55:32.997
- Who are you?

1285
00:55:32.997 --> 00:55:34.230
- Excuse me.

1286
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:35.063
- Ugh!

1287
00:55:37.954 --> 00:55:39.272
- Ariel.

1288
00:55:39.272 --> 00:55:40.105
- Ariel?

1289
00:55:41.762 --> 00:55:44.841
- Anthony. come quick. Isabella out front

1290
00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:46.725
and she 'cause big problems.

1291
00:55:46.725 --> 00:55:49.054
- Oh. Ariel like the bitch fish

1292
00:55:49.054 --> 00:55:50.949
from like the "Under The Sea" movie?

1293
00:55:50.949 --> 00:55:53.577
Oh my gosh. I thought that it. hey.

1294
00:55:53.577 --> 00:55:54.441
- What the hell are you doing?

1295
00:55:54.441 --> 00:55:56.121
Remember. you can't be coming up here.

1296
00:55:56.121 --> 00:55:57.806
- Why can't I be coming up here?

1297
00:55:57.806 --> 00:56:00.926
- Because you make Gus
nervous with your crazy ass.

1298
00:56:00.926 --> 00:56:02.826
- I have 911 on speed dial.

1299
00:56:02.826 --> 00:56:04.586
- God you're a pussy.

1300
00:56:04.586 --> 00:56:05.549
So what up?

1301
00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:07.407
Are we getting back together or what?

1302
00:56:07.407 --> 00:56:08.569
- Or what.

1303
00:56:08.569 --> 00:56:09.658
- Shut your vagina. Thomas!

1304
00:56:09.658 --> 00:56:10.891
No. one's talking to you!

1305
00:56:10.891 --> 00:56:12.726
- We're not getting back
together. all right?

1306
00:56:12.726 --> 00:56:13.559
- What?

1307
00:56:14.637 --> 00:56:16.788
Is it because of that bitch?

1308
00:56:16.788 --> 00:56:18.352
- The fuck you just call me?

1309
00:56:18.352 --> 00:56:19.491
- Hey. don't call her that.

1310
00:56:19.491 --> 00:56:20.562
- Did you get in her panties yet?

1311
00:56:20.562 --> 00:56:22.446
- It's her first day.

1312
00:56:22.446 --> 00:56:25.504
- Yeah. like I said. did
you get in her panties yet?

1313
00:56:25.504 --> 00:56:27.182
She looks like the type
that gives it away.

1314
00:56:27.182 --> 00:56:28.622
This girl had dick for breakfast.

1315
00:56:28.622 --> 00:56:31.444
(Thomas laughs)

1316
00:56:31.444 --> 00:56:35.965
Come on. baby. you know
I can't get over you.

1317
00:56:35.965 --> 00:56:40.300
(explosion rumbling)
- What have you done?

1318
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:41.717
What've you done?

1319
00:56:46.074 --> 00:56:48.907
- Was it worth liking her picture?

1320
00:56:50.205 --> 00:56:51.302
(Isabella giggles)

1321
00:56:51.302 --> 00:56:53.497
- You know. the best way to
get over somebody is to get

1322
00:56:53.497 --> 00:56:54.699
under somebody. bruh.

1323
00:56:54.699 --> 00:56:57.129
and she smashed everybody on the block.

1324
00:56:57.129 --> 00:56:57.962
- Can it. Thomas!

1325
00:56:57.962 --> 00:57:02.562
Oh. I'll take my heel off
and I'll shove it so far!

1326
00:57:02.562 --> 00:57:04.405
Why don't you wanna be with me?

1327
00:57:04.405 --> 00:57:06.668
- Seriously? You cheated
on me like 14 times.

1328
00:57:06.668 --> 00:57:07.501
- 17.

1329
00:57:09.039 --> 00:57:10.586
- Seriously. dude?
- Yeah bro.

1330
00:57:10.586 --> 00:57:13.207
I have it marked every day in my calendar

1331
00:57:13.207 --> 00:57:16.220
for every time that you called
me up crying like a bitch

1332
00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:17.795
because she cheated on you.

1333
00:57:17.795 --> 00:57:22.545
Trust me. Isabella is a lying.
dirty. funky. diseased ho.

1334
00:57:24.304 --> 00:57:25.466
- Shut the hell up.

1335
00:57:25.466 --> 00:57:26.423
Go smoke a Dick.

1336
00:57:26.423 --> 00:57:29.198
- I learned how to do
it from watching you.

1337
00:57:29.198 --> 00:57:30.104
- What?

1338
00:57:30.104 --> 00:57:32.527
- That didn't sound right.

1339
00:57:32.527 --> 00:57:34.204
- Look. you need to go. all right?

1340
00:57:34.204 --> 00:57:35.704
Gus. call 'em now.

1341
00:57:37.577 --> 00:57:41.899
- You need to stop staring
'cause I will kick your ass.

1342
00:57:41.899 --> 00:57:44.401
- Try it.
- Ladies. come on.

1343
00:57:44.401 --> 00:57:45.833
- Man. let 'em go.
- Thomas.

1344
00:57:45.833 --> 00:57:48.952
- Listen. slut. I can call you that right?

1345
00:57:48.952 --> 00:57:51.166
Your fucking face is like a car accident.

1346
00:57:51.166 --> 00:57:53.453
It's just so grotesque and tragic

1347
00:57:53.453 --> 00:57:56.658
but I cannot fucking stop looking away.

1348
00:57:56.658 --> 00:57:58.517
- Fuck you. bitch.

1349
00:57:58.517 --> 00:58:00.313
- Oh!
- Oh. hell no!

1350
00:58:00.313 --> 00:58:01.417
- Let her come at me!

1351
00:58:01.417 --> 00:58:03.340
(chaotic yelling)

1352
00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.008
- Get out of here. now!

1353
00:58:05.008 --> 00:58:06.475
- You're on a death watch!

1354
00:58:06.475 --> 00:58:09.586
- You're not gonna do shit. bitch!

1355
00:58:09.586 --> 00:58:11.253
- Fuck you. asshole!

1356
00:58:12.502 --> 00:58:14.835
Best Phu King pizza. my ass.

1357
00:58:17.878 --> 00:58:20.223
- Cops are on their way!

1358
00:58:20.223 --> 00:58:21.601
- Yeah.

1359
00:58:21.601 --> 00:58:24.491
- She is like sexy in a crazy way.

1360
00:58:24.491 --> 00:58:27.658
(everyone applauding)

1361
00:58:30.568 --> 00:58:33.212
- Hey. Gus. call the cops back
man. tell 'em not to come.

1362
00:58:33.212 --> 00:58:35.586
- I never called 'em. I was bluffing.

1363
00:58:35.586 --> 00:58:38.336
(door squeaking)

1364
00:58:39.914 --> 00:58:41.872
- Hey guys. hey. hey. hey!

1365
00:58:41.872 --> 00:58:43.615
Listen. we need y'all in the office

1366
00:58:43.615 --> 00:58:44.573
for a quick safety meeting. all right?

1367
00:58:44.573 --> 00:58:45.740
You too. Seth.

1368
00:58:56.023 --> 00:58:59.161
Guys. y'all remember
how we almost got shut

1369
00:58:59.161 --> 00:59:00.272
down a while back. right?

1370
00:59:00.272 --> 00:59:01.683
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1371
00:59:01.683 --> 00:59:03.800
- But no matter how bad
things got Thomas made sure

1372
00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.839
all of us got paid on time without fail.

1373
00:59:06.839 --> 00:59:07.848
Part of our deal with Playa Playa is

1374
00:59:07.848 --> 00:59:09.215
that we pay him 20 grand every month

1375
00:59:09.215 --> 00:59:12.447
for using his Jamaican goddess.

1376
00:59:12.447 --> 00:59:16.367
But last night someone
stole our payment money.

1377
00:59:16.367 --> 00:59:17.669
- Don't look at me.

1378
00:59:17.669 --> 00:59:18.885
I didn't do it.

1379
00:59:18.885 --> 00:59:22.347
- I didn't do it either.
- It wasn't me. man.

1380
00:59:22.347 --> 00:59:24.078
- Hey. what about Gus?

1381
00:59:24.078 --> 00:59:25.941
- Man. we all know Gus is too stupid

1382
00:59:25.941 --> 00:59:28.077
to try something like that.

1383
00:59:28.077 --> 00:59:30.037
Bottom line is me and Anthony gotta pay

1384
00:59:30.037 --> 00:59:32.642
up by midnight tonight
or we get dealt with.

1385
00:59:32.642 --> 00:59:35.290
(Cujo laughs)
- Holy shit.

1386
00:59:35.290 --> 00:59:36.409
I'm working with two dead guys.

1387
00:59:36.409 --> 00:59:37.856
- Shut the fuck up.
- Ow!

1388
00:59:37.856 --> 00:59:39.965
- Boom.
- Okay. Okay.

1389
00:59:39.965 --> 00:59:42.978
I thought Playa Playa was all legit now.

1390
00:59:42.978 --> 00:59:44.183
- So did we.

1391
00:59:44.183 --> 00:59:46.426
Look Thomas and I put our money together

1392
00:59:46.426 --> 00:59:48.348
and if I take the roughly four
grand that we've made today

1393
00:59:48.348 --> 00:59:50.636
in sales. that puts us at about 16

1394
00:59:50.636 --> 00:59:52.721
but we're still four short.

1395
00:59:52.721 --> 00:59:53.888
- We are dead.

1396
00:59:55.666 --> 00:59:59.221
- Look. this is our fault. all right?

1397
00:59:59.221 --> 01:00:00.634
If things go bad. it's on us.

1398
01:00:00.634 --> 01:00:05.051
And if you guys wanna bail.
we completely understand.

1399
01:00:06.714 --> 01:00:09.797
- I have about $200 saved up at home.

1400
01:00:12.131 --> 01:00:14.725
It's yours if you want it. man.

1401
01:00:14.725 --> 01:00:16.507
- Thank you. man. thank you.
- Thank you.

1402
01:00:16.507 --> 01:00:18.090
- I have about 400.

1403
01:00:21.248 --> 01:00:22.239
- That's awesome. thank you.
- Thank you.

1404
01:00:22.239 --> 01:00:23.239
- Thank you.

1405
01:00:25.433 --> 01:00:28.576
- What? I got nothing. zilch.

1406
01:00:28.576 --> 01:00:31.466
All my porn subscription
sites are expensive.

1407
01:00:31.466 --> 01:00:35.316
- You have a fucking
problem. dude. you know that?

1408
01:00:35.316 --> 01:00:37.076
- That's okay. all right?

1409
01:00:37.076 --> 01:00:39.332
That gives us 600 more. right?

1410
01:00:39.332 --> 01:00:43.050
That means we're only $3.400 short.

1411
01:00:43.050 --> 01:00:44.251
Load up all your deliveries.

1412
01:00:44.251 --> 01:00:47.025
Remember to bring money
in on the way back.

1413
01:00:47.025 --> 01:00:48.506
Thomas. you and me.
- All right.

1414
01:00:48.506 --> 01:00:51.339
(edgy rock music)

1415
01:00:53.189 --> 01:00:58.189
(cat screeching)
(edgy rock music continues)

1416
01:01:03.914 --> 01:01:05.302
- Phu King Pizza!

1417
01:01:05.302 --> 01:01:06.719
- Phu King Pizza.

1418
01:01:08.599 --> 01:01:13.599
- Good night. papa.
(edgy rock music continues)

1419
01:01:32.670 --> 01:01:37.670
(boxes rumbling)
(edgy rock music continues)

1420
01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:54.260
(cash register dinging)
(edgy rock music continues)

1421
01:02:13.941 --> 01:02:18.941
(Cujo yelling)
(edgy rock music continues)

1422
01:02:19.518 --> 01:02:23.685
- Woo!
(edgy rock music continues)

1423
01:02:28.510 --> 01:02:29.343
- What's up?

1424
01:02:29.343 --> 01:02:33.260
Ah!
(edgy rock music continues)

1425
01:02:34.947 --> 01:02:39.947
- I can bite you. come on now.
(edgy rock music continues)

1426
01:02:50.094 --> 01:02:52.890
- A blowjob from a babe
with three nipples.

1427
01:02:52.890 --> 01:02:55.164
My papa's gonna be so proud.

1428
01:02:55.164 --> 01:02:55.997
Yeah!

1429
01:02:59.069 --> 01:03:02.217
- Okay. send Thomas. put
in a lights out. nice.

1430
01:03:02.217 --> 01:03:05.884
(edgy rock music continues)

1431
01:03:18.381 --> 01:03:21.640
(both yelling)
- Oh. oh my God.

1432
01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.136
We have 10 more pizzas to make.

1433
01:03:23.136 --> 01:03:25.553
- No. no. don't. no. no more.

1434
01:03:27.973 --> 01:03:29.306
No more!

1435
01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:30.358
(Chad laughing)
- Yeah.

1436
01:03:30.358 --> 01:03:31.235
I've got this sign all day.

1437
01:03:31.235 --> 01:03:32.373
- I can't even see it.

1438
01:03:32.373 --> 01:03:34.997
- Okay guys. listen up.

1439
01:03:34.997 --> 01:03:36.705
Chad.
- I'm Will. he's Chad.

1440
01:03:36.705 --> 01:03:38.457
- Yeah. I'm Chad and that's Will.

1441
01:03:38.457 --> 01:03:39.730
- Whatever.

1442
01:03:39.730 --> 01:03:43.775
Look. today was really. really bad. guys.

1443
01:03:43.775 --> 01:03:44.748
- What?
- What?

1444
01:03:44.748 --> 01:03:46.238
Hey.

1445
01:03:46.238 --> 01:03:47.803
What. our shit was solid.

1446
01:03:47.803 --> 01:03:48.636
- Yeah.

1447
01:03:50.232 --> 01:03:51.530
- You're kidding me. right?

1448
01:03:51.530 --> 01:03:55.037
- No. man. sign spin is a
lot harder than you think.

1449
01:03:55.037 --> 01:03:57.484
- All right. you're joking.
it's not hard at all.

1450
01:03:57.484 --> 01:03:58.933
- Have you ever tried it?

1451
01:03:58.933 --> 01:03:59.766
- No.

1452
01:04:02.709 --> 01:04:04.209
- Well. you should try it
'cause it's pretty hard.

1453
01:04:04.209 --> 01:04:05.700
- I don't have to.

1454
01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:08.593
I don't want. I don't have to
try it. okay? I'm a manager.

1455
01:04:08.593 --> 01:04:11.040
See that? It says Gus. manager.

1456
01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.980
I'm the boss here. okay?
- Okay.

1457
01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:14.067
- And you guys suck.

1458
01:04:14.067 --> 01:04:15.652
- You suck.

1459
01:04:15.652 --> 01:04:17.134
- [Chad] You must be blind.

1460
01:04:17.134 --> 01:04:20.334
- Look. you guys did
horrible today. shitty.

1461
01:04:20.334 --> 01:04:22.821
- So. which one of us got the job?

1462
01:04:22.821 --> 01:04:24.961
- Neither one of you got the job.

1463
01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:26.215
I'm not hiring you. either one

1464
01:04:26.215 --> 01:04:28.100
of your sorry asses.
- Man. that is fucked up. man.

1465
01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:30.678
- I had to wear this stupid
shit all day for nothing?

1466
01:04:30.678 --> 01:04:33.116
- Hey. hey.
- You said you was gonna hire

1467
01:04:33.116 --> 01:04:33.949
one of us.

1468
01:04:33.949 --> 01:04:35.321
- Well. you said one
of you guys were gonna

1469
01:04:35.321 --> 01:04:38.187
actually work. okay?
- Old naked mole rat.

1470
01:04:38.187 --> 01:04:40.663
- Turn your uniforms in. gimme your sign.

1471
01:04:40.663 --> 01:04:41.811
I'll be inside.

1472
01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:44.294
Thank you and goodbye.

1473
01:04:44.294 --> 01:04:48.019
(upbeat salsa music)

1474
01:04:48.019 --> 01:04:51.269
- Cujo. why is everyone in such a rush?

1475
01:04:52.414 --> 01:04:55.122
- I don't know nothing from nothing.

1476
01:04:55.122 --> 01:04:58.029
but we gotta come up with $3.400

1477
01:04:58.029 --> 01:05:02.682
or else Playa Playa's gonna
kill Anthony and Thomas.

1478
01:05:02.682 --> 01:05:04.891
- Okay. Who's Playa Playa

1479
01:05:04.891 --> 01:05:08.187
and why is he gonna
kill Anthony and Thomas?

1480
01:05:08.187 --> 01:05:09.515
- See. this is what happens

1481
01:05:09.515 --> 01:05:13.035
when Cujo doesn't release
his cracking. you know.

1482
01:05:13.035 --> 01:05:15.479
they got me all running around.

1483
01:05:15.479 --> 01:05:17.891
a dog cannot release his nut.

1484
01:05:17.891 --> 01:05:20.507
Jasmine's all pissed off at me.

1485
01:05:20.507 --> 01:05:23.840
She wants me to go to sex therapy. fuck.

1486
01:05:26.258 --> 01:05:27.371
- Answer my question

1487
01:05:27.371 --> 01:05:29.750
or I swear to God I
will kick the testicles

1488
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:34.083
clean off your body.
(Cujo whimpers)

1489
01:05:36.151 --> 01:05:39.318
(upbeat salsa music)

1490
01:05:43.252 --> 01:05:45.835
- You know. two dead guys. man.

1491
01:05:46.849 --> 01:05:49.914
that's like more money for us.

1492
01:05:49.914 --> 01:05:51.896
- Fucking kidding. man?
- It's our space.

1493
01:05:51.896 --> 01:05:54.480
- Yeah. they're our friends.
dude. what the fuck?

1494
01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.032
- Not my problem.
- Fuck are we gonna do?

1495
01:05:57.032 --> 01:05:58.346
- I don't know.

1496
01:05:58.346 --> 01:06:00.379
- You know what? We should
all throw our tip money.

1497
01:06:00.379 --> 01:06:02.376
Just for today. you know. just in case.

1498
01:06:02.376 --> 01:06:05.809
- No. I can't give my tip money.

1499
01:06:05.809 --> 01:06:08.301
I got monthly porn sites to pay. come on.

1500
01:06:08.301 --> 01:06:10.741
- For fuck's sake. Cujo. you know what?

1501
01:06:10.741 --> 01:06:13.492
If you give your tip money.
I'll have sex with you.

1502
01:06:13.492 --> 01:06:14.325
All right?

1503
01:06:16.381 --> 01:06:17.943
- What is there to think about dude?

1504
01:06:17.943 --> 01:06:19.943
Get that boom. boom pow.

1505
01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:26.487
- But like paying Jasmine is
like calling Jasmine my whore.

1506
01:06:28.759 --> 01:06:30.766
which is sexy and all. but.

1507
01:06:30.766 --> 01:06:32.747
- You motherfucker!
- What?

1508
01:06:32.747 --> 01:06:35.217
- If you had half of a brain
in that thick skull of you.

1509
01:06:35.217 --> 01:06:37.972
you will realize that I fucking like you.

1510
01:06:37.972 --> 01:06:42.722
you stupid (speaks in foreign language).

1511
01:06:46.991 --> 01:06:48.741
- Not okay. see. man.

1512
01:06:54.769 --> 01:06:57.019
- Hey. what's up? I'm back.

1513
01:06:59.663 --> 01:07:01.659
Need some help?

1514
01:07:01.659 --> 01:07:04.825
- I need to talk to you. but not out here.

1515
01:07:04.825 --> 01:07:05.658
- Okay.

1516
01:07:11.069 --> 01:07:13.538
What's up. what's wrong?

1517
01:07:13.538 --> 01:07:15.131
- Cujo told me that you
were gonna be killed

1518
01:07:15.131 --> 01:07:17.653
because some drug dealer
guy with a stupid name.

1519
01:07:17.653 --> 01:07:19.927
- Playa Playa isn't even
a drug dealer anymore.

1520
01:07:19.927 --> 01:07:22.208
Wait. Cujo told you about that?

1521
01:07:22.208 --> 01:07:26.269
- That foamy mouthed. disg.
ooh man. I should stick my foot

1522
01:07:26.269 --> 01:07:28.342
up his ass. but he'd probably like it.

1523
01:07:28.342 --> 01:07:30.032
- Why aren't you just asking me?

1524
01:07:30.032 --> 01:07:32.108
- Why should I have to
tell you anything. huh?

1525
01:07:32.108 --> 01:07:34.753
This is your first day.

1526
01:07:34.753 --> 01:07:35.586
You know what. I don't even have time

1527
01:07:35.586 --> 01:07:36.758
for this right now. okay?

1528
01:07:36.758 --> 01:07:40.341
As you know I have a
lot of pizzas to sell.

1529
01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.813
- Is he always like this?

1530
01:07:43.813 --> 01:07:45.778
- Don't be mad at him.

1531
01:07:45.778 --> 01:07:47.528
This is all my fault.

1532
01:07:51.583 --> 01:07:54.852
- You know. this reminds me of "Hamlet."

1533
01:07:54.852 --> 01:07:58.685
When sorrows come. they
come not single spies.

1534
01:08:00.608 --> 01:08:04.608
but in battalions.
(thug crying)

1535
01:08:09.777 --> 01:08:11.610
What's wrong with you?

1536
01:08:13.113 --> 01:08:16.678
- He read the end of "Romeo And Juliet."

1537
01:08:16.678 --> 01:08:18.572
- Everyone dies. Shorty.

1538
01:08:18.572 --> 01:08:19.991
And they were just kids. man.

1539
01:08:19.991 --> 01:08:22.292
- Man. see. I told him
not to ruin it for me.

1540
01:08:22.292 --> 01:08:24.162
- I ruined it? I ruined shit. man.

1541
01:08:24.162 --> 01:08:26.131
- Yeah. you just told me how-
- Yeah. but don't listen.

1542
01:08:26.131 --> 01:08:28.231
- Like. how am I gonna
end that tootie. tootie

1543
01:08:28.231 --> 01:08:29.564
in my fucking ears?
- Oh man. you'd say

1544
01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:31.284
you ain't gotta hear it.
- You. shut up!

1545
01:08:31.284 --> 01:08:34.534
You should shut up and just drink this.

1546
01:08:37.822 --> 01:08:40.905
(mellow salsa music)

1547
01:08:42.112 --> 01:08:45.043
(phone ringing)

1548
01:08:45.043 --> 01:08:45.876
- What's up bro?

1549
01:08:45.876 --> 01:08:47.158
- Yeah. Can you do me a favor?

1550
01:08:47.158 --> 01:08:48.426
Can you meet me at the docks?

1551
01:08:48.426 --> 01:08:50.493
We're going down and I
don't wanna get blazed

1552
01:08:50.493 --> 01:08:52.410
with you one last time.

1553
01:08:56.294 --> 01:08:58.820
- Yeah. Yeah. I'm here bro.

1554
01:08:58.820 --> 01:09:00.535
Yeah. I'll see you in 10 minutes.

1555
01:09:00.535 --> 01:09:01.368
Okay.

1556
01:09:08.599 --> 01:09:11.599
- You look beat. are you okay. Seth?

1557
01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:13.523
Hey. at least you don't have to deal

1558
01:09:13.523 --> 01:09:15.850
with these crazy ass customers out there.

1559
01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:18.847
Can't be that bad back
here in the kitchen.

1560
01:09:18.847 --> 01:09:21.097
- I make all pizza all day.

1561
01:09:22.489 --> 01:09:25.530
I pee myself 'cause I
don't even go to bathroom.

1562
01:09:25.530 --> 01:09:28.738
- Well go to the bathroom
now. I could. go.

1563
01:09:28.738 --> 01:09:33.106
- In my country we don't
leave job unfinished.

1564
01:09:33.106 --> 01:09:35.463
- I can finish this for you. just go.

1565
01:09:35.463 --> 01:09:37.880
- No! You no touch my pizzas.

1566
01:09:38.811 --> 01:09:41.413
I break your fucking arm up to elbow.

1567
01:09:41.413 --> 01:09:44.157
Go. comb that fucked up
hair or something like that.

1568
01:09:44.157 --> 01:09:46.720
- Fine. you do it. asshole.

1569
01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.930
Don't piss yourself anymore.
that calls for violation.

1570
01:09:48.930 --> 01:09:52.097
(gentle guitar music)

1571
01:10:05.279 --> 01:10:06.739
- [Thomas] 'Sup. man?

1572
01:10:06.739 --> 01:10:07.572
- 'Sup?

1573
01:10:12.346 --> 01:10:13.179
(Thomas sighs)

1574
01:10:13.179 --> 01:10:16.523
- It's one hell of a mess. huh?

1575
01:10:16.523 --> 01:10:17.356
- Yeah.

1576
01:10:17.356 --> 01:10:21.023
- Look. man. this. this
is on me. all right?

1577
01:10:22.621 --> 01:10:25.544
If I hadn't messed everything
up at the pizza joint already.

1578
01:10:25.544 --> 01:10:27.710
we wouldn't even be in any
of this mess if I hadn't-

1579
01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:31.043
- Bro. hey. this isn't all on you. okay?

1580
01:10:32.675 --> 01:10:35.134
I mean there's no way you coulda
expected someone to rob us.

1581
01:10:35.134 --> 01:10:36.884
That's some bullshit.

1582
01:10:42.713 --> 01:10:46.657
- Still man. my parents put me in charge.

1583
01:10:46.657 --> 01:10:48.174
And look what happened.

1584
01:10:48.174 --> 01:10:51.232
We're gonna be dead in a couple hours.

1585
01:10:51.232 --> 01:10:55.062
I'm just. I'm sorry I got
you mixed up in all this.

1586
01:10:55.062 --> 01:10:58.562
I just. you know. I should've listen. man.

1587
01:11:00.252 --> 01:11:05.169
- Bro. I've known you pretty
much my entire life. you know?

1588
01:11:07.478 --> 01:11:08.985
I mean. you're the one who
convinced me to try weed

1589
01:11:08.985 --> 01:11:11.486
for the first time. you
remember that. you know?

1590
01:11:11.486 --> 01:11:13.471
I mean. if we die tonight.
we're going down together. man.

1591
01:11:13.471 --> 01:11:15.343
Fuck that shit.

1592
01:11:15.343 --> 01:11:16.681
Gotcha.
- Love you. bro.

1593
01:11:16.681 --> 01:11:17.827
- Love you. bro.

1594
01:11:17.827 --> 01:11:19.493
- Here you go.
- Last one of the night.

1595
01:11:19.493 --> 01:11:21.524
- Thank you. have a good night.

1596
01:11:21.524 --> 01:11:23.116
- Sir?
- Oh. hey. what's up?

1597
01:11:23.116 --> 01:11:23.949
How's it going?

1598
01:11:23.949 --> 01:11:28.199
- Hey. I'm sorry. we're
actually closing right now.

1599
01:11:29.417 --> 01:11:30.917
- Are you serious?

1600
01:11:32.414 --> 01:11:35.224
Houston. we have a problem.

1601
01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:38.414
I really need one of those
space pizzas from earlier.

1602
01:11:38.414 --> 01:11:42.649
That thing is like
intergalactic. mind blowing.

1603
01:11:42.649 --> 01:11:44.816
Isn't it you from earlier?

1604
01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:49.622
- I don't know. but I know
another guy named Bill.

1605
01:11:49.622 --> 01:11:51.115
I can go get him if you want.

1606
01:11:51.115 --> 01:11:53.114
- No. don't do that. don't do that.

1607
01:11:53.114 --> 01:11:54.433
- No?
- No.

1608
01:11:54.433 --> 01:11:55.788
So it's Bill?

1609
01:11:55.788 --> 01:11:59.130
- Oh wait. it is Bill.
(Bill laughs)

1610
01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:00.092
What's your name?

1611
01:12:00.092 --> 01:12:00.925
- I'm Ariel.

1612
01:12:00.925 --> 01:12:02.340
- Ariel. wow.

1613
01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:04.257
You're like that princess from the movies.

1614
01:12:04.257 --> 01:12:07.389
You even look like her a little.

1615
01:12:07.389 --> 01:12:12.222
- You know. Bill. you look so
different from this morning.

1616
01:12:13.165 --> 01:12:15.511
You know these pieces have like
really strong weed in them.

1617
01:12:15.511 --> 01:12:18.619
Like really. really strong.
- What?

1618
01:12:18.619 --> 01:12:20.549
That's fucking awesome.

1619
01:12:20.549 --> 01:12:21.985
I'll take 10.

1620
01:12:21.985 --> 01:12:25.291
- No. see. Bill. we're closing.

1621
01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:27.477
- Huge bummer. dude.
- I know.

1622
01:12:27.477 --> 01:12:28.416
- What?

1623
01:12:28.416 --> 01:12:32.432
I will make you my weed
princess Ariel from the movies.

1624
01:12:32.432 --> 01:12:35.437
- That's actually not a thing.

1625
01:12:35.437 --> 01:12:37.615
- Oh. have a good one kid.

1626
01:12:37.615 --> 01:12:38.448
- Okay.

1627
01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:43.068
- Yo. Shorty.

1628
01:12:43.068 --> 01:12:44.811
now why are we always
watching this place. Shorty?

1629
01:12:44.811 --> 01:12:49.240
because I said so and who the
hell are you to question me?

1630
01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.766
- Why you always got to
be upsetting the man. bro?

1631
01:12:51.766 --> 01:12:53.937
- Man. I just asked him
a question. all right?

1632
01:12:53.937 --> 01:12:56.784
- Yeah. but don't ask stupid questions.

1633
01:12:56.784 --> 01:12:58.393
- How the fuck am I supposed
to know what's stupid

1634
01:12:58.393 --> 01:12:59.873
and not stupid?
- It's common sense. bro.

1635
01:12:59.873 --> 01:13:01.215
- So now I'm the stupid motherfucker

1636
01:13:01.215 --> 01:13:02.213
for not knowing the difference.

1637
01:13:02.213 --> 01:13:03.304
- I ain't calling you stupid.

1638
01:13:03.304 --> 01:13:04.137
I said your questions-
- well it sounds

1639
01:13:04.137 --> 01:13:05.372
like you're fucking calling me stupid.

1640
01:13:05.372 --> 01:13:07.639
- No. I said your question was stupid.

1641
01:13:07.639 --> 01:13:08.472
- Not knowing the difference. right?

1642
01:13:08.472 --> 01:13:10.318
I didn't say that shit.
- Well. you. it sounds like-

1643
01:13:10.318 --> 01:13:11.151
- Yo. both of you shut up.

1644
01:13:11.151 --> 01:13:14.901
before I bounce both
your heads off the wall.

1645
01:13:22.839 --> 01:13:24.045
(knocking on door)

1646
01:13:24.045 --> 01:13:26.044
- Anthony!
- Damn. bro.

1647
01:13:26.044 --> 01:13:27.514
That's crazy Isabella. dude.

1648
01:13:27.514 --> 01:13:28.347
- Yo.

1649
01:13:28.347 --> 01:13:29.730
- Yo. I ditched her
crazy ass one time. bro.

1650
01:13:29.730 --> 01:13:30.989
I thought she was gonna cut my dick off

1651
01:13:30.989 --> 01:13:32.276
after some other chick texted me.

1652
01:13:32.276 --> 01:13:34.080
- Yo. you hit that too. bro?

1653
01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.330
- Bro. come on. who hasn't?

1654
01:13:38.327 --> 01:13:41.068
- Crazy bitch killed my fish. man.

1655
01:13:41.068 --> 01:13:43.188
Yo. I loved that fish. man.

1656
01:13:43.188 --> 01:13:44.041
- Man. who the fuck does that. bro?

1657
01:13:44.041 --> 01:13:45.958
- I don't fucking know.

1658
01:13:47.138 --> 01:13:48.488
- Shorty. is that you?

1659
01:13:48.488 --> 01:13:50.588
You son of a bitch!

1660
01:13:50.588 --> 01:13:51.982
- Shorty-
- That's enough. let's go!

1661
01:13:51.982 --> 01:13:55.815
Let's go.
(suspenseful music)

1662
01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:12.943
- Never leave a dog behind
with his fucking full load.

1663
01:14:12.943 --> 01:14:15.707
'cause his balls will explode.

1664
01:14:15.707 --> 01:14:17.941
Shit. you two looked blazed.

1665
01:14:17.941 --> 01:14:19.276
Got any left for me?

1666
01:14:19.276 --> 01:14:20.210
- Man. shut up.

1667
01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:22.413
All right? You're in no
position to be asking for shit.

1668
01:14:22.413 --> 01:14:23.632
- What did I do?

1669
01:14:23.632 --> 01:14:24.914
- He knows you told me.

1670
01:14:24.914 --> 01:14:26.068
- But it wasn't my fault.

1671
01:14:26.068 --> 01:14:29.294
- Man. shut up Cujo or
I'll mess you up SA.

1672
01:14:29.294 --> 01:14:30.732
- Bitch. I'll bite your dick off.

1673
01:14:30.732 --> 01:14:32.940
- Bitch. you know you want
this dick in your mouth?

1674
01:14:32.940 --> 01:14:35.219
- Man. both of you shut up. all right?

1675
01:14:35.219 --> 01:14:39.001
Let's just go see how much money we have.

1676
01:14:39.001 --> 01:14:42.001
(melancholic music)

1677
01:14:50.364 --> 01:14:55.031
- Come on.
(speaks in foreign language)

1678
01:14:57.036 --> 01:15:00.202
- Yeah. there it is.
- Take it in deeper.

1679
01:15:00.202 --> 01:15:02.307
- I can't go any further.

1680
01:15:02.307 --> 01:15:04.065
- [Woman] Feels good?

1681
01:15:04.065 --> 01:15:06.873
- I don't know if I like it.

1682
01:15:06.873 --> 01:15:10.177
I like it.
- I knew you'd like it.

1683
01:15:10.177 --> 01:15:13.418
- It's starting to hurt.
- Pull your tongue for two.

1684
01:15:13.418 --> 01:15:15.557
- Yeah. yeah. it's in. oh yeah.

1685
01:15:15.557 --> 01:15:17.387
Oh.
- Oh yeah.

1686
01:15:17.387 --> 01:15:18.829
- Gus. what the fuck?

1687
01:15:18.829 --> 01:15:20.249
- What're you guys doing here so late?

1688
01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:21.082
- You know what those things are?

1689
01:15:21.082 --> 01:15:22.209
They're meant to head up your ass!

1690
01:15:22.209 --> 01:15:23.042
- Nothing!

1691
01:15:24.113 --> 01:15:25.402
- Daddy's here. baby. show me that sweet.

1692
01:15:25.402 --> 01:15:27.981
- Hey. who are you and what
did you do with Charlie?

1693
01:15:27.981 --> 01:15:29.473
(woman moaning)

1694
01:15:29.473 --> 01:15:31.167
- Hey. man. my eyes have been opened

1695
01:15:31.167 --> 01:15:33.716
to a whole new world.
- Yeah. whatever.

1696
01:15:33.716 --> 01:15:34.847
Let's just do this.

1697
01:15:34.847 --> 01:15:36.962
- Well. what about-
- Who cares. man?

1698
01:15:36.962 --> 01:15:37.851
All right. just do it.

1699
01:15:37.851 --> 01:15:40.601
(dramatic music)

1700
01:15:45.190 --> 01:15:47.385
- Christ on a bike.
what's all that money for?

1701
01:15:47.385 --> 01:15:49.302
- It's long story. Gus.

1702
01:15:54.010 --> 01:15:55.177
Seriously man.

1703
01:15:57.653 --> 01:15:58.986
Okay. that's 10.

1704
01:16:03.381 --> 01:16:04.858
- No way.

1705
01:16:04.858 --> 01:16:06.441
- How short are we?

1706
01:16:08.023 --> 01:16:12.025
- We have $20.175. oh
shit. man. we did it.

1707
01:16:12.025 --> 01:16:13.139
- What?
- We did it!

1708
01:16:13.139 --> 01:16:14.271
- Oh. you did good!
(upbeat music)

1709
01:16:14.271 --> 01:16:16.427
(knocking at the door)
- Oh. we're closed!

1710
01:16:16.427 --> 01:16:19.227
(knocking continues)

1711
01:16:19.227 --> 01:16:20.394
We are closed!

1712
01:16:21.346 --> 01:16:23.157
(knocking continues)

1713
01:16:23.157 --> 01:16:24.500
I said we're fucking closed!

1714
01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:27.152
(knocking continues)
- Dammit. I'll handle it.

1715
01:16:27.152 --> 01:16:28.569
- Handle it. dog.

1716
01:16:29.716 --> 01:16:30.979
- Dou feel better?

1717
01:16:30.979 --> 01:16:32.246
- Yeah.

1718
01:16:32.246 --> 01:16:35.552
- I threw in $800 from my savings account.

1719
01:16:35.552 --> 01:16:37.411
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

1720
01:16:37.411 --> 01:16:38.864
- You didn't have to do that.

1721
01:16:38.864 --> 01:16:40.376
- No. I wanted to.

1722
01:16:40.376 --> 01:16:43.326
Besides you owe me a date.

1723
01:16:43.326 --> 01:16:44.659
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1724
01:16:47.096 --> 01:16:51.225
(door opening)
- Some of the last.

1725
01:16:51.225 --> 01:16:53.892
- Guys.
- Ooh. shit fucking jazz.

1726
01:16:54.726 --> 01:16:56.372
Yes. I told you this
place was vacant. baby.

1727
01:16:56.372 --> 01:16:57.981
- Yeah. you did say that shit.

1728
01:16:57.981 --> 01:16:59.474
your eyes are so big.
- Put your cargo wearing ass

1729
01:16:59.474 --> 01:17:02.161
over there. put the damn money in the bag!

1730
01:17:02.161 --> 01:17:03.680
- Man. I ain't giving you shit.

1731
01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.350
- Oh. He say he ain't giving me no shit?

1732
01:17:06.350 --> 01:17:07.936
- I think he said-
- Man it's so unfair.

1733
01:17:07.936 --> 01:17:08.907
- Look. you got two choices.

1734
01:17:08.907 --> 01:17:11.022
you can either put the cash in the bag

1735
01:17:11.022 --> 01:17:14.268
or you can give me that ass. sweetie.

1736
01:17:14.268 --> 01:17:16.340
- Man. what's going on with you?

1737
01:17:16.340 --> 01:17:17.260
- Pop off. man.

1738
01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:18.372
- Pop one?
- Pop off.

1739
01:17:18.372 --> 01:17:19.205
- Two or one?

1740
01:17:19.205 --> 01:17:21.256
- Pop the fuck up.
(gun firing)

1741
01:17:21.256 --> 01:17:23.610
- Shit. all you had to
do is ask nicely. God.

1742
01:17:23.610 --> 01:17:24.778
And say please.

1743
01:17:24.778 --> 01:17:29.519
- And don't nobody fucking
call the fucking police either.

1744
01:17:29.519 --> 01:17:32.668
- You took your mask off.
- What the fuck?

1745
01:17:32.668 --> 01:17:33.801
- Yeah.
- Get the fuck outta here.

1746
01:17:33.801 --> 01:17:35.522
- Okay. yeah. yeah. fuck the police!

1747
01:17:35.522 --> 01:17:37.580
Get the fuck out of here.
- I penned your name.

1748
01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.026
- Ugh. did we just get robbed

1749
01:17:39.026 --> 01:17:41.859
by terrible hip hop cover artists?

1750
01:17:43.953 --> 01:17:45.730
- Dammit. man.

1751
01:17:45.730 --> 01:17:46.865
- They're gone.

1752
01:17:46.865 --> 01:17:48.621
I can't see 'em anywhere.

1753
01:17:48.621 --> 01:17:50.511
- Fuck.
- Freaking gangsters.

1754
01:17:50.511 --> 01:17:52.427
- Who cares. man?

1755
01:17:52.427 --> 01:17:53.862
- What the hell are you doing man?

1756
01:17:53.862 --> 01:17:54.695
What're you doing?

1757
01:17:54.695 --> 01:17:57.187
- If I'm gonna die. I'm not dying sober.

1758
01:17:57.187 --> 01:17:59.461
- Why are you talking about dying?

1759
01:17:59.461 --> 01:18:01.511
- Hey. you know what? Forget all that.

1760
01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:03.863
How long have you been
jacking off in my office. Gus?

1761
01:18:03.863 --> 01:18:06.582
- Four months.
- Every day?

1762
01:18:06.582 --> 01:18:07.415
- Yeah.

1763
01:18:07.415 --> 01:18:11.196
- Dude. if we survive
today. I'm firing you. okay?

1764
01:18:11.196 --> 01:18:13.251
- But I had the best intentions.

1765
01:18:13.251 --> 01:18:14.819
I. you wouldn't get the camera fixed

1766
01:18:14.819 --> 01:18:16.961
so I installed a motion detector camera.

1767
01:18:16.961 --> 01:18:19.790
And you know. I figured I'd
use a channel on my girlfriend.

1768
01:18:19.790 --> 01:18:22.386
- Last week I thought
somebody dropped a glaze donut

1769
01:18:22.386 --> 01:18:23.338
on my carpet.

1770
01:18:23.338 --> 01:18:25.528
Turns out the stain is
from your dick juice?

1771
01:18:25.528 --> 01:18:26.886
- I said. I was sorry.

1772
01:18:26.886 --> 01:18:28.922
What do you want from me?

1773
01:18:28.922 --> 01:18:30.878
- Kiss my ass. Gus.
- Wait. hold on. hold on.

1774
01:18:30.878 --> 01:18:32.716
Did you just say that
the web camera records

1775
01:18:32.716 --> 01:18:34.767
once the motion detectors
have been activated?

1776
01:18:34.767 --> 01:18:36.155
- Yeah. I can pull it up on my computer

1777
01:18:36.155 --> 01:18:37.532
or my phone either or.

1778
01:18:37.532 --> 01:18:38.648
- Dude. pull it out right now!

1779
01:18:38.648 --> 01:18:40.346
- Guys. come on.
- Follow you.

1780
01:18:40.346 --> 01:18:41.679
- [Gus] Come on.

1781
01:18:43.105 --> 01:18:45.762
What are you guys looking for?

1782
01:18:45.762 --> 01:18:47.262
- Let me see that.

1783
01:18:51.147 --> 01:18:52.897
Who the fuck is that?

1784
01:19:04.202 --> 01:19:06.367
- Shit. man. it was Shorty
this whole fucking time.

1785
01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:09.597
- Boy. I'm gonna break my
foot off in his asshole.

1786
01:19:09.597 --> 01:19:11.163
- Does this still mean I'm fired?

1787
01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:16.163
(knocking at the door)
(suspenseful music)

1788
01:19:18.745 --> 01:19:19.762
- What's up man?

1789
01:19:19.762 --> 01:19:21.089
- What's up fellas?

1790
01:19:21.089 --> 01:19:22.963
Looks like we meet again. huh?

1791
01:19:22.963 --> 01:19:23.963
Search them.

1792
01:19:24.859 --> 01:19:26.005
- What the hell man?
- Arms up.

1793
01:19:26.005 --> 01:19:27.422
- Dude. language.

1794
01:19:32.653 --> 01:19:34.731
- Yeah. we thought we'd make
it easy on you guys. man.

1795
01:19:34.731 --> 01:19:36.089
Where's the money?

1796
01:19:36.089 --> 01:19:37.860
- Look. man. we don't have your money.

1797
01:19:37.860 --> 01:19:39.197
- What do you mean you don't have it?

1798
01:19:39.197 --> 01:19:41.860
- Man. does he stutter? We don't
have your money. all right?

1799
01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:42.693
Ow!

1800
01:19:42.693 --> 01:19:44.345
- [Altogether] Hey. hey. hey. hey.

1801
01:19:44.345 --> 01:19:46.583
- Look. we got robbed. okay? Again.

1802
01:19:46.583 --> 01:19:49.556
- You two idiots must
take us for fools. huh?

1803
01:19:49.556 --> 01:19:52.031
Either you two pieces of
shit are fucking liars

1804
01:19:52.031 --> 01:19:53.476
or you guys just got
the worst luck in hell.

1805
01:19:53.476 --> 01:19:54.309
Which one is it?

1806
01:19:54.309 --> 01:19:56.672
- Look. man. we know Playa
Playa doesn't play. okay?

1807
01:19:56.672 --> 01:19:58.792
(Playa Playa laughs)
Player. Player. man.

1808
01:19:58.792 --> 01:19:59.688
still using that name. huh?

1809
01:19:59.688 --> 01:20:01.104
Letting it float around.

1810
01:20:01.104 --> 01:20:01.963
Let me tell you something. man.

1811
01:20:01.963 --> 01:20:04.462
that name's not on my birth
certificate. you feel me?

1812
01:20:04.462 --> 01:20:05.778
Every time I hear that name.

1813
01:20:05.778 --> 01:20:08.160
man. it gives me this touchy
feeling inside. you know?

1814
01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:09.507
From. from the gut.

1815
01:20:09.507 --> 01:20:10.340
- Oh. have you ever thought

1816
01:20:10.340 --> 01:20:12.073
about changing it up
a little bit you know?

1817
01:20:12.073 --> 01:20:14.451
- Yeah. actually I have.

1818
01:20:14.451 --> 01:20:16.591
It's about 350 miles off the coast.

1819
01:20:16.591 --> 01:20:18.338
It's a nice little Caribbean spot.

1820
01:20:18.338 --> 01:20:19.261
Was thinking about putting
in Italian restaurant.

1821
01:20:19.261 --> 01:20:21.834
(Shorty whispers)
Yeah. whatever.

1822
01:20:21.834 --> 01:20:23.069
Let me tell you guys something. man.

1823
01:20:23.069 --> 01:20:25.800
Business is business and money's money.

1824
01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:26.633
- Woo.

1825
01:20:26.633 --> 01:20:28.029

- Who the fuck stole it then. huh?

1830
01:20:33.455 --> 01:20:35.738
- This karate pirate motherfucker you got

1831
01:20:35.738 --> 01:20:37.194
as a sidekick. that's who.

1832
01:20:37.194 --> 01:20:39.067
- What you talking about
man. is that true. Shorty?

1833
01:20:39.067 --> 01:20:39.900
- Hell no.

1834
01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.035

Okay. Gus.

01:20:45.201 --> 01:20:48.104
- Password two. two. three. five.

1838
01:20:48.104 --> 01:20:49.216
- Hey. this is bullshit.

1839
01:20:49.216 --> 01:20:51.867
- Now. shut the fuck up. relax man.

1840
01:20:51.867 --> 01:20:54.496
Let me check it out for myself. man.

1841
01:20:54.496 --> 01:20:55.329
Push play.

What the fuck. Shorty?

1843
01:20:59.209 --> 01:21:00.304
- Fuck you.

1844
01:21:00.304 --> 01:21:02.179
That's what it's about.

1845
01:21:02.179 --> 01:21:04.072
You're getting soft.

1846
01:21:04.072 --> 01:21:05.678
My turn to run the show.

1847
01:21:05.678 --> 01:21:06.670
You ain't running shit. man.

1848
01:21:06.670 --> 01:21:08.076
- Hey. hey. hey.

1849
01:21:08.076 --> 01:21:09.940
Be not afraid of greatness.

1850
01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:11.207
Some are born great.

1851
01:21:11.207 --> 01:21:13.546
And some have greatness upon them.

1852
01:21:13.546 --> 01:21:15.834

1853
01:21:15.834 --> 01:21:17.563
This how want the final chapter?

01:21:19.983 --> 01:21:21.238
