- Baby.
- (laughs) Yeah?

51
00:03:22.432 --> 00:03:24.239

- Yeah. it is.

63
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:02.361
(Rebecca chuckles)

64
00:04:02.361 --> 00:04:04.530
You know. we should do this
with Paul and Danielle sometime.

65
00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.210
Like a. Like a couples getaway.

66
00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.490
- Yeah. it's a good idea.

67
00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.583
But I'm glad that we get
to do this together first.

68
00:04:12.777 --> 00:04:13.710
- Mm?
- Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.543
- Me too.

70
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.357
Wait. should we break
in every room as we go?

71
00:04:21.357 --> 00:04:23.940
- Ooh. is that a challenge?
- Maybe.

72
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.764
- Maybe after you make a proper
cocktail. we can discuss.

73
00:04:26.764 --> 00:04:28.980
- (laughs) Wait. wait.
are you extorting me

74
00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.840
for my cocktail making abilities?

75
00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.700
- That's kinda the only
reason we're together.

76
00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.453
- Is it?
(Rebecca laughs)

77
00:04:35.453 --> 00:04:37.380
(John sighs)

78
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.213
- Mm.

79
00:04:39.164 --> 00:04:41.520
- (exhales sharply) I love it up here.

80
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.363
- Yeah. me too.

81
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.810
Isn't there another bedroom downstairs?

82
00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.640
- Yeah. there's a few.

83
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.653
- Let's check 'em out.
- All right.

84
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.520
- Didn't realize this
place had so many bedrooms.

85
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.410
- Yeah. it's not bad.

86
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.790
Should I go grab our bags?

87
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.964
- No. let's just chill and
have a drink for a bit.

88
00:04:59.964 --> 00:05:02.003

where you put the speaker?

92
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.020
- Oh. it's in your backpack.

93
00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:19.223
- Okay.

94
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.623
What'll it be?

95
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.097
- Um. surprise me.

00:05:39.027 --> 00:05:40.677
- Ah. always makes me wanna cook.

102
00:05:42.345 --> 00:05:45.111
(gasps) Should I get started on dinner?

103
00:05:45.111 --> 00:05:46.694
- That'd be great.

00:05:47.988 --> 00:05:49.927

whatever you wanna call me.

115
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.340
I just live up the way.
I saw you guys drive in.

116
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:17.910
so I wanted to come introduce myself

117
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.570
and let you know that I'm
here should you need anything.

118
00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:26.100
- All right. um. yeah.

119
00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.794

And again. I'm really sorry
I didn't mean to scare you.

126
00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.053
- No. it's. it's fine. man. really.

127
00:06:40.897 --> 00:06:41.730
- You know what?

128
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.390
It looks like you guys are
running low on firewood.

129
00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:46.620
How about I chop you some?

130
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:48.360

Come on. I don't wanna
get off on the wrong foot.

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.700
Let me do this for you.
it'll make me feel better.

133
00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.050
Listen. I won't even bother you.

134
00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:56.900
I'll just leave it by the front door.

135
00:06:58.496 --> 00:06:59.329
- Uh.

136
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.160

138
00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.020
- Really. it's nothing at all.

139
00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:10.170
Y'all enjoy your stay now.
(suspenseful music)

140

- Thanks. again.
(door squeaking)

141
00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:23.850
- Were you talking to someone?

142
00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:28.830
- Yeah. it's just a really
creepy old groundskeeper guy.

143
00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.360
- Oh.
- Scared the shit out of me.

144
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:32.780
- (chuckles) What did he want?

145
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.410
- (sighs) Nothing really.

146
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:36.860
he was just welcoming us
and introducing himself.

147
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:39.600
- Weird.
- Hm.

148
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.240
Uh. anyways. what all do

(birds chirping)

159
00:08:11.177 --> 00:08:15.420
- Okay. how about you go sit down. relax.

160
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:17.280
and pick out whatever terrifying movie

161
00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.780
you're gonna make us watch tonight.

162
00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.750
- Hey. this is not solely my tradition.

163
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:24.150
Okay. I don't like it anymore than you do.

164
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.618
- So then why do we do this to ourselves?

165
00:08:26.618 --> 00:08:28.354
- (sighs) It's just what do we do. honey.

166
00:08:28.354 --> 00:08:30.393
- (laughs) Ooh.

167
00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:32.183

Here. move it. I'll get it.

169

I know how sensitive you are with onions.

170
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:39.388
- Mm. thank you.

171
00:08:39.388 --> 00:08:41.040

- Hey. should I make us a cocktail?

173
00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:45.390
- Yes. please. uh. I didn't
bring the bar in yet though.

174
00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.500

185
00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:44.670
How about a martini?

186

Mm-hmm.

188
00:09:49.527 --> 00:09:52.290
- Although. being up
in the woods like this

189
00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:54.420
does put me in the mood
for a whiskey something.

190
00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.960

for a whiskey something.

277
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.030
in their press release that the decision

278
00:14:09.030 --> 00:14:10.980
to increase the budget
has allowed to rebuild

279
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:13.350

282
00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:18.600
The opposition party had run a campaign

283
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:21.300
for the measure to be assessed
to prevent more accidents

284
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.220

The mayor allegedly ordered the variation

to contrast the growing popularity
of the opposition leader

291
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:37.980

319

I'll just pile this wood
up and I'll be on my way.

320

- It's okay. you just
caught me off guard is all.

321
00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.440
- [Ben] Well. that was not my intention.

322
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.510
I saw your car drive down the road.

323
00:16:30.510 --> 00:16:32.910
so I assumed that you
guys would both be out

324
00:16:32.910 --> 00:16:36.390
and that this would be a good
time to drop the wood off.

325
00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:39.033
- Yeah. no. that makes perfect sense.

326
00:16:40.110 --> 00:16:42.638

329
00:16:46.253 --> 00:16:49.023
I just. I cut myself cooking dinner.

here that wanna kill you.

334
00:16:57.630 --> 00:16:59.433
you should get that cleaned up.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:07.623

338
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.580

run home and grab some stuff

339

340

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.200
- All right. no trouble at all.

353
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.500
- Okay. Thanks. again.
- Yeah. I'll see you around.

354
00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.633
- Bye.

(upbeat music)
(artist vocalizing)

357
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.080
- [News Reporter] Back to your
favorite local radio station.

358
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.580
This is still Quote Robinson here

359
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.470
with my fellow community citizens.

360
00:18:13.470 --> 00:18:17.923
It's Friday night.
(gentle suspenseful music)

361
00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:24.540
As in the rest of the country.
we are officially in summer.

362
00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:26.910
As a matter of fact. it's
been a hot summer already.

363
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.020
and it looks like we're going to have

364
00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:29.730
a very long summer this year.

365
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.670
Let's keep updating you on the
unusual tropical situation.

366
00:18:32.670 --> 00:18:34.860
which is predicted to reach
the peak next weekend.

367
00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:36.750
Tomorrow. Sunday. and Monday.

368
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:37.920
we're going to track the skies

369
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.780
given the monsoon moisture from the south.

370
00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:44.280
Some areas may-
(suspenseful music)

371
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.860
Of 71 and a maximum of 79

372
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:49.860
with sky conditions that
were almost clear and silent.

373
00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.810
We're warning you though.
the temperature will drop

374
00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:54.870
to a minimum of 65 and a maximum of 72

375
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.180
on Tuesday and Wednesday.
where the chances of rain

376
00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:00.180
will have a peak with
an average 65% of rain.

377
00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:04.153
We will then bounce back to-

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:16.727
(suspenseful music continues)

379
00:19:24.824 --> 00:19:28.741
(suspenseful music continues)

380
00:19:31.148 --> 00:19:34.160
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

381
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.827
(phone tapping)

382
00:19:39.129 --> 00:19:42.129
(dial tone ringing)

383
00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.634
(suspenseful music continues)

384
00:19:50.634 --> 00:19:53.301
(phone ringing)

385
00:19:59.983 --> 00:20:02.100
(phone beeping)
(door clicks)

386
00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.161
- Who is it?

387
00:20:03.161 --> 00:20:05.790
(door squeaks)

388
00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.050
- Who is it?

389
00:20:07.050 --> 00:20:08.783
It's me. who do you think it is?

390
00:20:09.870 --> 00:20:12.690
- Sorry. I just. I got
freaked out a minute ago.

391
00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:14.550
Hey. hey. Whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa.

392
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:16.530
Wait. why do you have a knife?

393
00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:19.974
- 'Cause that creepy
groundskeeper came by.

394
00:20:19.974 --> 00:20:22.680
- (sighs) Dammit. he came
off to drop off the wood.

395
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.793
didn't he?
- Yeah.

396
00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:26.550
And you didn't think to
mention to your fiance.

397
00:20:26.550 --> 00:20:29.490
who was here all alone. that
he might be stopping by. so.

398
00:20:29.490 --> 00:20:31.620
- I'm sorry. I forgot.

399
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.760
All right?
- Yeah. and-

400
00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.110
- I'm sorry you got scared.

401
00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:37.703
- Did you know this
place doesn't have a TV?

402
00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:41.580
- Uh. yeah. yeah. yeah.

403
00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.410
I realized that when I got here.

404
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.423
but. uh. you have your laptop. right?

405
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:47.633
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

406
00:20:49.636 --> 00:20:51.660
- (sighs) I'm sorry. I
just got really scared.

407
00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:53.610
I mean. he like came by the kitchen window

408
00:20:53.610 --> 00:20:56.460
when I was at the sink and
just like came out of nowhere.

409
00:20:56.460 --> 00:20:58.337
- Came by the kitchen
sink.. why didn't he.

410
00:20:58.337 --> 00:20:59.495
why didn't he go to the front door?

411
00:20:59.495 --> 00:21:01.260
- He. he thought that we had left together

412
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:04.103
when you went to go get pasta
so he didn't know I was here.

413
00:21:07.775 --> 00:21:09.832
- Hey. hey. what's this?

414
00:21:09.832 --> 00:21:11.100
- Oh. nothing. I just cut myself

415
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.780
when I was cook-
- Nothing. let me see.

416
00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:13.780
- It's not that bad.

417
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:18.540
- Baby!
- It's not that bad.

418
00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.700
- Not that bad? You almost
cut your finger off.

419
00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.600
- You're ridiculous.

420
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.740
- Did you clean it?

421
00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:24.756
- I just ran water over it.

422
00:21:24.756 --> 00:21:25.728
(John sighs)

423
00:21:25.728 --> 00:21:27.720
- (speaks faintly) All right.
look. I'm gonna get some stuff

424
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.873
and I'm gonna clean it
up for you. all right?

425
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.281
Or at least pour some whiskey over it.

426
00:21:33.281 --> 00:21:36.031
(Rebecca laughs)

427
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:39.060
- You could take the boy out of the south.

428
00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:42.423
- Hey. I heard that.
(Rebecca laughs)

429
00:21:43.722 --> 00:21:48.130
(Rebecca exhales sharply)
(suspenseful music)

430
00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:51.797
(Rebecca breathing heavily)

431
00:21:57.831 --> 00:22:02.831
(suspenseful music continues)
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

432
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:07.383
- (sighs) Okay.

433
00:22:07.383 --> 00:22:10.943
All right.
(cupboard doors thud)

434
00:22:10.943 --> 00:22:12.453
(Rebecca groans)

435
00:22:12.453 --> 00:22:15.420
Oh. come on. it's not
gonna hurt. all right?

436
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.816
Plus. we know what the
whiskey's really for. right?

437
00:22:17.816 --> 00:22:21.181
- (chuckles) Okay. fine.
let's just get it over with.

438
00:22:21.181 --> 00:22:23.140
- Okay. one second.

439
00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.900
- Wait. should we trust that?

440
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:25.953
Is it expired?

441
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.363
Do I even care?
- It's fine. It's fine.

442
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.170
All right. just a little bit

443
00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:36.837
to make sure you don't get an infection.

444
00:22:36.837 --> 00:22:38.123
You ready?
- Yeah.

445
00:22:39.541 --> 00:22:41.460
(Rebecca groans)
- Oh. you're okay.

446
00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:42.842
- Uh-uh.

447
00:22:42.842 --> 00:22:46.621
- All good.
(Rebecca breathing heavily)

448
00:22:46.621 --> 00:22:47.454
All right.

449
00:22:48.447 --> 00:22:50.910
Now just a quick bandaid. you'll be good.

450
00:22:52.185 --> 00:22:53.018
- Okay.

451
00:22:54.780 --> 00:22:56.283
- All right. good as new.

452
00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.460
Although. I don't know if you
should be drinking alcohol.

453
00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:04.230
you know. it's a blood thinner.

454
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:05.730
I should probably finish this for you.

455
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.070
- Well. in that case.
(John chuckles)

456
00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:08.903
Doctor Taylor

457
00:23:10.230 --> 00:23:12.210
can go fuck himself.

458
00:23:12.210 --> 00:23:13.770
- Wow. whoa.
- Mm.

459
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:14.763
- Little harsh.

460
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.675
You know this house is expecting sex

461
00:23:17.675 --> 00:23:18.690
- Mm.
- and we wouldn't wanna

462
00:23:18.690 --> 00:23:20.440
disappoint the house now. would we?

463
00:23:22.011 --> 00:23:23.594
- Patience. Doctor.

464
00:23:25.010 --> 00:23:25.843
- Okay.

465
00:23:28.083 --> 00:23:30.833
(water burbling)

466
00:23:32.675 --> 00:23:35.425
(pasta rustling)

467
00:23:37.795 --> 00:23:39.295
- Okay. so.
- Yeah.

468
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:43.800
we have about nine minutes
before the pasta's ready.

469
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.479
Um. so in the meantime we could...

470
00:23:46.479 --> 00:23:49.470
- So. what could we do in nine minutes?

471
00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.446
Is that what you're asking?
(Rebecca laughs)

472
00:23:51.446 --> 00:23:53.067
Huh?
- You're such a perv.

473
00:23:53.067 --> 00:23:55.020
- Oh. come on. you should appreciate

474
00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.065
my completely appropriate
level of perviness.

475
00:23:58.065 --> 00:23:59.400
- Hey.
- That's where we're at.

476
00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.570
- Mm.

477
00:24:00.570 --> 00:24:02.733
For you. yes.

478
00:24:03.991 --> 00:24:06.619
- Huh. you like it.
- Hmm.

479
00:24:06.619 --> 00:24:08.340
Shut up. John.

480
00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.073
Or you could shut me up.

481
00:24:12.570 --> 00:24:14.670
Let's see if you can make it nine minutes.

482
00:24:20.031 --> 00:24:23.614
(gentle suspenseful music)

483
00:24:26.723 --> 00:24:29.806
(suspenseful music)

484
00:24:36.886 --> 00:24:41.518
(suspenseful music continues)

485
00:24:41.518 --> 00:24:44.760
(Rebecca exhales sharply)
(John breathes heavily)

486
00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.460
So. (clears throat)

487
00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:49.590
still got about six minutes
before the pasta's done.

488
00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:50.763
- No way.
- Yeah.

489
00:24:52.213 --> 00:24:54.063
(Rebecca laughs)
- Oh my gosh. shit.

490
00:24:54.930 --> 00:24:57.682
Shut up.
(Rebecca laughs)

491
00:24:57.682 --> 00:25:00.379
(car alarm blaring)

492
00:25:00.379 --> 00:25:01.879
- Is that the car?

493
00:25:06.564 --> 00:25:09.681
(car alarm continues blaring)

494
00:25:09.681 --> 00:25:12.764
(suspenseful music)

495
00:25:14.237 --> 00:25:16.570
(car beeps)

496
00:25:18.093 --> 00:25:18.926
- Stay here.

497
00:25:20.299 --> 00:25:21.399
I'm sure it's nothing.

498
00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.830
- Oh. I'm not going anywhere.

499
00:25:32.795 --> 00:25:36.712
(suspenseful music continues)

500
00:25:38.421 --> 00:25:42.254
(dramatic suspenseful music)

501
00:25:45.690 --> 00:25:46.540
- The car's fine.

502
00:25:48.090 --> 00:25:50.340
I'm sure it was just a squirrel.

503
00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.180
Nothing to worry about.

504
00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:52.560
- Okay. I'm gonna go drain the pasta

505
00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.210
so it doesn't get sticky.

506
00:25:54.210 --> 00:25:55.043
Come on.

507
00:25:57.856 --> 00:26:00.551
(suspenseful music)
(door squeaks)

508
00:26:00.551 --> 00:26:02.651
(branches rustling)

509
00:26:02.651 --> 00:26:05.734
(footsteps rustling)

510
00:26:11.433 --> 00:26:15.266
(dramatic suspenseful music)

511
00:26:21.891 --> 00:26:24.974
(suspenseful music)

512
00:26:32.846 --> 00:26:36.763
(suspenseful music continues)

513
00:26:40.814 --> 00:26:45.814
(metal clanking)
(water spattering)

514
00:26:50.858 --> 00:26:54.775
(suspenseful music continues)

515
00:27:01.864 --> 00:27:05.781
(suspenseful music continues)

516
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:10.167
(water spattering)

517
00:27:16.655 --> 00:27:18.813
(dramatic suspenseful music)

518
00:27:18.813 --> 00:27:22.204
(suspenseful music)

519
00:27:22.204 --> 00:27:23.037
John.

520
00:27:23.878 --> 00:27:24.943
dinner's ready.

521
00:27:24.943 --> 00:27:29.443
(water spattering)
- I'll be right up.

522
00:27:31.126 --> 00:27:33.638
(John speaking faintly)

523
00:27:33.638 --> 00:27:37.138
- [Rebecca] What are you doing down there?

524
00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:40.320
Baby?

525
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.490
- Yeah?

526
00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:42.810
- [Rebecca] What's up?

527
00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:45.030
- Nothing. there's a pipe leaking.

528
00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:46.740
I'll notify the owner in the morning.

529
00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.690
- Okay. well. come up and eat

530
00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:50.850
because the pasta's getting cold.

531
00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:52.470
Gotta watch a movie.

532
00:27:52.470 --> 00:27:54.203
- Yeah. I'll be right up.
- Okay.

533
00:27:57.554 --> 00:28:01.387
(dramatic suspenseful music)

534
00:28:03.871 --> 00:28:06.693
So what kinda wine did you get?

535
00:28:07.652 --> 00:28:10.119
- (sighs) Pinot Noir. of course.

536
00:28:10.119 --> 00:28:11.910
(Rebecca sighs)
Come on. it's your favorite.

537
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:14.616
- Yes.
- All right. you ready?

538
00:28:14.616 --> 00:28:17.040
- Um. am I gonna hate it?

539
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.810
- Probably. yeah.

540
00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:19.860
- Okay.
- All right.

541
00:28:23.234 --> 00:28:26.901
(gentle suspenseful music)

542
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:37.500
- I already hate it.
- Oh. come on.

543
00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.000
Give it a chance.

544
00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.413
- I will. I will. I'm sorry.

545
00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.850
Next time I pick a movie.

546
00:28:44.850 --> 00:28:48.780
- [John] Hey. these old school
horror movies are classic.

547
00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:50.820
- Do you remember one
time when we were small.

548
00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:52.500
we were out here?

549
00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.330
It was from right over there.

550
00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:56.280
I jumped out at you from behind the tree

551
00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.690
and grandpa got all excited

552
00:28:57.690 --> 00:28:59.077
and he shook his fist at me and he said.

553
00:28:59.077 --> 00:29:02.160
"Boy. you'll be damned to hell." (laughs)

554
00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.760
Remember that? Right over there.

555
00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:06.890
Well. you used to really be scared here.

556
00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:09.420
- Johnny.

557
00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:11.310
- Oh. you're still afraid.

558
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:12.693
- Stop it now. I mean it.

559
00:29:17.137 --> 00:29:20.010
- They're coming to get you. Barbara.

560
00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:22.350
- [Barbara] Stop it! You're ignorant.

561
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:25.290
- [Johnny] They're
coming for you. Barbara.

562
00:29:25.290 --> 00:29:27.330
- [Barbara] Stop it.
you're acting like a child.

563
00:29:27.330 --> 00:29:29.489
- What an asshole.
- They're coming for you.

564
00:29:29.489 --> 00:29:31.140
(Rebecca gasps)
Look. there comes

565
00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:32.343
one of them now.

566
00:29:33.573 --> 00:29:34.640
- He'll hear you!
- I hope this movie

567
00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.000
gets better.
- It will.

568
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.110
- I'm getting out of here.
- Johnny!

569
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:39.029
- I'm relatively sure it does.
(Rebecca chuckles)

570
00:29:39.029 --> 00:29:42.696
(gentle suspenseful music)

571
00:29:45.210 --> 00:29:47.676
- Help!
- Boom!

572
00:29:47.676 --> 00:29:48.756
- Jesus.
- Johnny.

573
00:29:48.756 --> 00:29:50.601
help me!
(Rebecca chuckles)

574
00:29:50.601 --> 00:29:53.684
(suspenseful music)

575
00:29:58.534 --> 00:30:03.534
(wall thudding)
(Johnny grunting)

576
00:30:06.770 --> 00:30:09.270
(suspenseful music)

577
00:30:09.270 --> 00:30:10.103
- John.

578
00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:12.143
what's that noise?

579
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.760
- It must be the pipe.

580
00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:19.440
- Fuck. that's ridiculous.

581
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.060
- Well. look. the pipes
are right below us.

582
00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:22.710
right. you're gonna hear it.

583
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:24.090
- Are you sure?

584
00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:24.923
- Yes.

585
00:30:26.070 --> 00:30:26.903
Calm down.

586
00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.936
- Calm down. you calm down. Fuck.

587
00:30:30.936 --> 00:30:33.139
(suspenseful music)

588
00:30:33.139 --> 00:30:36.639
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

589
00:30:43.715 --> 00:30:48.715
(suspenseful music)
(footsteps plodding)

590
00:30:56.857 --> 00:30:58.855
(suspenseful music)

591
00:30:58.855 --> 00:31:01.174
Remind me why we do this to ourselves.

592
00:31:01.174 --> 00:31:03.690
- [John] Hey. I think you're
still just a little creeped out

593
00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:05.390
from the grounds keeper guy today.

594
00:31:07.374 --> 00:31:09.624
- [Rebecca] Yeah. probably.

595
00:31:12.437 --> 00:31:14.633
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

596
00:31:14.633 --> 00:31:17.238
Finally a reasonable
choice from this chick.

597
00:31:17.238 --> 00:31:19.770
- [John] Yeah. see.
she ain't that useless.

598
00:31:19.770 --> 00:31:20.870
- [Rebecca] We'll see.

599
00:31:23.681 --> 00:31:26.514
(Barbara screams)

600
00:31:28.262 --> 00:31:31.491
- [John] Yeah. but if this was 1968.

601
00:31:31.491 --> 00:31:34.664
you'd be cuddles up to me.
clenching my arm right now.

602
00:31:34.664 --> 00:31:38.533
- (laughs) Oh. yeah?
- Oh. yeah.

603
00:31:38.533 --> 00:31:43.533
- [Rebecca] And then you would
have your hand on my knee.

604
00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:45.086
- [John] Oh. yeah?

605
00:31:45.086 --> 00:31:47.413
- [Rebecca] Slowly work it up like that.

606
00:31:47.413 --> 00:31:49.175
- [John] And then what?

607
00:31:49.175 --> 00:31:52.253
- [Rebecca] And then
you'd give me a foot rub.

608
00:31:52.253 --> 00:31:54.559
- (laughs) What?
(Rebecca laughs)

609
00:31:54.559 --> 00:31:56.040
A foot rub. is that what I would do?

610
00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:58.241
- Yeah. what were you thinking?

611
00:31:58.241 --> 00:32:00.873
- I was thinking about something else.

612
00:32:00.873 --> 00:32:05.306
- John! (laughs)

613
00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:13.440
Okay. here we go.

614
00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:15.210
I knew it was coming. but now it's on.

615
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.952
- Oh. it's been on for a minute.

616
00:32:16.952 --> 00:32:17.853
(Rebecca laughs)

617
00:32:17.853 --> 00:32:20.936
(suspenseful music)

618
00:32:28.853 --> 00:32:32.770
(suspenseful music continues)

619
00:32:38.170 --> 00:32:39.870
(John sighs)

620
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:41.530
It's nice to get out of LA. huh?

621
00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.623
- So nice.

622
00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.943
It's crazy how you can
see the stars out here.

623
00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:50.463
- Yeah.
- Mm.

624
00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:55.503
The town is so cute too.

625
00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:57.173
- Mm-hmm.

626
00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:01.050
- But it's so crazy how like the stores

627
00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:03.580
are only open like a couple days a week

628
00:33:04.440 --> 00:33:06.361
at really weird times.

629
00:33:06.361 --> 00:33:08.433
- Yeah. it's a family town.

630
00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.870
Get a lot of people come
up here and raise families.

631
00:33:12.870 --> 00:33:14.580
Raise kids.

632
00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:15.413
- Huh?

633
00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:18.713
Yeah.

634
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.950
Hey. remember we gotta get
the stuff out of the car.

635
00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:24.330
- Uh.

636
00:33:24.330 --> 00:33:26.493
yeah. we should do that.

637
00:33:27.517 --> 00:33:28.350
- Okay.

638
00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:30.783
- Want some first?
- Mm.

639
00:33:36.182 --> 00:33:40.254
- (sighs) Okay.
- Okay.

640
00:33:40.254 --> 00:33:43.324
(floorboards creaking)

641
00:33:43.324 --> 00:33:46.407
(footsteps plodding)

642
00:33:52.547 --> 00:33:55.130
(door squeaks)

643
00:34:03.432 --> 00:34:05.040
(zip zipping)

644
00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:06.240
- I'm gonna brush my teeth really quick.

645
00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.304
- Okay. I'm gonna change first.

646
00:34:10.304 --> 00:34:14.056
- Okay.
(Rebecca groans)

647
00:34:14.056 --> 00:34:16.734
(Rebecca yawns)

648
00:34:16.734 --> 00:34:17.567
Ah.

649
00:34:23.555 --> 00:34:25.945
(John yawns)

650
00:34:25.945 --> 00:34:27.087
(John groans)

651
00:34:27.087 --> 00:34:29.837
(water sloshing)

652
00:34:36.039 --> 00:34:37.673
(gentle suspenseful music)

653
00:34:37.673 --> 00:34:41.173
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

654
00:34:42.021 --> 00:34:42.854
- No.

655
00:34:45.636 --> 00:34:48.624
(exhales sharply) One.

656
00:34:48.624 --> 00:34:49.457
two.

657
00:34:52.511 --> 00:34:56.066
(Rebecca groans)

658
00:34:56.066 --> 00:34:56.899
Ah.

659
00:34:58.393 --> 00:35:00.323
(water sloshing)

660
00:35:00.323 --> 00:35:01.156
Mm. mm-mm.

661
00:35:02.369 --> 00:35:03.202
Move over.

662
00:35:11.427 --> 00:35:14.273
- So?
- (laughs) Maybe.

663
00:35:14.273 --> 00:35:16.617
- Ah. I'll take a maybe.
(Rebecca laughs)

664
00:35:16.617 --> 00:35:18.333
- Okay. I know you will.

665
00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.561
Hey. what time is it?

666
00:35:21.561 --> 00:35:23.561
- It's like 11:30.
- Mm.

667
00:35:24.804 --> 00:35:25.637
(urine spattering)

668
00:35:25.637 --> 00:35:28.764
- You better put that lid down
before you flush that toilet.

669
00:35:28.764 --> 00:35:32.247
- (laughs) Don't I always?

670
00:35:32.247 --> 00:35:34.925
- You know how many germs fly
up when you flush a toilet?

671
00:35:34.925 --> 00:35:37.800
- (chuckles) Like a million.

672
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:39.493
- I mean. yeah. it's gross.

673
00:35:39.493 --> 00:35:40.680
Like. what do you wanna do.

674
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.284
brush your teeth with a poop toothbrush?

675
00:35:42.284 --> 00:35:44.130
(John laughs)
I don't think so.

676
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:46.260
- Oh my gosh. is this like
some. uh. some fetish thing

677
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:47.093
we should talk about?
- Just-

678
00:35:47.093 --> 00:35:50.580
- Okay. okay. look. I'll flush
the toilet now and forever.

679
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.413
- Thank you.

680
00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.483
- Do you wanna go on
a hike in the morning?

681
00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:59.572
- Do I look like I wanna go
on a hike in the morning?

682
00:35:59.572 --> 00:36:00.930
- (laughs) Well. not yet.

683
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.480
- Mm. and you guessed right.

684
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.891
You either get sex or a hike?

685
00:36:05.891 --> 00:36:09.373
Pick one.
- Ah. (whistles)

686
00:36:09.373 --> 00:36:10.700
Which one do you think I'm gonna choose?

687
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:14.450
- (laughs) I know which one.

688
00:36:15.598 --> 00:36:18.681
(toothbrush buzzing)

689
00:36:22.426 --> 00:36:25.176
(water sloshing)

690
00:36:31.498 --> 00:36:33.282
(ring clinks)

691
00:36:33.282 --> 00:36:38.282
(dramatic suspenseful music)
(clock ticking)

692
00:36:45.793 --> 00:36:50.460
(dramatic suspenseful music continues)

693
00:36:52.652 --> 00:36:55.735
(suspenseful music)

694
00:37:03.924 --> 00:37:07.841
(suspenseful music continues)

695
00:37:15.836 --> 00:37:19.753
(suspenseful music continues)

696
00:37:27.878 --> 00:37:31.795
(suspenseful music continues)

697
00:37:39.849 --> 00:37:43.766
(suspenseful music continues)

698
00:37:51.881 --> 00:37:55.798
(suspenseful music continues)

699
00:37:56.742 --> 00:37:59.409
(clock ticking)

700
00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.623
(clock ticking continues)

701
00:38:11.153 --> 00:38:13.903
(birds chirping)

702
00:38:15.969 --> 00:38:19.302
(exhales sharply) Okay.

703
00:38:23.871 --> 00:38:27.454
(Rebecca breathes heavily)

704
00:38:29.298 --> 00:38:30.131
Mm.

705
00:38:38.881 --> 00:38:41.631
(birds chirping)

706
00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:45.960
- [John] Mm.

707
00:38:46.925 --> 00:38:48.592
- Good morning.
- Mm.

708
00:38:54.041 --> 00:38:55.874
- Wake up. Johnny Boy.

709
00:38:57.078 --> 00:38:57.911
Wake up.

710
00:39:00.958 --> 00:39:02.610
- Mm.
- Want me to make

711
00:39:02.610 --> 00:39:03.843
you some coffee?

712
00:39:08.350 --> 00:39:09.483
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

713
00:39:10.823 --> 00:39:12.693
- Yeah. that'd be great.
- Okay.

714
00:39:13.717 --> 00:39:18.717
- Mm.

715
00:39:20.336 --> 00:39:22.753
(John yawns)

716
00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:26.493
Oh. or you can come back in bed.

717
00:39:33.302 --> 00:39:36.052
(birds chirping)

718
00:39:42.246 --> 00:39:44.996
(coffee rustles)

719
00:39:48.051 --> 00:39:51.875
(gentle suspenseful music)

720
00:39:51.875 --> 00:39:54.088
(John yawns)

721
00:39:54.088 --> 00:39:56.157
(John exhales sharply)

722
00:39:56.157 --> 00:39:57.625
(birds chirping)

723
00:39:57.625 --> 00:39:59.090
(John sniffs)

724
00:39:59.090 --> 00:40:01.383
(sighs) Smells great.

725
00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.380
I'll join you in a minute.

726
00:40:07.883 --> 00:40:09.840
(coffee burbling)

727
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.590
(glass clinking)

728
00:40:20.609 --> 00:40:25.609
(door clicks)
(door squeaks)

729
00:40:29.790 --> 00:40:32.823
- John. did you leave this
door unlocked last night?

730
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.503
- Ah. shit. um. yeah. I might've.

731
00:40:38.345 --> 00:40:40.440
- (sighs) Are you fucking kidding me?

732
00:40:40.440 --> 00:40:42.330
After that creepy guy
scared the shit out of us.

733
00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:44.250
you're gonna leave this door unlocked?

734
00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:46.163
- Like. I just came out to have a smoke.

735
00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.703
Okay. we're fine. it's
not that big a deal.

736
00:40:48.703 --> 00:40:49.536
- I get it.

737
00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:55.910
(door clicks)
(door squeaks)

738
00:40:56.734 --> 00:40:58.234
Ugh. unbelievable.

739
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:01.473
- Why. thank you.

740
00:41:02.370 --> 00:41:03.813
- Oh. wasn't a compliment.

741
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:11.099
(John sighs)

742
00:41:11.099 --> 00:41:13.932
(coffee sloshing)

743
00:41:19.370 --> 00:41:20.203
- Um.

744
00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:23.400
Thank you.
- Yep.

745
00:41:27.364 --> 00:41:32.364
(mug clanks)
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

746
00:41:40.087 --> 00:41:41.937
- How about I make us some breakfast?

747
00:41:42.795 --> 00:41:43.628
You hungry?

748
00:41:43.628 --> 00:41:44.523
- Yes. please.

749
00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.990
- [John] Do you want one egg or two?

750
00:41:48.990 --> 00:41:49.823
- Uh. two.

751
00:41:55.342 --> 00:41:58.342
(fridge door thuds)

752
00:42:00.485 --> 00:42:02.625
Aw. (chuckles)

753
00:42:02.625 --> 00:42:03.708
Wow. so cute.

754
00:42:04.784 --> 00:42:05.617
- What?

755
00:42:07.417 --> 00:42:08.973
- Come look at this.

756
00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:17.297
(Rebecca chuckles)

757
00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:21.118
They're available for fostering.

758
00:42:21.118 --> 00:42:22.923
(John exhales sharply)
Just saying.

759
00:42:24.318 --> 00:42:26.100
- Well. I'm just saying
that'll be really nice

760
00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:30.090
for whoever fosters them. anybody but us.

761
00:42:30.090 --> 00:42:31.940
But. hey. since we're on the subject.

762
00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:38.013
I could do a baby instead.

763
00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.150
- We haven't even started
planning our wedding yet.

764
00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:45.393
- Right. have you set a date for that?

765
00:42:47.469 --> 00:42:50.430
- (scoffs) Okay. we're not
about to have this conversation

766
00:42:50.430 --> 00:42:53.373
right now on our vacation. so.

767
00:42:56.373 --> 00:42:57.363
- (sighs) Right.

768
00:43:01.350 --> 00:43:03.873
I'll just go back to making breakfast.

769
00:43:07.438 --> 00:43:10.771
(bacon packet rustling)

770
00:43:12.995 --> 00:43:15.745
(bacon sizzling)

771
00:43:20.457 --> 00:43:23.040
- Mm. delicious. baby. thank you.

772
00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:23.890
- You're welcome.

773
00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:27.780
Hey. so I know you said
you didn't want to earlier.

774
00:43:27.780 --> 00:43:30.960
but it's nice outside.
- Mm.

775
00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.280
- I would love to go for a hike

776
00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.980
or a walk around the neighborhood.

777
00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.113
- And?

778
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.293
- And you're invited
if you'd like to join.

779
00:43:42.090 --> 00:43:43.083
- Um.

780
00:43:44.470 --> 00:43:46.320
I don't know. I. uh-

781
00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:48.237
- Don't worry about it.

782
00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:50.760
I'm probably just gonna
go after breakfast.

783
00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:52.800
- No. yeah. I just. I
love that for you. baby.

784
00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:55.293
I just don't really feel like it. so.

785
00:43:56.340 --> 00:43:57.870
- No pressure.

786
00:43:57.870 --> 00:44:00.990
- But I think I'm gonna
go and take my mat out.

787
00:44:00.990 --> 00:44:02.240
do some yoga on the deck.

788
00:44:04.034 --> 00:44:05.684
- (exhales sharply) That's great.

789
00:44:07.290 --> 00:44:08.868
I won't try to convince you.

790
00:44:08.868 --> 00:44:10.701
- [Rebecca] Thank you.

791
00:44:13.650 --> 00:44:15.690
- Couldn't even make it through breakfast.

792
00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.190
- No. I just have to send
a quick email. I forgot.

793
00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.213
- I'm just messing with you.

794
00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.120
- What? Are you mad?

795
00:44:27.120 --> 00:44:28.443
- No. no.

796
00:44:30.150 --> 00:44:31.600
I better go get ready though.

797
00:44:32.985 --> 00:44:33.818
- Okay.

798
00:44:36.799 --> 00:44:39.799
(dishes clattering)

799
00:44:45.381 --> 00:44:50.381
(birds chirping)
(footsteps plodding)

800
00:44:58.134 --> 00:45:00.884
(birds chirping)

801
00:45:01.733 --> 00:45:03.030
Okay.

802
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.863
All done.

803
00:45:04.860 --> 00:45:07.142
Should be good for the rest of the day.

804
00:45:07.142 --> 00:45:08.392
- That's great.

805
00:45:15.119 --> 00:45:17.730
(Rebecca sighs)

806
00:45:17.730 --> 00:45:19.380
- You gonna be like this all day?

807
00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:23.660
- I'm not being like anything.

808
00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.560
I just wanna get outside. go for a hike.

809
00:45:25.560 --> 00:45:26.710
get out in some nature.

810
00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:30.540
- Why did you move my toothbrush?

811
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:31.373
- I didn't.

812
00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:34.770
- John. it's okay. if you
knocked it over or something.

813
00:45:34.770 --> 00:45:35.603
just tell me.

814
00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:38.940
- Rebecca. I didn't touch your toothbrush.

815
00:45:38.940 --> 00:45:41.700
I only do when it's to
put it on the charger.

816
00:45:41.700 --> 00:45:44.970
- John. I know what I did
with my toothbrush last night.

817
00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:46.920
I finished brushing my teeth
and I put it right there

818
00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.083
next to the soap.

819
00:45:48.083 --> 00:45:50.160
(water sloshing)

820
00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:50.993
- Well.

821
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.470
um. yeah. I don't know what to tell you.

822
00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:57.933
- Well. I know I didn't move it so.

823
00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.003
had to have been you. but whatever.

824
00:46:08.576 --> 00:46:09.409
Bullshit.

825
00:46:13.157 --> 00:46:15.907
(birds chirping)

826
00:46:22.403 --> 00:46:25.986
(Rebecca breathes heavily)

827
00:46:32.918 --> 00:46:36.041
(suspenseful music)

828
00:46:36.041 --> 00:46:36.874
What?

829
00:46:43.264 --> 00:46:44.431
What the fuck?

830
00:46:48.006 --> 00:46:48.839
John?

831
00:46:55.716 --> 00:46:59.633
(suspenseful music continues)

832
00:47:06.977 --> 00:47:11.977
(suspenseful music continues)
(insects chirping)

833
00:47:19.823 --> 00:47:23.740
(suspenseful music continues)

834
00:47:30.852 --> 00:47:34.769
(suspenseful music continues)

835
00:47:41.886 --> 00:47:45.803
(suspenseful music continues)

836
00:47:48.227 --> 00:47:52.060
(dramatic suspenseful music)

837
00:47:59.371 --> 00:48:00.407
(knocking on door)
(Rebecca gasps)

838
00:48:00.407 --> 00:48:01.598
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

839
00:48:01.598 --> 00:48:02.431
Dammit!

840
00:48:05.751 --> 00:48:08.312
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

841
00:48:08.312 --> 00:48:09.330
Who is it?

842
00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:10.683
Oh. just a neighbor.

843
00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.533
I said. who is it?

844
00:48:17.940 --> 00:48:20.520
- Oh. I just live down the street.

845
00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.260
- How did you get into the gate?

846
00:48:22.260 --> 00:48:23.790
- Oh. I'm an old friend of the owner.

847
00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:26.340
He gave me an extra remote
in case for emergencies.

848
00:48:28.536 --> 00:48:31.051
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

849
00:48:31.051 --> 00:48:31.923
- (sighs) Jesus.

850
00:48:34.227 --> 00:48:35.640
- Hi.
- Hi. how can I help you?

851
00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:37.350
- I sincerely apologize
for disturbing you.

852
00:48:37.350 --> 00:48:40.438
but my little Piglet got out last night.

853
00:48:40.438 --> 00:48:42.660
(gentle suspenseful music)
(birds chirping)

854
00:48:42.660 --> 00:48:44.760
- Your cat's name is Piglet?

855
00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:45.593
- Yes. ma'am.

856
00:48:46.710 --> 00:48:48.360
- Okay. well. I haven't seen him.

857
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:53.253
- That's strange. I. I swear
I saw him come this way.

858
00:48:54.584 --> 00:48:57.060
And this is the only house that...

859
00:48:57.060 --> 00:49:00.330
You know. it's okay. ma'am. if
you could just do me a favor?

860
00:49:00.330 --> 00:49:01.770
If you happen to see him running around.

861
00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:02.940
do you mind just calling that number

862
00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.680
on the back of the picture?

863
00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.330
Uh. we just live a ways down the road

864
00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:08.530
and. well. there aren't
that many neighbors.

865
00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:11.520
Are you sure he is not in here?

866
00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:12.353
I know what I saw.

867
00:49:12.353 --> 00:49:13.920
And if you could just let me come in

868
00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.240
and take a quick look.
- No. it's okay.

869
00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:17.670
I have your number. right.
so I'll just give you a call.

870
00:49:17.670 --> 00:49:19.380
I'd rather you not come in the house. so.

871
00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:20.880
- Are you hiding my Piglet?

872
00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.137
- What?
- Are you hiding my baby?

873
00:49:22.137 --> 00:49:23.400
- No!
- I know he's in here.

874
00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:24.780
Okay. I know what I saw.

875
00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:25.740
Please just let me come in.

876
00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.839
just for a second. please.
- Okay. you're crazy.

877
00:49:27.839 --> 00:49:30.317
(knocking on door)

878
00:49:30.317 --> 00:49:32.071
- Let me in!
- What the?

879
00:49:32.071 --> 00:49:33.563
- Let me in.
(suspenseful music)

880
00:49:33.563 --> 00:49:34.396
- Geez.

881
00:49:41.836 --> 00:49:45.753
(suspenseful music continues)

882
00:49:53.356 --> 00:49:56.856
(Rebecca exhales sharply)

883
00:50:06.218 --> 00:50:08.416
(Rebecca grunts)

884
00:50:08.416 --> 00:50:11.123

Did you get a little sleepy out here?

907
00:52:30.210 --> 00:52:31.337
- Mm-hmm. yeah.

908
00:52:31.337 --> 00:52:33.047
And I feel like I was dreaming about you

Shower sounds nice.

918
00:52:48.720 --> 00:52:50.190

919
00:52:50.190 --> 00:52:53.040
- Aw. gross. (laughs)

920
00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.360

922

the couch and drinking all day?

965
00:56:38.748 --> 00:56:41.340
- (laughs) Yes. beyond that.

966

we can go into town.

968

We can go to the lake.
- Mm-hmm.

969
00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.723
- Both sound fun.

970
00:56:52.860 --> 00:56:53.793
Um.

971
00:56:54.870 --> 00:56:56.490
honestly. nothing sounds better

972
00:56:56.490 --> 00:56:59.412
than just lounging in
our underwear all day.

973
00:56:59.412 --> 00:57:00.810
(both laugh)

974
00:57:00.810 --> 00:57:02.190

979
00:57:14.040 --> 00:57:18.643
you know I can't go anywhere
without them. (laughs)

980
00:57:20.133 --> 00:57:22.907
I've been wearing these
UGGs since you met me. boy.

981

993
00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:20.460
But I'm rooting for it.
- Hey. these olives

994
00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:22.020

995
00:58:22.020 --> 00:58:23.820

- Ah.

996
00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:26.340

997
00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:27.440
- [John] Cheers. baby.

998
00:58:31.256 --> 00:58:32.333

999
00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:36.480
- Wow.

1000
00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.990
I mean. that's a fucking
pretty good martini.

1001
00:58:39.990 --> 00:58:41.160
- Yes. it is.
- I don't know

1002
00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:43.680
if it's worth $20.
(John laughs)

1003
00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.250
but it's pretty fucking good.
- Okay.

1004
00:58:46.250 --> 00:58:47.754
(Rebecca laughs)
I'll take that.

1005
00:58:47.754 --> 00:58:48.587
- Mm.

1006
00:58:49.423 --> 00:58:53.880
Everything just tastes
better up here. huh?

1007
00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:54.713
- Yeah.
- Hm.

1008
00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:56.873
- Hey.

1009
00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.880
I mean. we could just move here.

1010
00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:03.510
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah.

1011
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:05.610
- What. in like 10 years?

1012
00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:07.803
- Settle down. start a family.

1013
00:59:09.390 --> 00:59:11.160
- Yeah. that's an idea. (laughs)

1014
00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:11.993
- No.

1015
00:59:13.156 --> 00:59:14.073
I'm being serious.

1016
00:59:17.310 --> 00:59:18.143
- Baby.

1017
00:59:19.830 --> 00:59:21.120
you know

1018
00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.770
I can't leave LA 'cause of work.

1019
00:59:22.770 --> 00:59:25.443
I mean. plus our whole lives are there.

1020
00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:28.530
What would we do. just abandon everything?

1021
00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:32.010
- I'm just saying.

1022
00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:36.543
think about it?
(suspenseful music)

1023
00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:39.790
- Let's play a game.

1024
00:59:41.537 --> 00:59:44.790
(Rebecca chuckles)

1025
00:59:44.790 --> 00:59:45.803
- A game?

00:59:46.646 --> 00:59:47.776
(suspenseful music)

1027
00:59:47.776 --> 00:59:49.803
Um.
- What game do you wanna play?

1028
00:59:49.803 --> 00:59:51.629
- [Rebecca] Let's play poker.

1029
00:59:51.629 --> 00:59:54.057
- You wanna play poker?
- I'm good at poker.

1030
00:59:54.057 --> 00:59:56.610
- [John] Okay. do you have
the cards? Poker chips?

1031
00:59:56.610 --> 00:59:57.810
I mean. like. it's not
gonna be that much fun

1032
00:59:57.810 --> 00:59:59.812
without any poker chips.

1033
00:59:59.812 --> 01:00:00.645
(suspenseful music)
- No. I wouldn't

1034
01:00:00.645 --> 01:00:01.478
say that. John.

1035
01:00:01.478 --> 01:00:03.223
(Rebecca screams)
- Hey. hey!

1036
01:00:03.223 --> 01:00:04.056
(gun clicks)
Whoa. hey. man.

1037
01:00:04.056 --> 01:00:05.070
who the fuck are you?
- Hey. hey. hey. hey. hey.

1038
01:00:05.070 --> 01:00:06.693
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

1039
01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:10.380
- [John] What is this. man.
huh. what the fuck do you want?

1040
01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:12.070
- Is this how you treat a guest?

1041
01:00:12.969 --> 01:00:13.802
- Hey.

1042
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:16.503
- May I sit?
- Hey. man.

1043
01:00:17.550 --> 01:00:19.080
hey. whatever this is. man.

1044
01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.400
it ain't fucking funny. all right?

1045
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.933
- It isn't funny at all. what would be?

1046
01:00:25.590 --> 01:00:26.423
- John.

1047
01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:28.830
John.

1048
01:00:28.830 --> 01:00:30.270
- Hey. man.

1049
01:00:30.270 --> 01:00:32.229
Hey. look. we'll give you
whatever you want. man.

1050
01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:35.463
all right. please just. just
stop pointing the gun at her.

1051
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:39.090
- Do you see that. Rebecca?

1052
01:00:39.090 --> 01:00:42.780
This is John way try to take
some sort of control back

1053
01:00:42.780 --> 01:00:44.133
in this situation.

1054
01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.943
You have lost control. John.

1055
01:00:49.861 --> 01:00:51.483
- Okay. all right. hey.

1056
01:00:51.483 --> 01:00:52.683
hey. what can I do. huh?

1057
01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:54.720
Huh. what can I do?

1058
01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:56.010
- I'll tell you what you can do.

1059
01:00:56.010 --> 01:00:58.320
How about you fill that shaker with ice

1060
01:00:58.320 --> 01:00:59.490
and grab everything you need

1061
01:00:59.490 --> 01:01:02.553
in order to make one of those
perfect martinis of yours?

1062
01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.540
- Now?
- Yes. John. now.

1063
01:01:06.540 --> 01:01:10.080
If it takes more than a
minute. I shoot your wife.

1064
01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.450
Chop. chop.
(suspenseful music)

1065
01:01:12.450 --> 01:01:13.680
Don't do anything stupid.

1066
01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.593
I can see her forehead
from here perfectly.

1067
01:01:17.443 --> 01:01:18.453
- [John] Okay.

1068
01:01:18.453 --> 01:01:20.381
- It's okay. sweetheart.

1069
01:01:20.381 --> 01:01:22.500
(ice rattling)

1070
01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.523
Hurry up. John.

1071
01:01:24.895 --> 01:01:26.253
the clock is ticking.

1072
01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:31.293
Here we go. John.

1073
01:01:34.080 --> 01:01:35.070
Thank you kindly.

1074
01:01:35.070 --> 01:01:35.903
Have a seat.

1075
01:01:45.172 --> 01:01:48.960
Whoa. this is a perfect martini. John.

1076
01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.333
It's like a confection for bartender.

1077
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:55.653
Why you don't drink?

1078
01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:59.853
Sweethearts. come on. have a sip.

1079
01:02:02.340 --> 01:02:06.213
- You're a sick man.
(suspenseful music)

1080
01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:15.425
- Do I look like sick for you?

1081
01:02:15.425 --> 01:02:17.363
Do I look like sick for you?

1082
01:02:17.363 --> 01:02:20.057
I mean. John. do I look like sick for you?

1083
01:02:20.057 --> 01:02:22.896
'Cause I feel so healthy right now.

1084
01:02:22.896 --> 01:02:24.630
(Rebecca gasps)
- Fuck!

1085
01:02:24.630 --> 01:02:29.463
- Damn. eh. fuck. I just wanna
play our little game. man.

1086
01:02:33.090 --> 01:02:35.403
I need you to put these on. guys.

1087
01:02:35.403 --> 01:02:37.140
(handcuffs clank)

1088
01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.720
Come on. John. have a seat over there.

1089
01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:41.530
I said now. John.
- All right.

1090
01:02:41.530 --> 01:02:43.440
- have a seat over there.
- All right. all right.

1091
01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:46.116
okay. okay. all right.

1092
01:02:46.116 --> 01:02:48.750
(Rebecca breathing heavily)
- Chop chop. sweetheart.

1093
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:49.650
Have a seat there.

1094
01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:54.137
I want your left hand. her right hand.

1095
01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.340
- Hey. you never told us your name.

1096
01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:01.380
- My name is what? My name is who?

1097
01:03:01.380 --> 01:03:03.645
- What's your name? Hey!
(Rebecca crying)

1098
01:03:03.645 --> 01:03:04.478
Hey. are you okay?

1099
01:03:04.478 --> 01:03:08.400
Hey. okay. okay. all right. all right.

1100
01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:11.080
- Put them on.
(handcuffs rattling)

1101
01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:13.170
Could you squeeze them a little bit more?

1102
01:03:13.170 --> 01:03:16.339
You know. there is something
so satisfy about that sound.

1103
01:03:16.339 --> 01:03:20.250
(handcuffs creaking)
(Rebecca breathing shakily)

1104
01:03:20.250 --> 01:03:22.720
Like this.
(suspenseful music)

1105
01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:24.120
(chair rattles)

1106
01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.413
There you go. John.

1107
01:03:26.610 --> 01:03:27.443
- What now?

1108
01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:30.020
- That's the question. John.

1109
01:03:32.568 --> 01:03:34.260
We could watch a movie. how about that?

1110
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.007
I'm not sure. did you guys ever finish

1111
01:03:36.007 --> 01:03:37.980
"The Night of the Living Dead?"

1112
01:03:37.980 --> 01:03:42.510
Or. or maybe you can lead
us through some yoga.

1113
01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:43.810
That would be nice. Becky.

1114
01:03:49.931 --> 01:03:51.563
- [John] It's okay.

1115
01:03:51.563 --> 01:03:54.180
- No. John. it isn't okay at all.

1116
01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.377
But it will be. I promise you.

1117
01:03:59.766 --> 01:04:03.150
- (breathing heavily) Why.
why are you doing this. huh?

1118
01:04:06.688 --> 01:04:11.610
- (exhales sharply) I've
been playing this game

1119
01:04:11.610 --> 01:04:12.850
since I was

1120
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:15.873
16 years old.

1121
01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.383
My father passed it on to me.

1122
01:04:21.522 --> 01:04:23.730
and I must play one per year.

1123
01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:27.123
every year until I lose or I die.

1124
01:04:28.543 --> 01:04:30.207
It is what it is.

1125
01:04:30.207 --> 01:04:31.683
This is the way it has to be.

1126
01:04:33.690 --> 01:04:34.743
- But why us?

1127
01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.740
Why do you have to do this to us?

1128
01:04:37.740 --> 01:04:39.063
We don't deserve this.

1129
01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:44.160
- Why not you?

1130
01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.823
Why not you?

1131
01:04:45.823 --> 01:04:50.070
I mean. what makes you more
special than any other couples

1132
01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:52.623
in any other cabin in this little town?

1133
01:04:55.050 --> 01:04:55.893
Why you?

1134
01:04:59.010 --> 01:05:02.373
Well. I'm afraid just the luck of my draw.

1135
01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.033
I'm curious though.

1136
01:05:05.033 --> 01:05:08.283
would you ever replace yourself
with an innocent couple?

1137
01:05:09.484 --> 01:05:11.850
(suspenseful music)

1138
01:05:11.850 --> 01:05:12.683
Interesting.

1139
01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:20.060
I'm always so intrigued at this
moment between any couples.

1140
01:05:22.687 --> 01:05:23.520
- Okay.

1141
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:25.920
Okay. what happens now. huh?

1142
01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.613
- Straight to the point. I
like that about you. John.

1143
01:05:29.613 --> 01:05:32.088
But. you know. maybe
sometimes Becky will love

1144
01:05:32.088 --> 01:05:33.193
a little bit more of foreplay.

1145
01:05:33.193 --> 01:05:35.101
- You son of a bitch.

1146
01:05:35.101 --> 01:05:38.190
- (laughs) All right.
John. all right. John.

1147
01:05:38.190 --> 01:05:41.721
I think it's time to play our game. right?

1148
01:05:41.721 --> 01:05:44.804
(suspenseful music)

1149
01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.140
Now.

1150
01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:52.933
I assume you both are
familiar with the game of War.

1151
01:05:55.530 --> 01:06:00.530
Good.
(suspenseful music)

1152
01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:02.433
This is my beauty.

1153
01:06:03.420 --> 01:06:06.753
my extremely reliable beauty.

1154
01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.030
I'm gonna place a bullet

1155
01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:16.773
in one of the chamber.

1156
01:06:20.003 --> 01:06:23.086
(suspenseful music)

1157
01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:26.943
We play by the rules of War.

1158
01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:31.200
then the loser.

1159
01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:33.963
they're gonna play their own
game of Russian roulette.

1160
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:38.660
We play until there only two of us left.

1161
01:06:43.045 --> 01:06:44.640
and I'm gonna be

1162
01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:48.063
in every bit as much as you are.

1163
01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.043
Exciting. right?

1164
01:06:53.758 --> 01:06:55.520
- Who goes first?

1165
01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:58.920
- Meeny. miny.

1166
01:06:58.920 --> 01:06:59.753
moe.

1167
01:07:02.130 --> 01:07:04.503
let's put our fate in Rebecca hands.

1168
01:07:05.915 --> 01:07:07.515
Would you like to draw it first?

1169
01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:09.953
- No.

1170
01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:12.200
- What you mean no?

1171
01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:18.990
- I'm not gonna take part
in your sick little game.

1172
01:07:19.950 --> 01:07:21.177
if you wanna see someone dead.

1173
01:07:21.177 --> 01:07:24.213
you can pick up that gun
and take your own life.

1174
01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:26.313
This isn't on us.

1175
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:32.512
This is you being a psycho.
okay. we didn't do anything.

1176
01:07:32.512 --> 01:07:35.595
(suspenseful music)

1177
01:07:42.030 --> 01:07:42.863
- Becky.

1178
01:07:44.370 --> 01:07:46.413
the rules are simple.

1179
01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:51.213
If you refuse to play.
that's called forfeit.

1180
01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:53.693
So

1181
01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:58.563
any card that we draw
will be higher than yours.

1182
01:08:00.540 --> 01:08:05.453
So if you keep this route.
this game will be fairly quick.

1183
01:08:07.779 --> 01:08:10.590
(John exhales sharply)

1184
01:08:10.590 --> 01:08:12.273
The choice is yours. baby.

1185
01:08:15.236 --> 01:08:16.852
- God. John.

1186
01:08:16.852 --> 01:08:19.685
- Goddammit.
- John. what do we do?

1187
01:08:22.555 --> 01:08:25.007
- Draw a card. Rebecca.

1188
01:08:25.007 --> 01:08:29.327
- Bravo. John. bravo.
(suspenseful music)

1189
01:08:32.516 --> 01:08:34.516
- [John] Draw the card.

1190
01:08:37.079 --> 01:08:40.746
(Rebecca breathing heavily)

1191
01:08:45.571 --> 01:08:47.940
- (exhales sharply) Oh. Jesus.
- I mean.

1192
01:08:47.940 --> 01:08:49.240
there is plenty below her.

1193
01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:52.360
Action on you. John. you now.

1194
01:08:53.939 --> 01:08:57.022
(suspenseful music)

1195
01:09:01.532 --> 01:09:06.282
- [Rebecca] (breathes heavily) Oh. God.

1196
01:09:07.253 --> 01:09:08.517
- Okay.

1197
01:09:08.517 --> 01:09:09.350
Oh. okay.

1198
01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:11.513
So.

1199
01:09:14.850 --> 01:09:16.080
lucky number seven.

1200
01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.190
- Yes!

1201
01:09:17.190 --> 01:09:19.683
I'm not so lucky today. huh. John?

1202
01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:23.010
- Go ahead.

1203
01:09:27.095 --> 01:09:30.994
- Ah! (screams)
(Rebecca shrieks)

1204
01:09:30.994 --> 01:09:33.810
(John breathing heavily)

1205
01:09:33.810 --> 01:09:35.493
Told you this was exciting.

1206
01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:37.973
Ooh!

1207
01:09:40.222 --> 01:09:41.482
- Fuck.

1208
01:09:41.482 --> 01:09:45.000
(John and Rebecca breathing heavily)

1209
01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.588
- How many times have you done this?

1210
01:09:47.588 --> 01:09:49.438
- Are you sure you want to know that?

1211
01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.290
17 people. they come and
go the touch of this gun

1212
01:09:55.290 --> 01:09:57.600
since it came into my life.

1213
01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.163
Yes. John. now you know.

1214
01:10:00.150 --> 01:10:00.983
- Jesus.

1215
01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:06.273
- Well. I'm not a believer.

1216
01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:10.440
but if the Bible is true.

1217
01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.153
I'm sure it's on your side.

1218
01:10:15.389 --> 01:10:18.806
(John breathing heavily)

1219
01:10:21.039 --> 01:10:26.039
(gun tapping)
(suspenseful music)

1220
01:10:28.885 --> 01:10:31.635
(Rebecca groans)

1221
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:35.823
You're not dead yet.
John. you're not dead yet.

1222
01:10:36.911 --> 01:10:40.828
(suspenseful music continues)

1223
01:10:45.090 --> 01:10:46.740
How they say. winner. winner.

1224
01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.091
chicken dinner. right?
- Oh. fuck.

1225
01:10:48.091 --> 01:10:50.683
Goddammit.
(Rebecca groans)

1226
01:10:50.683 --> 01:10:51.885
(Rebecca breathing heavily)

1227
01:10:51.885 --> 01:10:56.052
It's okay. it's okay.
baby. it's okay. it's okay.

1228
01:10:57.376 --> 01:10:58.836
- (gasps) Oh my gosh.

1229
01:10:58.836 --> 01:10:59.670
John. (crying)
- It's okay.

1230
01:10:59.670 --> 01:11:00.664
Hey. I'll take this one.

1231
01:11:00.664 --> 01:11:02.420
I'll take-
- Don't you fucking

1232
01:11:02.420 --> 01:11:05.396
touch the gun or I'm gonna shoot her.

1233
01:11:05.396 --> 01:11:06.229
If you don't play
- Okay.

1234
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:07.780
Okay. okay.
- by the rules. I both shoot.

1235
01:11:07.780 --> 01:11:10.047
- Okay. okay. I fucking get it.

1236
01:11:10.047 --> 01:11:12.314
I get it. okay?
- Don't do it again. John.

1237
01:11:12.314 --> 01:11:13.605
Don't do it again.

1238
01:11:13.605 --> 01:11:15.688
- I'll play by the rules.

1239
01:11:17.443 --> 01:11:18.276
Ah. fuck!

1240
01:11:19.706 --> 01:11:22.015
(Rebecca groans)

1241
01:11:22.015 --> 01:11:23.177
Listen. (breathing heavily)

1242
01:11:23.177 --> 01:11:26.508
it's okay. its okay.
(Rebecca crying)

1243
01:11:26.508 --> 01:11:29.913
- Now. you bring up an
interesting carrier.

1244
01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:35.433
Rebecca can take this gun.

1245
01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:38.730
she can put it to her head.

1246
01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:43.680
Or she can choose to turn the gun on you.

1247
01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:47.640
- No. no. I could never.
(John breathes heavily)

1248
01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:51.215
No.
- No. but you have to.

1249
01:11:51.215 --> 01:11:52.482
- What?
- Honey. you have to.

1250
01:11:52.482 --> 01:11:55.052
look. I couldn't live
with myself without you.

1251
01:11:55.052 --> 01:11:56.346
(Rebecca and John breathing heavily)

1252
01:11:56.346 --> 01:11:58.080
All right. all right. you
have to do this. all right?

1253
01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.880
You have to do this for us.

1254
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:01.410
Okay?

1255
01:12:01.410 --> 01:12:03.150
Okay?
- No. no. no. no. no.

1256
01:12:03.150 --> 01:12:07.770
Please. please. sir. please.
I'm sorry for everything.

1257
01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:11.247
but please just d-don't
make me do this. okay?

1258
01:12:11.247 --> 01:12:13.773
(crying) We'll do anything. please.

1259
01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.143
- I will kill you.

1260
01:12:17.197 --> 01:12:20.070
And don't do anything stupid.

1261
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:21.123
It's your choice.

1262
01:12:22.212 --> 01:12:23.970
(Rebecca breathes heavily)

1263
01:12:23.970 --> 01:12:25.803
- Hey. hey. baby.

1264
01:12:26.850 --> 01:12:29.340
just grab the gun. okay.

1265
01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:31.503
one step at a time. okay?

1266
01:12:33.087 --> 01:12:33.920
Okay?

1267
01:12:40.364 --> 01:12:42.421
Come on. you got it.

1268
01:12:42.421 --> 01:12:44.377
(dramatic suspenseful music)
Come on. there you go.

1269
01:12:44.377 --> 01:12:48.723
There you go. baby. there
you go. there you go.

1270
01:12:48.723 --> 01:12:52.045
(Rebecca crying)

1271
01:12:52.045 --> 01:12:54.990
- But. John. (breathing heavily)

1272
01:12:54.990 --> 01:12:58.600
What if the bullet is in
the chamber when I shoot?

1273
01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:02.250
(suspenseful music)

1274
01:13:02.250 --> 01:13:04.650
- Honey. I'm not kidding. it has to be me.

1275
01:13:04.650 --> 01:13:05.483
- No.
- All right. it has.

1276
01:13:05.483 --> 01:13:06.780
you have to pull the trigger on me.

1277
01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:07.613
honey.
- No.

1278
01:13:07.613 --> 01:13:09.510
- Look. I know this isn't fair
of me to ask for you. honey.

1279
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:12.130
but I need you to do this. okay?

1280
01:13:12.130 --> 01:13:12.963
- John.

1281
01:13:14.010 --> 01:13:15.630
I can't hurt you.

1282
01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:18.167
- Oh. no. you're not hurting me.

1283
01:13:18.167 --> 01:13:20.910
All right. you're giving me what I want.

1284
01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:23.416
you're giving me a chance to see you live.

1285
01:13:23.416 --> 01:13:25.191
(Rebecca breathes heavily)
All right. whatever happens.

1286
01:13:25.191 --> 01:13:27.434
it's okay. it's okay.

1287
01:13:27.434 --> 01:13:28.267
Okay?

1288
01:13:30.130 --> 01:13:32.342
Okay. we've had a beautiful life together.

1289
01:13:32.342 --> 01:13:34.208
Huh? Right?
- Mm.

1290
01:13:34.208 --> 01:13:36.254
(John breathes heavily)
- We have. we have.

1291
01:13:36.254 --> 01:13:38.254
- Yeah. Yeah.
- We have.

1292
01:13:40.328 --> 01:13:41.947
(suspenseful music)

1293
01:13:41.947 --> 01:13:44.414
- It's okay. it's okay.
(Rebecca breathes heavily)

1294
01:13:44.414 --> 01:13:47.732
All right. (breathes
heavily) you have do this.

1295
01:13:47.732 --> 01:13:49.163
You have to do this.

1296
01:13:49.163 --> 01:13:51.913
- (crying) John.

1297
01:13:54.162 --> 01:13:55.245
- Okay. okay.

1298
01:13:57.008 --> 01:13:59.403
Just grab the gun. baby.
- (breathes heavily) No.

1299
01:13:59.403 --> 01:14:00.832
- Grab the gun. baby.
- No.

1300
01:14:00.832 --> 01:14:03.848
- Grab the gun. baby.
- No.

1301
01:14:03.848 --> 01:14:04.754
- All right.

1302
01:14:04.754 --> 01:14:07.325
(both breathing heavily)

1303
01:14:07.325 --> 01:14:09.459
- This is how it ends.
(suspenseful music)

1304
01:14:09.459 --> 01:14:13.031
(both breathing heavily)

1305
01:14:13.031 --> 01:14:16.214
- It was gonna end one
way or another. right?

1306
01:14:16.214 --> 01:14:18.090
(Rebecca crying)

1307
01:14:18.090 --> 01:14:19.670
I love you. Rebecca.

1308
01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:21.918
I love you so much.

1309
01:14:21.918 --> 01:14:23.050

I love you.

1311
01:14:24.878 --> 01:14:26.856
I've always loved you.

1312
01:14:26.856 --> 01:14:30.486
- Pull the trigger.
(Rebecca crying)

1313
01:14:30.486 --> 01:14:31.345
Pull the trigger.

1314
01:14:31.345 --> 01:14:32.363
(Rebecca screams)
(gun fires)

1315
01:14:32.363 --> 01:14:36.107

(Rebecca sobbing)

1316
