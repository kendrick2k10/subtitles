Dearest beloved. there is a
lot of history in Central Park.

10
00:01:59.261 --> 00:02:01.230
and probably even more secrets.

11
00:02:02.797 --> 00:02:04.766
I know because I
have a few of them.

12
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.208
Yeah. I've been at
the retirement party.

13
00:02:12.241 --> 00:02:13.708
didn't you get my call?

14
00:02:13.742 --> 00:02:15.177
Ah. I'm sorry.
I was in surgery.

15
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:16.946
Well. I should go so
I can make my flight.

16
00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:19.748
You said you wanted to
try to make it here.

17
00:02:19.781 --> 00:02:21.317
Yeah. look.
yeah. I know I did-

18
00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.053
- Yeah. I know. a bar full
of old drinking buddies

19
00:02:24.086 --> 00:02:25.888
doesn't sound so
good to me either.

20
00:02:25.921 --> 00:02:27.856
I'm sorry. I was in surgery.

21
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.091
Is Tom coming?

22
00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:30.026
Oh.

23
00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.792
Tell him he must.

24
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:35.563
So you don't care
about your old mentor?

25
00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:38.733
Look. I'd love
to see ya. I would-

26
00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:41.870
- Your fate is not your
intentions. but your actions.

27
00:02:43.305 --> 00:02:44.839
Okay.

28
00:02:49.345 --> 00:02:50.612
Cranberry juice.
and could you put it

29
00:02:50.645 --> 00:02:51.881
in a wine glass. please?

30
00:02:56.651 --> 00:02:58.620
These days
I keep things light.

31
00:03:00.622 --> 00:03:01.623
I tell jokes.

32
00:03:04.326 --> 00:03:06.228
Why are there so
many blondes in hell?

33
00:03:08.863 --> 00:03:10.266
Because they're so friggin' hot.

34
00:03:23.245 --> 00:03:25.680
You are not allowed
in here anymore.

35
00:03:25.713 --> 00:03:27.749
What are you talking about?

36
00:03:27.782 --> 00:03:29.285
Out!

37
00:03:29.318 --> 00:03:31.153
Any red's fine. I'm a quantity
over quality kinda girl.

38
00:03:32.154 --> 00:03:33.855
You are going to get me fired.

39
00:03:34.957 --> 00:03:36.926
That is not in your future.

40
00:03:37.893 --> 00:03:39.195
John says you do a lot more

41
00:03:39.228 --> 00:03:40.862
than tell fortunes
across the street.

42
00:03:41.997 --> 00:03:43.299
- Thomas!
- George!

43
00:03:43.332 --> 00:03:45.267
How
wonderful to see you.

44
00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:47.336
Let me get you some
of what we're having.

45
00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:49.671
I wanted you to catch my
wife and some other folks.

46
00:03:49.704 --> 00:03:52.408
but they've left already. so
we're the last of the group.

47
00:03:52.441 --> 00:03:54.944
We are the veritable drunks.

48
00:03:54.977 --> 00:03:57.246
and I have every intention
of getting quite ripe.

49
00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:00.049
and your late arrival provides
me the perfect excuse.

50
00:04:00.082 --> 00:04:02.084
Well. here is to the

51
00:04:03.252 --> 00:04:04.752
perfect excuse.

52
00:04:10.292 --> 00:04:12.694
That's the spirit. my boy!

53
00:04:14.997 --> 00:04:16.731
Yeah.

54
00:04:16.764 --> 00:04:19.235
This guy is not only the
finest doctor. but the kindest.

55
00:04:19.268 --> 00:04:22.837
I can't tell you how many
patients have come up.

56
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:24.440
Anybody 10 years
younger than me has got.

57
00:04:24.473 --> 00:04:26.108
stay for another round.

58
00:04:26.142 --> 00:04:27.675
As Virgil wrote...

59
00:04:32.915 --> 00:04:34.049
Anna.

60
00:04:34.083 --> 00:04:35.050
Wow.

61
00:04:35.084 --> 00:04:37.419
You look stunning.

62
00:04:39.121 --> 00:04:41.090
I thought
you quit drinking.

63
00:04:41.123 --> 00:04:41.924
I did.

64
00:04:43.092 --> 00:04:43.926
Till tonight.

65
00:04:44.927 --> 00:04:48.030
What happened. peer
pressure from your friends?

66
00:04:48.063 --> 00:04:50.099
Ah. I guess.

67
00:04:52.101 --> 00:04:53.102
I almost had a year.

68
00:04:53.135 --> 00:04:54.702
That sounds about right.

69
00:04:54.736 --> 00:04:55.737
That was the last
time I heard from you.

70
00:04:56.871 --> 00:04:58.174
I was on probation
at the hospital.

71
00:04:58.207 --> 00:04:59.975
and oh. to hell
with all that stuff.

72
00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:02.111
Anyways. I head upstate
before rush hour these days.

73
00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:04.446
You already finish that?

74
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.948
Yes. do try to keep up.

75
00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.285
Would you like another?

76
00:05:13.022 --> 00:05:14.990
Put your phone down
and politely answer me.

77
00:05:18.994 --> 00:05:19.962
Yes.

78
00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:23.831
To you.

79
00:05:23.865 --> 00:05:24.967
The one you forgot about.

80
00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:27.970
Oh. I remember that.

81
00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:29.771
Thomas.

82
00:05:29.804 --> 00:05:30.838
Hmm?

83
00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:31.706
Go home.

84
00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:48.424
Hey.

85
00:05:50.192 --> 00:05:51.393
Can we start over again?

86
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:53.295
From the beginning?

87
00:05:54.796 --> 00:05:56.999
Only if you do
what you promised me.

88
00:06:01.103 --> 00:06:03.505
Let's get outta here.

89
00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:04.974
That's a yes?

90
00:06:10.212 --> 00:06:11.080
Good evening.

91
00:06:12.147 --> 00:06:12.948
Shh.

92
00:06:12.982 --> 00:06:14.316
What?

93
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.019
Relax. you know. there
are people live here.

94
00:06:19.121 --> 00:06:21.357
I got this as a present.

95
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.191
It's gonna torture me.

96
00:06:22.224 --> 00:06:23.225
Yes!

97
00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:25.094
Yes. I will be right back!

98
00:06:32.134 --> 00:06:33.035
Voila.

99
00:06:43.845 --> 00:06:46.415
Do you and Brenda
still have sex?

100
00:06:47.616 --> 00:06:48.517
Not like we did.

101
00:06:49.551 --> 00:06:51.120
I like hearing that.

102
00:06:51.153 --> 00:06:52.187
You calling us we again.

103
00:06:58.227 --> 00:06:59.261
That's pretty.

104
00:06:59.295 --> 00:07:00.462
It used to be my mother's.

105
00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:03.165
I wish she'd met you.

106
00:07:03.198 --> 00:07:05.234
My grandfather used to
live on Central Park West.

107
00:07:05.267 --> 00:07:06.602
and my mother and I

108
00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:09.305
lived with him in
his last sick years.

109
00:07:09.338 --> 00:07:11.206
I remember.

110
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.442
Sometimes my mother would
turn off all the lights

111
00:07:13.475 --> 00:07:15.611
and we'd sit high
above the park.

112
00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:18.247
and she'd read from
Sarah Mae's journal.

113
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:19.081
Who's that?

114
00:07:20.282 --> 00:07:21.083
An ancestor.

115
00:07:22.451 --> 00:07:23.352
Are you religious?

116
00:07:23.385 --> 00:07:24.320
I always wanted to know.

117
00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:27.122
No.

118
00:07:27.156 --> 00:07:29.291
Do you consider
yourself spiritual?

119
00:07:29.325 --> 00:07:31.093
I'm a doctor.

120
00:07:31.126 --> 00:07:32.361
That's your answer?

121
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:38.100
I believe you live
and then you die.

122
00:07:38.133 --> 00:07:40.903
and I'm gonna go
to sleep now. okay?

123
00:07:40.936 --> 00:07:42.471
No. Thomas. you
never talk to me.

124
00:07:46.975 --> 00:07:49.611
Well. my father was
a very religious man.

125
00:07:49.645 --> 00:07:51.880
but his religion didn't
allow for medicine.

126
00:07:51.914 --> 00:07:56.018
so I was forced to watch
my mother wither and die.

127
00:07:57.252 --> 00:08:00.222
when science could
have saved her. so.

128
00:08:00.255 --> 00:08:01.557
So you became a doctor.

129
00:08:01.590 --> 00:08:02.591
I don't know why we're
talking about this.

130
00:08:02.624 --> 00:08:03.892
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

131
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:11.533
Remember our weekend
in the Catskills?

132
00:08:17.005 --> 00:08:19.174
That's when you first promised
me that you'd leave her.

133
00:08:25.047 --> 00:08:27.683
This is a better time for us.

134
00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:29.618
I don't wanna get
ahead of myself but.

135
00:08:31.286 --> 00:08:32.388
I believe in eternity.

136
00:08:35.958 --> 00:08:37.359
Remember the first night we met?

137
00:08:40.262 --> 00:08:41.597
So where should we go?

138
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:43.298
You live in this building?

139
00:08:43.332 --> 00:08:44.666
I love Central Park West.

140
00:08:46.034 --> 00:08:48.270
This is how you can
remember my name.

141
00:08:48.303 --> 00:08:50.305
♪ Ah Na ♪

142
00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:52.474
I like your two sinks.

143
00:08:52.508 --> 00:08:56.545
Which one does your wife use?

144
00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:58.981
You aren't regretting
this already. are you?

145
00:09:11.393 --> 00:09:14.396
Oh no. no. no.
no. no. no. no. no.

146
00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:20.636
Fuck.

147
00:09:20.669 --> 00:09:22.471
Good morning. sweetie pie.

148
00:09:22.504 --> 00:09:24.740
I ran out and I got more
champagne and I made mimosas.

149
00:09:24.773 --> 00:09:26.375
I also got vodka.

150
00:09:28.644 --> 00:09:31.280
I was thinking. we should
go to the park today.

151
00:09:31.313 --> 00:09:33.749
I got a
conference on Monday.

152
00:09:33.782 --> 00:09:36.251
Ah. that's Monday.

153
00:09:36.285 --> 00:09:37.619
No. I need to prepare.

154
00:09:37.653 --> 00:09:38.754
We never do anything
in the daytime together.

155
00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:40.689
I need to prepare.

156
00:09:40.722 --> 00:09:42.324
You can later.

157
00:09:42.357 --> 00:09:44.359
I really wanna have
a picnic in the park.

158
00:09:46.061 --> 00:09:46.695
All right.

159
00:09:48.063 --> 00:09:49.264
Let me look at my
computer. okay?

160
00:09:49.298 --> 00:09:50.399
Okay.

161
00:09:50.432 --> 00:09:51.233
Don't you take off just yet.

162
00:09:53.135 --> 00:09:53.969
I have an idea.

163
00:09:56.772 --> 00:09:57.606
Come here!

164
00:10:09.785 --> 00:10:12.187
So. Anne. you wanna sit here?

165
00:10:12.221 --> 00:10:13.589
No.

166
00:10:13.622 --> 00:10:15.657
Can I give you my private tour?

167
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:17.426
Sure.

168
00:10:17.459 --> 00:10:19.261
My mother and I used to spend
days discovering the park.

169
00:10:19.294 --> 00:10:20.162
Follow me.

170
00:10:20.195 --> 00:10:21.029
Okay.

171
00:10:26.335 --> 00:10:27.769
There's
an old path here.

172
00:10:27.803 --> 00:10:29.538
Oh. no. no. no. no. no. no.

173
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:33.141
I can't trespass.

174
00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:34.610
This used to always be open.

175
00:10:34.643 --> 00:10:35.811
but now it's shut off
so not many people go.

176
00:10:35.844 --> 00:10:37.346
I don't know.

177
00:10:37.379 --> 00:10:38.380
Thomas. no one's
gonna care if you

178
00:10:38.413 --> 00:10:39.648
jump over this low fence.

179
00:10:39.681 --> 00:10:40.582
All right. all
right. all right. here.

180
00:10:44.353 --> 00:10:45.521
See. now
wasn't that fun?

181
00:10:45.554 --> 00:10:46.355
Come on.

182
00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:01.470
It's hard to believe
that this actually exists.

183
00:11:01.503 --> 00:11:03.605
These days if something
isn't on the official map.

184
00:11:03.639 --> 00:11:04.673
it doesn't exist.

185
00:11:04.706 --> 00:11:05.541
Yeah.

186
00:11:08.777 --> 00:11:10.512
Huh.

187
00:11:10.546 --> 00:11:14.082
My mother used to call
this the wise woman tree.

188
00:11:14.116 --> 00:11:15.484
Really?

189
00:11:15.517 --> 00:11:16.552
Sounds like she was
really imaginative.

190
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.721
This is something we
used to do together.

191
00:11:19.755 --> 00:11:21.423
You have to try this with me.

192
00:11:21.456 --> 00:11:22.491
You're insane.

193
00:11:22.524 --> 00:11:23.325
Come on!

194
00:11:23.358 --> 00:11:24.493
You're insane.

195
00:11:25.895 --> 00:11:28.497
I just remembered my
mother buried something here.

196
00:11:29.598 --> 00:11:30.532
That's bizarre.

197
00:11:30.566 --> 00:11:31.400
What was it?

198
00:11:33.135 --> 00:11:35.370
I can't remember
what or where.

199
00:11:35.404 --> 00:11:37.506
Hey look.
Anna. you know.

200
00:11:37.539 --> 00:11:40.208
that's great. but can
we eat. I'm hungry.

201
00:11:41.176 --> 00:11:43.412
That's your way of
ending a discussion. I see.

202
00:11:43.445 --> 00:11:45.414
All I said is that
I'm hungry. okay?

203
00:11:45.447 --> 00:11:46.515
Well let's eat here.

204
00:11:46.548 --> 00:11:48.216
That's fine. let's eat here.

205
00:11:52.154 --> 00:11:53.555
So what do you do these days?

206
00:11:53.589 --> 00:11:54.523
"What do you do?"

207
00:11:54.556 --> 00:11:55.857
Give me a break.

208
00:11:55.892 --> 00:11:57.859
You certainly didn't
care last night.

209
00:11:57.894 --> 00:12:01.396
Excuse me for wanting to get
to know you a little better.

210
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:03.332
Why don't you ask more
important questions?

211
00:12:03.365 --> 00:12:05.367
Like why were we
brought together again.

212
00:12:06.401 --> 00:12:08.403
alone. here?

213
00:12:08.437 --> 00:12:10.238
I don't know.

214
00:12:10.272 --> 00:12:11.673
I'll give you one guess.

215
00:12:11.707 --> 00:12:12.741
I give up.

216
00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:14.343
Play. come on. hide and seek!

217
00:12:14.376 --> 00:12:15.243
I feel like I'm
with my daughter now.

218
00:12:15.277 --> 00:12:16.612
How is Mandy?

219
00:12:16.645 --> 00:12:17.713
She just turned
15 a few weeks ago.

220
00:12:18.847 --> 00:12:19.648
Lovely.

221
00:12:19.681 --> 00:12:21.149
Now. come on.

222
00:12:21.183 --> 00:12:22.250
Anna!

223
00:12:22.284 --> 00:12:23.118
Anna!

224
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:26.154
Come on!

225
00:12:28.523 --> 00:12:29.391
Anna!

226
00:12:30.425 --> 00:12:31.259
Anna!

227
00:12:33.528 --> 00:12:34.529
This is crazy.

228
00:12:34.563 --> 00:12:35.397
I can't believe this shit.

229
00:12:36.598 --> 00:12:37.432
Anna!

230
00:12:40.569 --> 00:12:41.403
Come on!

231
00:12:47.643 --> 00:12:48.443
Anna!

232
00:12:53.682 --> 00:12:54.816
Anna. come on!

233
00:12:56.718 --> 00:12:58.220
Christ!

234
00:12:58.253 --> 00:12:59.755
Anna. I've been
shouting your name!

235
00:13:00.756 --> 00:13:01.690
Didn't you hear me?

236
00:13:02.892 --> 00:13:04.192
Oh. I guess I didn't.

237
00:13:04.226 --> 00:13:04.860
No?

238
00:13:06.561 --> 00:13:07.629
What is that?

239
00:13:07.663 --> 00:13:08.931
I feel comfortable with you.

240
00:13:08.965 --> 00:13:11.333
so I hope I can
tell you anything.

241
00:13:11.366 --> 00:13:12.434
Yeah?

242
00:13:12.467 --> 00:13:13.368
Like what?

243
00:13:13.402 --> 00:13:14.503
I feel something here.

244
00:13:17.873 --> 00:13:18.774
A presence.

245
00:13:18.807 --> 00:13:20.609
Oh man. cut the crap.

246
00:13:20.642 --> 00:13:23.578
You think I'm kidding.
but I'm receptive.

247
00:13:24.947 --> 00:13:26.448
Okay. good or bad?

248
00:13:28.684 --> 00:13:32.554
I don't know. or
I shouldn't say.

249
00:13:32.587 --> 00:13:34.656
Can you read my
mind right now?

250
00:13:34.690 --> 00:13:36.625
I have a pretty
good idea what you think.

251
00:13:36.658 --> 00:13:38.427
Yeah?

252
00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.861
Well I'm thinking that
you're acting fucking cuckoo.

253
00:13:39.896 --> 00:13:40.897
You're an asshole.

254
00:13:48.537 --> 00:13:49.838
Wait.

255
00:13:49.871 --> 00:13:51.908
Wait Thomas. I know.
sometimes I'm too much.

256
00:13:53.009 --> 00:13:54.576
I tried to have an open mind.

257
00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:57.679
The trespassing. the graveyard.

258
00:13:59.347 --> 00:14:00.849
I've had it. I just
can't do this anymore.

259
00:14:00.883 --> 00:14:02.451
Thomas-

260
00:14:02.484 --> 00:14:03.518
- I'm gonna go grab the
rest of our stuff. okay?

261
00:14:03.552 --> 00:14:03.785
No. no. let's make a fire.

262
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:06.022
What?

263
00:14:06.055 --> 00:14:07.255
Absolutely not.

264
00:14:07.289 --> 00:14:07.990
Why not?

265
00:14:08.024 --> 00:14:08.991
No one would notice.

266
00:14:09.025 --> 00:14:09.926
It's illegal.

267
00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:11.359
Thomas. sit down.

268
00:14:11.393 --> 00:14:13.729
Sit down. okay?

269
00:14:13.762 --> 00:14:15.664
Relax a little. okay?

270
00:14:15.697 --> 00:14:17.766
When do you ever get to
just let go a little?

271
00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:19.501
That's all we're doing. right?

272
00:14:21.904 --> 00:14:22.972
Hang on. hang on.

273
00:14:23.005 --> 00:14:23.872
I'm feeling a little-

274
00:14:23.906 --> 00:14:25.373
- Thomas. kiss me.

275
00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:26.808
I'm feeling a
little not right.

276
00:14:26.842 --> 00:14:28.543
I need to sit down and breathe.

277
00:14:28.577 --> 00:14:30.278
Are you all right?

278
00:14:30.312 --> 00:14:31.580
I'm feeling a little not good.

279
00:14:58.007 --> 00:14:59.608
It's happening again.

280
00:15:01.077 --> 00:15:02.444
I can hear it.

281
00:15:03.512 --> 00:15:05.547
I can hear it calling me.

282
00:16:00.136 --> 00:16:01.369
Hi.

283
00:16:01.403 --> 00:16:03.438
I'd given up hearing from you.

284
00:16:03.471 --> 00:16:06.408
Oh. how's Philly. how's
your sister and Brian?

285
00:16:06.441 --> 00:16:07.843
They're fine.

286
00:16:07.877 --> 00:16:09.845
No. it's actually been
a really good trip.

287
00:16:09.879 --> 00:16:12.081
Oh. Mandy wanted to know
if you'd Skype with her.

288
00:16:12.114 --> 00:16:13.015
Okay. I will.

289
00:16:13.049 --> 00:16:14.116
All right. I love you.

290
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:15.617
Love you. gotta go.

291
00:16:19.654 --> 00:16:20.589
Hey Dad.

292
00:16:20.622 --> 00:16:21.991
Hey honey.

293
00:16:22.024 --> 00:16:23.625
I'm kinda jealous
you're in the city.

294
00:16:23.658 --> 00:16:26.795
Look. I got that
bracelet you gave me.

295
00:16:26.828 --> 00:16:28.898
I'm working on my
science fair project.

296
00:16:28.931 --> 00:16:30.732
I ran out of time to do that.

297
00:16:30.765 --> 00:16:32.467
I see.

298
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:33.970
Please don't lecture
me about time management.

299
00:16:34.003 --> 00:16:36.471
because Mom already did that.

300
00:16:36.504 --> 00:16:37.639
I gotta meet Jen.

301
00:16:37.672 --> 00:16:38.773
Chat soon?

302
00:16:38.807 --> 00:16:39.641
Bye.

303
00:16:40.742 --> 00:16:41.576
Oh well.

304
00:17:02.932 --> 00:17:04.666
Here to see Dr.
Winters. right?

305
00:17:04.699 --> 00:17:05.935
Yep. he said
he'd leave me a key

306
00:17:05.968 --> 00:17:07.802
since I'm arriving so late.

307
00:17:07.836 --> 00:17:08.703
Night owl. eh?

308
00:17:08.737 --> 00:17:09.537
Yeah.

309
00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.040
Me too.

310
00:17:11.073 --> 00:17:12.774
He didn't mention anything
about a key. though.

311
00:17:12.807 --> 00:17:14.476
Ah. he said you have
one for the cleaning lady.

312
00:17:14.509 --> 00:17:15.777
Yes ma'am.

313
00:17:15.810 --> 00:17:17.612
Don't call me
ma'am. it's Anna.

314
00:17:17.646 --> 00:17:18.680
Here you go. Anna.

315
00:17:19.814 --> 00:17:21.050
Thank you.

316
00:17:47.809 --> 00:17:51.746
My mother used to say that
Central Park was a cemetery

317
00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:55.918
for broken hearts and broken
souls. called The Unrequited.

318
00:17:56.886 --> 00:17:58.820
and they don't rest in peace.

319
00:17:58.853 --> 00:18:00.189
She was one of them.

320
00:18:00.222 --> 00:18:01.790
Sarah Mae too.

321
00:18:01.823 --> 00:18:03.758
Her one wish for me was
that I never become one.

322
00:18:03.792 --> 00:18:08.563
Now that we're back together
again. her wish has come true.

323
00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:14.223
Some people have what
they don't deserve.

324
00:20:18.894 --> 00:20:19.895
What the hell are you doing?

325
00:20:19.929 --> 00:20:21.629
I'm calling the cops.

326
00:20:53.462 --> 00:20:54.263
Hey.

327
00:20:55.431 --> 00:20:56.966
How'd you get in here?

328
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.102
I'm here so you can apologize.

329
00:21:01.237 --> 00:21:02.871
Apologize?

330
00:21:02.905 --> 00:21:04.206
What on Earth would I
have to apologize for?

331
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.773
I'm the one who
woke up in the dark.

332
00:21:05.807 --> 00:21:07.276
and it was startling
to say the least.

333
00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:10.012
I don't know what you're
talking about. you left me.

334
00:21:10.045 --> 00:21:11.413
Oh. give me a break.

335
00:21:11.447 --> 00:21:13.015
Oh. no. no. no. you're
not sitting down.

336
00:21:13.048 --> 00:21:14.383
I want you to gather
up your stuff. okay?

337
00:21:14.416 --> 00:21:16.085
I don't have anything here.

338
00:21:16.118 --> 00:21:18.254
Well then gather up some
of Brenda's stuff you used.

339
00:21:18.287 --> 00:21:19.754
So you're already sick of me?

340
00:21:21.223 --> 00:21:22.424
Oh. oh. hey honey.

341
00:21:23.325 --> 00:21:24.859
How's Philly?

342
00:21:24.894 --> 00:21:26.128
I'm back.

343
00:21:26.162 --> 00:21:27.429
You know I have
patients on Sunday now.

344
00:21:27.463 --> 00:21:30.032
Sorry. I was
just concentrating.

345
00:21:31.267 --> 00:21:32.268
- Yeah!
- What's that noise?

346
00:21:32.301 --> 00:21:33.469
TV. the TV.

347
00:21:35.371 --> 00:21:38.240
So are you still thinking
about coming up here tonight?

348
00:21:38.274 --> 00:21:40.309
Oh. I wish. but I finally
got the dishwasher guy

349
00:21:40.342 --> 00:21:42.311
to come upstate early tomorrow.

350
00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:44.413
Maybe I can meet you after
your conference downtown.

351
00:21:44.446 --> 00:21:46.382
Well let's figure
that out later. okay?

352
00:21:46.415 --> 00:21:47.883
Oh.

353
00:21:47.917 --> 00:21:49.018
My next session's starting.

354
00:22:02.131 --> 00:22:03.865
Hey. you shouldn't get
into stuff like this.

355
00:22:03.899 --> 00:22:05.833
Mind your business. lady.

356
00:22:06.902 --> 00:22:07.970
Hey. oh my god!

357
00:22:39.301 --> 00:22:40.102
Hey.

358
00:22:42.837 --> 00:22:43.738
Are you all right?

359
00:22:46.808 --> 00:22:47.910
I like your elephant.

360
00:22:52.948 --> 00:22:54.083
You can talk to me if you want.

361
00:22:54.116 --> 00:22:57.019
My mom's just not good.

362
00:23:04.526 --> 00:23:05.394
You want a hug?

363
00:23:12.468 --> 00:23:13.535
I gotta go.

364
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:18.873
Bye.

365
00:23:37.293 --> 00:23:38.127
Yes Mom.

366
00:23:39.194 --> 00:23:40.062
Yes Mom.

367
00:24:18.133 --> 00:24:20.135
Dearest beloved.

368
00:24:20.169 --> 00:24:21.937
it's happening again.

369
00:24:23.272 --> 00:24:25.074
The ground is calling me.

370
00:25:23.198 --> 00:25:24.500
Anna.

371
00:25:24.533 --> 00:25:26.168
Hey. I have to
ask you something.

372
00:25:26.201 --> 00:25:28.404
I've not
seen you in centuries.

373
00:25:28.437 --> 00:25:31.240
You let the last man go
and the one before that.

374
00:25:31.273 --> 00:25:33.075
You don't follow
through with the ritual.

375
00:25:33.108 --> 00:25:34.443
Why does it have to be Thomas?

376
00:25:34.476 --> 00:25:36.712
Can't I just have a
baby with any guy?

377
00:25:36.745 --> 00:25:38.447
You
remember nothing!

378
00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:41.250
You began the ritual
with Thomas a year ago.

379
00:25:42.351 --> 00:25:44.219
when the Unrequited
Constellation

380
00:25:44.253 --> 00:25:46.355
was aligned with the Black Moon.

381
00:25:46.388 --> 00:25:49.491
So now your curse can only
be lifted by a new life.

382
00:25:49.525 --> 00:25:51.293
- A baby?
- Yes.

383
00:25:51.326 --> 00:25:53.195
Or you could
sacrifice a young virgin.

384
00:25:53.228 --> 00:25:54.663
which I'm sure
you're not up for.

385
00:25:55.531 --> 00:25:57.466
Okay. so I'll
complete it with Thomas.

386
00:25:57.499 --> 00:25:59.168
I'll do it this time.

387
00:25:59.201 --> 00:26:00.469
Nah. you will
be so soft and let him go.

388
00:26:00.502 --> 00:26:02.504
Thanks for your
words of encouragement.

389
00:26:07.476 --> 00:26:10.179
Hey. it's Anna.
your old patient.

390
00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.215
I was wondering if
I could come back.

391
00:26:15.417 --> 00:26:17.085
I feel like only
you can help me.

392
00:26:32.234 --> 00:26:35.237
One night. my mother was
really drunk and popping pills.

393
00:26:36.238 --> 00:26:39.675
She convinced herself that
some of Sarah Mae's suggestions

394
00:26:39.708 --> 00:26:43.512
would work on Phillip.
this guy she loved.

395
00:26:45.314 --> 00:26:49.485
After many drinks. they
headed into the park.

396
00:26:52.621 --> 00:26:54.456
I knew what she was doing.

397
00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:59.328
It was what Sarah Mae wrote
about. a spell. black magic.

398
00:26:59.361 --> 00:27:03.699
At first. the spell seemed to
work. because he'd loved her.

399
00:27:03.732 --> 00:27:06.401
I figured I'd head home.

400
00:27:06.435 --> 00:27:08.604
I was pushed from behind.

401
00:27:09.771 --> 00:27:11.740
It was Phillip.
he had the knife.

402
00:27:13.475 --> 00:27:17.513
He said if I did what
he said. I'd be okay.

403
00:27:18.747 --> 00:27:22.284
I saw the world of
dark. and I entered it.

404
00:27:23.585 --> 00:27:25.220
You see me as a bad person.

405
00:27:25.254 --> 00:27:26.255
You're projecting.

406
00:27:28.423 --> 00:27:29.291
How old were you?

407
00:27:32.294 --> 00:27:33.128
12.

408
00:27:36.098 --> 00:27:37.733
Well. I have
something you don't.

409
00:27:39.568 --> 00:27:42.671
Broken people have a
strength you'll never touch.

410
00:28:13.135 --> 00:28:15.103
No. the conference
is an all day event.

411
00:28:16.471 --> 00:28:17.472
Ah. fuck.

412
00:28:17.506 --> 00:28:19.541
No. no. no. no. I'm sorry.

413
00:28:19.575 --> 00:28:21.343
Tuesday. yeah. Tuesday. bye.

414
00:28:24.513 --> 00:28:26.181
Hey. did I miss a call from you?

415
00:28:26.214 --> 00:28:28.216
Yeah. your
girlfriend was here.

416
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:29.818
Excuse me. I'm married.

417
00:28:29.851 --> 00:28:31.486
Anyways. I
didn't know if you were home.

418
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.354
She left.

419
00:28:39.261 --> 00:28:40.562
Hey Vincent.

420
00:28:40.596 --> 00:28:41.863
As a doorman.
it's my job to keep

421
00:28:41.898 --> 00:28:42.798
everyone's business
to themselves.

422
00:28:42.831 --> 00:28:44.333
I appreciate that.

423
00:28:44.366 --> 00:28:45.567
Do you still have
season tickets?

424
00:28:46.535 --> 00:28:47.836
Yes I do.

425
00:28:47.869 --> 00:28:49.371
My nephew's
birthday's coming up.

426
00:28:50.772 --> 00:28:51.607
Oh.

427
00:28:54.343 --> 00:28:55.744
I see.

428
00:28:55.777 --> 00:28:56.612
Thanks.

429
00:28:58.413 --> 00:28:59.548
Hey.

430
00:28:59.581 --> 00:29:00.415
Hey.

431
00:29:00.449 --> 00:29:01.817
Yeah.

432
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:04.386
Hey. I don't like how
I just ran out earlier.

433
00:29:04.419 --> 00:29:06.455
so I just wanted to
say a proper goodbye.

434
00:29:06.488 --> 00:29:08.590
because that seems
to be what you want.

435
00:29:08.624 --> 00:29:10.459
Okay. thanks. I appreciate it.

436
00:29:10.492 --> 00:29:11.793
Wait. wait!

437
00:29:11.827 --> 00:29:13.195
What?

438
00:29:13.228 --> 00:29:14.796
So goodbye?

439
00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:15.631
Goodbye. Anna.

440
00:29:15.664 --> 00:29:17.499
No. no. no.

441
00:29:17.532 --> 00:29:18.634
We should at least have a
walk in the park or something.

442
00:29:18.667 --> 00:29:19.801
- A last one.
- No. no. I-

443
00:29:19.835 --> 00:29:20.669
Thomas!

444
00:29:21.870 --> 00:29:23.906
It's gotta be quick.
let's go. come on.

445
00:29:26.341 --> 00:29:27.709
It's so gorgeous out tonight.

446
00:29:31.948 --> 00:29:33.548
Oh Thomas. I love this spot.

447
00:29:33.582 --> 00:29:34.583
What?

448
00:29:34.616 --> 00:29:35.584
I love this.

449
00:29:43.692 --> 00:29:44.526
Yeah.

450
00:29:48.764 --> 00:29:51.566
- It looks great. yeah.
- Yeah.

451
00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.536
Yeah.

452
00:29:54.569 --> 00:29:55.938
Do you hear that?

453
00:29:55.972 --> 00:29:56.939
What?

454
00:29:56.973 --> 00:29:57.806
What?

455
00:30:00.977 --> 00:30:01.810
Anna.

456
00:30:02.912 --> 00:30:03.779
I didn't hear it.

457
00:30:04.881 --> 00:30:06.348
I don't see anything you see.

458
00:30:06.381 --> 00:30:08.850
and I don't hear
anything you hear.

459
00:30:08.885 --> 00:30:10.452
I never have. okay?

460
00:30:11.553 --> 00:30:14.656
So. goodbye.

461
00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:15.557
Goodbye. Anna.

462
00:30:17.759 --> 00:30:18.593
Thomas!

463
00:30:24.033 --> 00:30:27.669
I knew he was back to
prescribing pills for himself.

464
00:30:27.703 --> 00:30:29.604
mixed with intense drinking.

465
00:30:30.907 --> 00:30:32.774
The sweats. the behavior.

466
00:30:33.842 --> 00:30:35.477
After all. I knew him.

467
00:30:36.678 --> 00:30:37.746
I knew him very well.

468
00:30:40.983 --> 00:30:41.984
Thomas!

469
00:30:45.587 --> 00:30:46.555
You can't just leave me.

470
00:31:05.407 --> 00:31:06.641
Hey. hey.

471
00:31:06.675 --> 00:31:08.844
I'm her boyfriend. okay guys?

472
00:31:08.878 --> 00:31:09.778
Is she okay?

473
00:31:09.811 --> 00:31:10.679
Yeah. she's fine.

474
00:31:10.712 --> 00:31:11.981
I'm her boyfriend.

475
00:31:12.014 --> 00:31:12.949
She has these episodes.
I'm her boyfriend

476
00:31:12.982 --> 00:31:14.616
and her doctor. okay?

477
00:31:14.649 --> 00:31:15.952
You want us to call
the police or anything?

478
00:31:15.985 --> 00:31:17.452
Oh. that's not
necessary. it really isn't.

479
00:31:17.486 --> 00:31:18.520
it really isn't.

480
00:31:18.553 --> 00:31:19.855
It looks a lot worse than it is.

481
00:31:19.889 --> 00:31:20.890
Hey honey.

482
00:31:20.923 --> 00:31:21.690
I'm her doctor. you guys.

483
00:31:21.723 --> 00:31:23.358
Okay. thank you.

484
00:31:23.391 --> 00:31:25.794
One. two. and three.

485
00:31:26.795 --> 00:31:27.562
Okay. we did it.

486
00:31:27.596 --> 00:31:29.065
You okay?

487
00:31:29.098 --> 00:31:30.933
All right. let me
get your purse.

488
00:31:30.967 --> 00:31:33.368
No. no. no. I got you.
I got you. I got you.

489
00:31:33.401 --> 00:31:34.436
It's gonna be fine.

490
00:31:34.469 --> 00:31:35.370
Let's go now. let's go home.

491
00:31:35.403 --> 00:31:36.705
All right. ready?

492
00:31:36.738 --> 00:31:37.539
Thanks. you guys!

493
00:31:41.710 --> 00:31:43.712
I don't know what
happened out there.

494
00:31:43.745 --> 00:31:45.547
I'll tell you
after I rest more.

495
00:32:10.872 --> 00:32:13.708
You asked who my
ancestor Sarah Mae was.

496
00:32:13.742 --> 00:32:17.679
She'd been thrown out of Ireland
for doing spells and magic.

497
00:32:17.712 --> 00:32:19.748
and even though her
country was in the middle

498
00:32:19.781 --> 00:32:21.918
of the great potato famine.

499
00:32:21.951 --> 00:32:23.418
her town bought her a ticket

500
00:32:23.451 --> 00:32:25.320
to the new world
on a coffin ship.

501
00:32:26.688 --> 00:32:29.558
Called that because so
many people died aboard.

502
00:32:29.591 --> 00:32:33.062
Sarah Mae found her
way to Seneca Village.

503
00:32:33.095 --> 00:32:36.364
the village they destroyed
to build Central Park.

504
00:32:36.398 --> 00:32:38.767
There were schools. churches.

505
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:41.670
History doesn't mention the
darker side of the village.

506
00:32:41.703 --> 00:32:44.739
Here Sarah Mae met her people.

507
00:32:44.773 --> 00:32:46.808
West Africans who
taught her voodoo.

508
00:32:46.842 --> 00:32:49.045
which she really made her own.

509
00:32:49.078 --> 00:32:52.081
They worshiped. they prayed.

510
00:32:52.114 --> 00:32:53.883
I won't tell you
who they prayed to.

511
00:33:09.698 --> 00:33:11.766
Thomas. kiss me.

512
00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:12.701
No.

513
00:33:12.734 --> 00:33:14.136
Kiss me.

514
00:33:14.170 --> 00:33:15.604
No.

515
00:33:15.637 --> 00:33:16.973
Tear me apart.

516
00:33:17.006 --> 00:33:17.839
Stop it.

517
00:33:24.881 --> 00:33:26.648
You shouldn't drink like that.

518
00:33:26.681 --> 00:33:27.716
What the hell do you care?

519
00:33:27.749 --> 00:33:28.850
You don't give a shit about me.

520
00:33:30.518 --> 00:33:32.088
Okay. so rest up and you
can leave in the morning.

521
00:33:32.121 --> 00:33:33.521
Well. if you want me to
go then. I'll just go now.

522
00:33:33.555 --> 00:33:34.689
Okay. if that's what you want.

523
00:33:34.723 --> 00:33:36.491
Nice.

524
00:33:36.524 --> 00:33:37.425
You know what-

525
00:33:37.459 --> 00:33:38.526
- You arrogant fuck.

526
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.562
You know what. you win.

527
00:33:40.595 --> 00:33:41.898
That's it.

528
00:33:41.931 --> 00:33:43.933
Bitch. I'm done
with you. let's go.

529
00:33:43.966 --> 00:33:45.968
Uh-uh. I think
it's time we talk

530
00:33:46.002 --> 00:33:48.737
about the elephant in
the room. sit down.

531
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:49.604
Okay.

532
00:33:51.773 --> 00:33:53.109
What would that be?

533
00:33:53.142 --> 00:33:54.476
The fact that we
both know it's time

534
00:33:54.509 --> 00:33:56.112
for you to leave Brenda.

535
00:33:56.145 --> 00:33:57.880
Thomas. I love you.

536
00:33:59.081 --> 00:34:00.782
Tell me you love me.
it'll probably feel good

537
00:34:00.815 --> 00:34:02.118
to get it out in the open.

538
00:34:04.053 --> 00:34:05.787
Come here.

539
00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:06.688
Come here.

540
00:34:13.896 --> 00:34:15.697
I will never love you.

541
00:34:16.665 --> 00:34:18.500
You told me.

542
00:34:18.533 --> 00:34:20.136
What woman would believe a
man who says year after year

543
00:34:20.169 --> 00:34:21.904
he's gonna leave his wife.
and he never does it?

544
00:34:21.938 --> 00:34:23.538
You said you wanted
to have a baby with me.

545
00:34:23.571 --> 00:34:25.840
That was a long
time ago. I was drunk!

546
00:34:25.874 --> 00:34:27.542
I could've had a life.

547
00:34:27.575 --> 00:34:28.978
A family.

548
00:34:29.011 --> 00:34:30.079
It's too late now.

549
00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:32.014
Bullshit.

550
00:34:32.982 --> 00:34:36.218
You'd make a horrible.
horrible fuckin' mother.

551
00:34:37.153 --> 00:34:38.921
Good to hear what
you really think of me.

552
00:34:38.955 --> 00:34:39.956
You need to get
the fuck outta here.

553
00:34:39.989 --> 00:34:41.190
Get the fuck outta here.

554
00:34:42.857 --> 00:34:43.858
Anyhow.

555
00:34:46.195 --> 00:34:47.796
we already performed the ritual.

556
00:34:49.664 --> 00:34:51.133
Or most of it. anyway.

557
00:34:52.667 --> 00:34:54.536
What the fuck
you talking about?

558
00:34:54.569 --> 00:34:58.707
Well. it was broken up. but
some of it was we made love.

559
00:34:59.841 --> 00:35:03.045
spun around. I
bundled the twigs.

560
00:35:05.881 --> 00:35:07.984
Oh. but you don't
believe in that stuff.

561
00:35:08.918 --> 00:35:11.753
You need to get
outta here. right now.

562
00:35:14.723 --> 00:35:15.623
Say you love me.

563
00:35:16.791 --> 00:35:18.493
Go to fuckin' hell.

564
00:35:21.796 --> 00:35:22.630
Okay.

565
00:35:24.833 --> 00:35:28.137
Fine. I'll get outta
your fucking life!

566
00:35:28.170 --> 00:35:33.175
Maybe you just want me to jump
outta this fucking window!

567
00:35:33.875 --> 00:35:34.709
Bye!

568
00:36:13.215 --> 00:36:15.084
Have you seen anyone?

569
00:36:15.117 --> 00:36:16.651
Oh. come on.

570
00:36:16.684 --> 00:36:18.187
Those season
tickets. I have 'em.

571
00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:20.923
You can have as many as you
fuckin' want. just tell me.

572
00:36:20.956 --> 00:36:22.091
Have you seen anyone?

573
00:36:23.359 --> 00:36:24.759
Thank you.

574
00:36:24.793 --> 00:36:26.661
And no. I haven't seen anyone.

575
00:36:28.998 --> 00:36:29.932
Thanks.

576
00:36:29.965 --> 00:36:31.599
Good night. Thomas.

577
00:36:31.633 --> 00:36:33.169
Good night.

578
00:36:56.959 --> 00:36:57.859
Thomas.

579
00:36:59.694 --> 00:37:01.863
The last thing I wanted
to do was hurt you.

580
00:37:02.932 --> 00:37:05.901
but it's still on the list.

581
00:37:11.407 --> 00:37:14.642
If I follow through with
the unnameable with you.

582
00:37:17.346 --> 00:37:18.881
you won't be my first.

583
00:37:22.017 --> 00:37:23.285
Are you nuts?

584
00:37:23.319 --> 00:37:25.988
I'm not going in
the park with you!

585
00:39:23.172 --> 00:39:26.008
My cat has never been
gone for that long before.

586
00:39:26.041 --> 00:39:27.343
It's been three weeks.

587
00:39:27.376 --> 00:39:32.348
There's a way. but
it's my premium service.

588
00:39:33.315 --> 00:39:34.749
Okay. that's fine.

589
00:39:36.585 --> 00:39:38.354
Whatever it is.
I'm willing to pay.

590
00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:25.401
Hi Thomas.

591
00:40:25.434 --> 00:40:26.368
Vincent. hey.

592
00:40:26.402 --> 00:40:28.137
Question.

593
00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.139
These security cameras are
all around the building?

594
00:40:30.172 --> 00:40:32.074
Who's in charge of those?

595
00:40:32.107 --> 00:40:33.108
Not me.

596
00:40:33.142 --> 00:40:34.009
No. not you?

597
00:40:34.043 --> 00:40:35.377
Who then?

598
00:40:35.411 --> 00:40:36.612
Well. it
used to be Hector.

599
00:40:36.645 --> 00:40:37.980
Hector.

600
00:40:38.013 --> 00:40:39.847
Who's Hector?

601
00:40:39.882 --> 00:40:41.250
I'm just gonna be straight
with you. the system broke.

602
00:40:41.283 --> 00:40:42.918
It was never replaced.

603
00:40:42.951 --> 00:40:44.453
The cameras are basically
just for show now.

604
00:40:46.455 --> 00:40:47.523
Really?

605
00:40:47.556 --> 00:40:49.191
So it's all bullshit?

606
00:40:49.224 --> 00:40:50.025
Pretty much.

607
00:40:50.059 --> 00:40:51.327
Okay. thanks.

608
00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:52.428
Anytime.

609
00:40:52.461 --> 00:40:53.929
Why are you still in the city?

610
00:40:53.962 --> 00:40:55.464
You'd be proud.
I was a speaker

611
00:40:55.497 --> 00:40:57.966
at the American Board of
Ophthalmology convention today.

612
00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:01.136
I'm like so sorry
I missed that.

613
00:41:01.170 --> 00:41:02.271
So how'd your
science project go?

614
00:41:03.138 --> 00:41:04.006
Mandy!

615
00:41:04.039 --> 00:41:05.074
Oh my god. Dad!

616
00:41:05.107 --> 00:41:06.442
What is going on with you?

617
00:41:06.475 --> 00:41:08.043
I just saw a figure
pass behind you.

618
00:41:08.077 --> 00:41:09.178
Don't joke around like that.

619
00:41:09.211 --> 00:41:10.579
Mandy. it's very immature.

620
00:41:10.612 --> 00:41:12.214
Dad. I wouldn't lie
to you. I promise.

621
00:41:12.247 --> 00:41:14.116
I've had it with
your schoolgirl pranks.

622
00:41:14.149 --> 00:41:15.250
I'm signing off.

623
00:41:17.186 --> 00:41:18.020
Bye bye.

624
00:41:24.526 --> 00:41:26.995
I like being out with
my beautiful wife.

625
00:41:27.029 --> 00:41:28.630
Give me a break.

626
00:41:28.664 --> 00:41:30.566
The only time you compliment
me is when you're wasted.

627
00:41:30.599 --> 00:41:32.167
Come on. I'll drive us upstate.

628
00:41:32.201 --> 00:41:33.135
No.

629
00:41:36.271 --> 00:41:37.139
Why are you drinking?

630
00:41:37.172 --> 00:41:38.507
What happened?

631
00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:41.043
Brenda. I'm having a
glass of wine. I'm fine.

632
00:41:42.511 --> 00:41:43.645
Bullshit.

633
00:41:43.679 --> 00:41:45.514
You never have just one.

634
00:41:45.547 --> 00:41:47.282
Come on.

635
00:41:47.316 --> 00:41:49.451
Look. aren't gonna ask
me how my speech was. hm?

636
00:41:49.485 --> 00:41:51.053
How was your day?

637
00:41:51.086 --> 00:41:56.024
Well. I got a message
from a former patient.

638
00:41:56.959 --> 00:41:58.093
wants to return to therapy.

639
00:41:58.127 --> 00:41:59.928
Oh. and?

640
00:41:59.962 --> 00:42:02.364
And we weren't very
successful a few years ago.

641
00:42:02.398 --> 00:42:04.233
I believe if a patient
reaches out for help.

642
00:42:04.266 --> 00:42:06.168
you should give him
a second chance.

643
00:42:07.035 --> 00:42:09.071
Anyone who thinks
that only someone else

644
00:42:09.104 --> 00:42:11.039
can save them is already lost.

645
00:42:12.274 --> 00:42:13.242
I can't believe
you just said that.

646
00:42:13.275 --> 00:42:14.276
I can't believe it.

647
00:42:14.309 --> 00:42:15.611
Why?

648
00:42:15.644 --> 00:42:17.346
Am I the only one
who can save you?

649
00:42:17.379 --> 00:42:19.982
I just realized. I can't
come upstate with you.

650
00:42:20.983 --> 00:42:22.484
Why?

651
00:42:22.518 --> 00:42:24.953
An emergency surgery
came up. for the morning.

652
00:42:26.622 --> 00:42:28.223
You sure you can do a surgery?

653
00:42:29.324 --> 00:42:31.026
Go upstate.

654
00:42:31.059 --> 00:42:31.960
I don't wanna leave you
when you're like this.

655
00:42:31.994 --> 00:42:33.195
I just wanna be alone.

656
00:42:34.496 --> 00:42:35.330
Please?

657
00:42:36.532 --> 00:42:38.233
You know what?

658
00:42:38.267 --> 00:42:39.101
Fine.

659
00:42:44.506 --> 00:42:45.507
Could I have another?

660
00:42:56.084 --> 00:42:58.220
You must think
about when we first met.

661
00:43:04.026 --> 00:43:05.394
Which one does your wife use?

662
00:43:07.262 --> 00:43:10.032
Look. it's three-three-three.

663
00:43:10.065 --> 00:43:11.333
Won't you pray with me?

664
00:43:11.366 --> 00:43:12.768
We should go in the park.

665
00:43:12.801 --> 00:43:14.369
It's amazing in the dark.

666
00:43:14.403 --> 00:43:16.438
I really wanna give
you my private tour.

667
00:43:16.472 --> 00:43:17.306
Come on.

668
00:43:21.743 --> 00:43:23.045
Follow me.

669
00:43:23.078 --> 00:43:24.246
There's a path back here.

670
00:43:30.285 --> 00:43:33.789
♪ Central Park ♪

671
00:43:33.822 --> 00:43:38.227
♪ Quiet and dark ♪

672
00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:42.130
♪ Circle the fire ♪

673
00:43:42.164 --> 00:43:44.766
♪ Come meet me ♪

674
00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:49.438
♪ When it's three-three-three ♪

675
00:44:14.696 --> 00:44:19.701
Come when I call.

676
00:44:37.419 --> 00:44:40.355
There are so many hidden
symbols in the park.

677
00:44:41.757 --> 00:44:44.359
The Unrequited can
read them. of course.

678
00:44:45.694 --> 00:44:47.563
Sarah Mae was very
close with one

679
00:44:47.596 --> 00:44:49.331
of the architects of the park.

680
00:44:50.499 --> 00:44:51.833
They worshiped together.

681
00:44:53.268 --> 00:44:54.336
I won't tell you which.

682
00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:03.345
I'm a part of a long.
powerful history.

683
00:45:08.383 --> 00:45:12.421
Lifting the Unrequited
Curse has steps.

684
00:45:12.454 --> 00:45:16.325
It starts simply.
ends rather badly.

685
00:45:16.358 --> 00:45:17.359
It's sort of a game.

686
00:45:18.293 --> 00:45:21.430
After all. isn't that
what you played with me?

687
00:45:21.463 --> 00:45:23.365
Or maybe it's more
like a puzzle.

688
00:46:01.503 --> 00:46:03.205
Remember when we
went to the fair?

689
00:46:04.706 --> 00:46:06.308
You won me a teddy bear.

690
00:46:07.709 --> 00:46:09.912
Oh. Thomas. I loved you.

691
00:46:19.488 --> 00:46:23.492
I want you to know I did
struggle with this decision.

692
00:46:24.894 --> 00:46:26.595
But if you
want to lift the curse

693
00:46:26.628 --> 00:46:29.431
and have a baby. it's
time to do the unnameable.

694
00:46:29.464 --> 00:46:31.466
It's Thomas's day of reckoning.

695
00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:33.201
I'd never do
anything like that.

696
00:46:38.473 --> 00:46:39.841
I'd been doing really good.

697
00:46:42.945 --> 00:46:44.646
Okay. fine.

698
00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:45.514
Your way.

699
00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.469
Beloved. I call thee.

700
00:47:08.938 --> 00:47:11.640
Ye heart that longs and yearns.

701
00:47:11.673 --> 00:47:14.810
Love unrequited. twice burns.

702
00:47:14.843 --> 00:47:17.947
Only sacrifice or new
life cures the pain.

703
00:47:19.314 --> 00:47:21.416
Then you return
to thyself again.

704
00:47:21.450 --> 00:47:23.285
Follow the dark
towards eternity.

705
00:47:24.419 --> 00:47:26.488
Listen. the ground
is calling me.

706
00:47:26.521 --> 00:47:28.623
The ground is calling me.

707
00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:23.512
Got it.

708
00:48:40.829 --> 00:48:41.830
Thomas.

709
00:48:41.863 --> 00:48:42.864
- Hey.
- The usual?

710
00:48:44.901 --> 00:48:47.669
Tommy boy.
so great to see you.

711
00:48:47.702 --> 00:48:49.571
Hey. retirement is fabulous.

712
00:48:50.806 --> 00:48:53.642
Sometimes Eddie lets
me watch the news here

713
00:48:53.675 --> 00:48:54.576
instead of at home.

714
00:48:59.681 --> 00:49:00.582
What is it?

715
00:49:01.616 --> 00:49:03.019
Start from the beginning.

716
00:49:03.052 --> 00:49:06.688
Eddie. can you turn
the news down. please?

717
00:49:06.721 --> 00:49:07.556
My hearing.

718
00:49:08.623 --> 00:49:09.791
George. can I trust you?

719
00:49:09.825 --> 00:49:10.759
Absolutely.

720
00:49:11.726 --> 00:49:13.461
I fucked up.

721
00:49:13.495 --> 00:49:14.763
I mean. at your retirement
party. I met this girl.

722
00:49:14.796 --> 00:49:16.865
And I thought it
was only gonna be

723
00:49:16.899 --> 00:49:19.768
like a one night thing. but
it's continued. you know.

724
00:49:19.801 --> 00:49:20.903
She won't stop calling me-

725
00:49:21.870 --> 00:49:23.139
- Doctor. hold on.

726
00:49:23.172 --> 00:49:25.107
I need something stronger.

727
00:49:28.543 --> 00:49:29.444
You fucked up. Tommy.

728
00:49:29.477 --> 00:49:30.545
I did.

729
00:49:30.579 --> 00:49:31.780
Yeah.

730
00:49:31.813 --> 00:49:33.049
Now listen to me clearly.

731
00:49:34.150 --> 00:49:35.717
If you wanna save your marriage-

732
00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:38.087
- I do.
- Mea culpa. mea culpa.

733
00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.821
Tell Brenda now.

734
00:49:39.855 --> 00:49:40.755
I don't think I can.

735
00:49:40.789 --> 00:49:42.691
Fuck your ego. Tommy.

736
00:49:44.826 --> 00:49:46.795
You could lose everything.

737
00:49:46.828 --> 00:49:48.130
Okay.

738
00:49:48.164 --> 00:49:49.431
I'm gonna tell her.

739
00:49:56.105 --> 00:49:58.773
Hey. your girlfriend. I mean
your blonde friend was here.

740
00:49:58.807 --> 00:50:01.376
She said she'll meet you
at the pond at 11 p.m.

741
00:50:02.644 --> 00:50:04.446
What?

742
00:50:04.479 --> 00:50:05.647
She said meet her at the
pond at 11 p.m.. as planned.

743
00:50:06.883 --> 00:50:07.816
Okay. thanks.

744
00:50:07.849 --> 00:50:08.717
Thank you. Vincent.

745
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:10.119
You're welcome.

746
00:52:03.565 --> 00:52:05.767
Hi. it's Thomas.

747
00:52:08.037 --> 00:52:10.139
I'm not feeling
well. I have the flu.

748
00:52:10.172 --> 00:52:13.009
Would you have Roberts
take my calls today?

749
00:52:13.042 --> 00:52:15.311
I'm sure I'll feel
better tomorrow. thanks.

750
00:52:15.344 --> 00:52:16.178
Bye.

751
00:53:30.219 --> 00:53:32.121
Wow. I'm just in my
own world. I guess.

752
00:53:32.154 --> 00:53:35.057
Yeah. exactly why I thought
I'd come and see you tonight.

753
00:53:35.091 --> 00:53:37.993
I have a few
appointments tomorrow.

754
00:53:38.027 --> 00:53:40.029
I thought you'd
appreciate the company.

755
00:53:40.062 --> 00:53:42.264
That's great. honey.

756
00:53:42.298 --> 00:53:43.332
I haven't been drinking.

757
00:53:45.334 --> 00:53:49.704
I'm your wife. I'm not your
babysitter or your sponsor.

758
00:53:49.737 --> 00:53:51.073
I know.

759
00:53:51.107 --> 00:53:52.174
I know.

760
00:53:52.208 --> 00:53:53.042
Listen.

761
00:53:54.276 --> 00:53:55.777
I'm sorry about the other night.

762
00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:57.880
I'm starting at day
one again. okay?

763
00:53:57.913 --> 00:53:58.981
I'm glad to hear it.

764
00:54:03.919 --> 00:54:05.221
Oh. how'd those get so dirty?

765
00:54:06.989 --> 00:54:09.058
I wasn't wearing 'em.

766
00:54:09.091 --> 00:54:10.993
Certainly not my style.

767
00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:21.137
You know. Mandy called
me in an absolute fright

768
00:54:21.170 --> 00:54:23.038
about your Skype
call the other night.

769
00:54:24.106 --> 00:54:25.908
She was pranking me.

770
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:28.444
I'm just not tolerating
that kind of thing.

771
00:54:28.477 --> 00:54:30.745
I don't think she'd do that.

772
00:54:30.778 --> 00:54:31.914
She's a teenager now.

773
00:54:33.282 --> 00:54:34.116
And?

774
00:54:35.850 --> 00:54:37.219
I don't know.

775
00:54:37.253 --> 00:54:40.222
Thomas. she sounded
really frightened.

776
00:55:13.189 --> 00:55:14.056
Kiss me.

777
00:55:16.458 --> 00:55:18.060
Tear me apart.

778
00:55:41.217 --> 00:55:42.952
The heart that longs and yearns.

779
00:55:42.985 --> 00:55:44.386
love unrequited twice burns.

780
00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:47.089
Only sacrifice or new
life cures the pain.

781
00:55:47.122 --> 00:55:48.790
Then you return to thyself.

782
00:55:48.823 --> 00:55:50.125
Follow the dark
towards eternity.

783
00:55:50.159 --> 00:55:52.860
Listen. the ground
is calling thee.

784
00:55:58.100 --> 00:56:00.302
Follow the dark.
follow the dark.

785
00:56:00.336 --> 00:56:02.770
Only sacrifice or new life.

786
00:56:06.342 --> 00:56:08.510
Shh. you'll wake the baby.

787
00:56:19.955 --> 00:56:21.156
Thomas.

788
00:56:21.190 --> 00:56:22.358
What's wrong?

789
00:56:22.391 --> 00:56:24.426
I had a nightmare.

790
00:56:28.830 --> 00:56:31.533
Jesus. I'll get
you some aspirin.

791
00:56:45.247 --> 00:56:46.248
What's this?

792
00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:50.052
It's a little trinket I found.

793
00:56:50.085 --> 00:56:52.221
I thought you'd like it.

794
00:56:53.622 --> 00:56:55.124
I like
your wrapping paper.

795
00:56:57.259 --> 00:56:58.394
It reminds me of something.

796
00:57:02.864 --> 00:57:04.333
Let's just try to
get some sleep.

797
00:57:14.209 --> 00:57:16.178
Hello.

798
00:57:16.211 --> 00:57:18.914
You're still in bed?

799
00:57:18.947 --> 00:57:20.316
I'm catching up on some rest.

800
00:57:20.349 --> 00:57:22.084
Well. you
probably needed it.

801
00:57:22.117 --> 00:57:23.919
Most of the night you were
shouting bloody murder.

802
00:57:23.952 --> 00:57:25.287
I had some intense nightmares.

803
00:57:25.321 --> 00:57:27.222
What do you
think brought these on?

804
00:57:28.490 --> 00:57:29.625
Don't shrink me.

805
00:57:29.658 --> 00:57:31.460
I wasn't.

806
00:57:31.493 --> 00:57:33.929
Well. get your lazy
bones out of bed.

807
00:57:33.962 --> 00:57:35.597
I'm getting up.

808
00:57:35.631 --> 00:57:37.232
You're finally
coming upstate tonight. right?

809
00:57:37.266 --> 00:57:39.201
Yeah. yes. this evening.

810
00:57:39.234 --> 00:57:41.970
Okay. love you.

811
00:58:04.026 --> 00:58:05.594
Hey. excuse me.

812
00:58:05.627 --> 00:58:07.129
Oh. no. I was just wondering
when the church is open?

813
00:58:07.162 --> 00:58:08.564
The church?

814
00:58:08.597 --> 00:58:10.065
They turn this
building into condos now.

815
00:58:10.099 --> 00:58:10.899
Really?

816
00:58:10.933 --> 00:58:12.000
Yeah.

817
00:58:12.034 --> 00:58:13.001
Where were you all this time?

818
00:58:13.035 --> 00:58:14.303
I wanted to see a priest.

819
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:16.238
Can't help ya.

820
00:58:16.271 --> 00:58:17.272
They're not good anyhow.

821
00:58:17.306 --> 00:58:18.140
No?

822
00:58:19.341 --> 00:58:20.309
Nobody is. right?

823
00:58:23.078 --> 00:58:24.613
Hey.

824
00:58:24.646 --> 00:58:26.648
Mom says you think I was
playing a trick on you.

825
00:58:26.682 --> 00:58:28.550
Not true.

826
00:58:28.584 --> 00:58:30.185
I'm happy to see my
beautiful daughter.

827
00:58:30.219 --> 00:58:32.187

Hello. I'm
calling about your services.

845
01:00:52.127 --> 01:00:53.529
This is Sarah Mae.

846
01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.302
Shall we begin?

847
01:01:00.335 --> 01:01:01.770
Yes.

848
01:01:01.803 --> 01:01:03.272
Are
there any spirits

849
01:01:03.305 --> 01:01:05.641
who would like to
speak to Thomas?

850
01:01:06.842 --> 01:01:07.676
Anna!

851
01:01:13.715 --> 01:01:15.150
I'm not getting anything.

852
01:01:15.851 --> 01:01:19.187
Okay. so what do we do now?

853
01:01:20.589 --> 01:01:21.857
We should leave.

854
01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:22.758
Already?

855
01:01:22.791 --> 01:01:24.326
Yes.

856
01:01:24.359 --> 01:01:25.661
Okay.

857
01:01:25.694 --> 01:01:26.495
Okay.

858
01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:30.165
I'm
sorry. these things

859
01:01:30.198 --> 01:01:32.267
are not an exact science.

860
01:01:32.301 --> 01:01:35.404
Yeah. maybe it was all.
you know. just in my head.

861
01:01:47.816 --> 01:01:49.318
Do you promise not to yell?

862
01:01:49.351 --> 01:01:50.719
Okay.

863
01:01:50.752 --> 01:01:51.888
So I remembered
what my mother buried.

864
01:01:51.921 --> 01:01:53.322
Can you guess?

865
01:01:53.355 --> 01:01:54.623
A body?

866
01:01:54.656 --> 01:01:55.624
Whose?

867
01:01:55.657 --> 01:01:57.259
Why?

868
01:01:57.292 --> 01:01:58.093
I've no idea.

869
01:01:59.361 --> 01:02:02.397
Well. you have time
to think about it.

870
01:02:03.665 --> 01:02:04.766
A little time. anyway.

871
01:02:06.268 --> 01:02:08.270
You think you're gonna
actually dig a grave?

872
01:02:09.838 --> 01:02:11.406
What are you doing?

873
01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:13.508
Nothing you could
possibly understand.

874
01:02:13.542 --> 01:02:14.843
Untie me.

875
01:02:14.876 --> 01:02:16.378
Let me go. please.

876
01:02:17.346 --> 01:02:19.514
Your voice is getting
too loud for my taste.

877
01:02:22.284 --> 01:02:23.118
Anyway.

878
01:02:24.519 --> 01:02:25.354
Hey.

879
01:02:26.388 --> 01:02:27.689
It was great seeing you again.

880
01:02:29.458 --> 01:02:31.493
Now you can do whatever
you wanna do to me.

881
01:02:31.526 --> 01:02:32.494
I intend to.

882
01:02:32.527 --> 01:02:33.795
I don't need your approval.

883
01:02:35.497 --> 01:02:37.733
But I just want you
to know something. Anna.

884
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:40.402
I always cared about you.

885
01:02:41.536 --> 01:02:42.604
Always.

886
01:02:42.638 --> 01:02:44.439
It wasn't just a front for me.

887
01:02:49.378 --> 01:02:50.812
You're just saying that now.

888
01:02:50.846 --> 01:02:55.417
But when I first met you.
I knew you were special.

889
01:02:56.518 --> 01:02:57.386
Special how?

890
01:02:58.253 --> 01:02:59.521
That you
were the one for me.

891
01:02:59.554 --> 01:03:01.256
That it was my destiny.

892
01:03:03.859 --> 01:03:05.594
You don't believe
in that stuff.

893
01:03:05.627 --> 01:03:06.695
I believe in us.

894
01:03:08.563 --> 01:03:09.431
Do you mean that?

895
01:03:10.499 --> 01:03:11.366
Yes. I do.

896
01:03:12.401 --> 01:03:14.904
I'm a really great person
once you get to know me.

897
01:03:14.937 --> 01:03:15.938
I know that. Anna.

898
01:03:17.339 --> 01:03:21.777
I will leave Brenda
like I promised you.

899
01:03:22.778 --> 01:03:24.646
We'll have a big fancy
dinner tomorrow night

900
01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:26.248
at your favorite spot.

901
01:03:26.281 --> 01:03:27.549
Wear a dress.

902
01:03:27.582 --> 01:03:29.384
Although you always look pretty.

903
01:03:32.254 --> 01:03:33.221
Untie me. please.

904
01:03:35.657 --> 01:03:36.491
Untie me.

905
01:03:37.459 --> 01:03:39.795
Can I just come
home with you tonight?

906
01:03:41.396 --> 01:03:43.532
No. I
wanna do this right.

907
01:03:43.565 --> 01:03:44.833
Tomorrow night. where?

908
01:03:44.866 --> 01:03:47.469
Chez Jean Pierre. 7:00 p.m.

909
01:03:48.704 --> 01:03:50.472
Hey. hey. don't follow me.

910
01:03:50.505 --> 01:03:51.740
Go before I change my mind.

911
01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.481
I have a date.

912
01:04:00.549 --> 01:04:02.617
Something to take the edge off?

913
01:04:04.987 --> 01:04:08.590
Once you told me that
if I wish upon a star.

914
01:04:10.692 --> 01:04:12.260
I'm millions of years too late.

915
01:04:16.966 --> 01:04:19.568
This one's on me.

916
01:04:22.537 --> 01:04:24.506
This is war. my dear.

917
01:04:27.043 --> 01:04:27.876
And Mandy.

918
01:04:40.990 --> 01:04:42.657
Yes. I'm sorry. go ahead.

919
01:05:07.582 --> 01:05:11.720
Thomas. I just
wanted to make sure

920
01:05:11.753 --> 01:05:14.322
you weren't running
late or something.

921
01:05:14.991 --> 01:05:15.824
Call me.

922
01:05:17.459 --> 01:05:19.028
Don't you
remember what I told you?

923
01:05:19.061 --> 01:05:22.731
So now your curse can only
be lifted by a new life.

924
01:05:22.764 --> 01:05:24.533
- A baby?
- Yes.

925
01:05:24.566 --> 01:05:25.935
Or you could
sacrifice a young virgin.

926
01:05:25.968 --> 01:05:28.070
which I'm sure
you're not up for.

927
01:05:40.649 --> 01:05:43.652
Oh. thank god you're here.

928
01:05:43.685 --> 01:05:45.387
Don't!

929
01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:46.755
I've not been feeling well.

930
01:05:46.788 --> 01:05:48.557
I figured out who
this belonged to.

931
01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:50.525
It's a pretty sick gift. Thomas.

932
01:05:50.559 --> 01:05:52.094
I'm sorry.

933
01:05:52.128 --> 01:05:53.029
I don't even know who
the hell you are anymore.

934
01:05:56.098 --> 01:05:57.866
I'm ashamed to be
married to someone

935
01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:00.669
who's attracted to such a
terribly disturbed person.

936
01:06:00.702 --> 01:06:03.405
Brenda. I'm so. so sorry.

937
01:06:03.438 --> 01:06:06.108
She was a client of
mine two years ago.

938
01:06:06.142 --> 01:06:07.642
I had no idea.

939
01:06:07.676 --> 01:06:09.111
Well she did.

940
01:06:09.145 --> 01:06:11.413
Anna was enraged when
I ended our sessions.

941
01:06:11.446 --> 01:06:12.781
I told her she had
to stop drinking

942
01:06:12.814 --> 01:06:13.883
if she wanted our
therapy to continue.

943
01:06:13.916 --> 01:06:15.517
and I knew that she couldn't.

944
01:06:16.418 --> 01:06:18.087
I hated our sessions.

945
01:06:18.120 --> 01:06:19.788
She believed she was a witch.

946
01:06:21.123 --> 01:06:22.591
Now that I do believe.

947
01:06:22.624 --> 01:06:23.893
You have clearly
fucking lost it!

948
01:06:23.926 --> 01:06:25.427
Brenda. I swear. I-

949
01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:26.595
- I don't wanna
see you ever again.

950
01:06:27.997 --> 01:06:29.531
Let's talk. you tell
your patients to forgive.

951
01:06:29.564 --> 01:06:30.632
Oh. don't you dare!

952
01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:33.002
Go to hell. Thomas.

953
01:06:33.035 --> 01:06:34.703
I need you. Brenda.

954
01:06:34.736 --> 01:06:36.105
Don't come near me.

955
01:06:37.173 --> 01:06:39.141
Just realized something.

956
01:06:39.175 --> 01:06:40.977
I'm free of you.

957
01:06:42.577 --> 01:06:44.713
Oh Brenda. please don't go!

958
01:07:29.959 --> 01:07:32.895
Hello?

959
01:07:34.663 --> 01:07:35.463
Dad?

960
01:07:38.767 --> 01:07:39.601
Hey. Vincent.

961
01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:43.538
Don't smoke.

962
01:07:43.571 --> 01:07:45.174
Have you seen my father?

963
01:07:45.207 --> 01:07:48.710
No. but he's been spending
a lot of time in the park.

964
01:07:48.743 --> 01:07:49.744
Okay.

965
01:07:49.778 --> 01:07:50.645
Well don't go there now.

966
01:07:50.679 --> 01:07:51.713
It's way too late.

967
01:08:08.830 --> 01:08:09.731
Excuse me?

968
01:08:10.865 --> 01:08:14.836
Have you seen a man. 50 years
old. six feet. black hair?

969
01:08:17.239 --> 01:08:18.074
Sorry. no.

970
01:08:19.841 --> 01:08:22.744
Do you speak to spirits?

971
01:08:23.812 --> 01:08:25.081
Not always.

972
01:08:25.114 --> 01:08:26.781
I think my father
has some like

973
01:08:26.815 --> 01:08:29.584
otherworldly things
happening to him.

974
01:08:29.617 --> 01:08:30.987
Your father is in great pain.

975
01:08:31.988 --> 01:08:33.990
Do you know
where I can find him?

976
01:08:36.959 --> 01:08:38.560
Yes. Thomas. Mandy came here.

977
01:08:38.593 --> 01:08:40.262
I think she went looking
for you in the park.

978
01:08:40.296 --> 01:08:41.563
Okay look. I need
you to go in the back

979
01:08:41.596 --> 01:08:42.831
and give me the gun back there.

980
01:08:42.864 --> 01:08:44.233
What?

981
01:08:44.266 --> 01:08:45.935
I don't have time for
this bullshit. Vincent.

982
01:08:45.968 --> 01:08:46.868
Go in the back and get me
that gun and give it to me.

983
01:08:46.902 --> 01:08:47.802
We got rid of it.

984
01:08:47.836 --> 01:08:49.205
You did?

985
01:08:49.238 --> 01:08:50.106
Fuckin' Christ.

986
01:08:51.207 --> 01:08:53.608
Oh. flashlight.

987
01:08:53.641 --> 01:08:54.276
Yeah.

988
01:09:08.224 --> 01:09:09.791
I'm so
glad I ran into you.

989
01:09:13.628 --> 01:09:15.898
I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret.

990
01:09:15.931 --> 01:09:17.233
Okay.

991
01:09:17.266 --> 01:09:18.533
The ground
is calling you.

992
01:09:23.372 --> 01:09:25.807
Get away from me!

993
01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:30.079
No. please!

994
01:09:30.112 --> 01:09:31.047
No. please.

995
01:09:45.995 --> 01:09:47.363
Walk around the candles.

996
01:09:47.396 --> 01:09:48.230
Please. no!

997
01:09:50.665 --> 01:09:52.935
You think about making
a run for it. you're done.

998
01:09:52.968 --> 01:09:53.802
Walk faster.

999
01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:58.873
Walk faster.

1000
01:10:03.045 --> 01:10:03.878
Ow.

1001
01:10:05.114 --> 01:10:06.949
I hurt my ankle.

1002
01:10:06.982 --> 01:10:07.849
Please. help me.

1003
01:10:11.887 --> 01:10:12.854
Ow.

1004
01:10:15.991 --> 01:10:16.858
Please. help!

1005
01:10:18.693 --> 01:10:20.062
Please. help.

1006
01:10:20.096 --> 01:10:21.263
Okay.

1007
01:10:21.297 --> 01:10:22.730
All right. I'll help you.

1008
01:10:27.069 --> 01:10:28.971
Ow. my ankle.

1009
01:10:31.140 --> 01:10:32.208
Use this as a crutch.

1010
01:10:32.241 --> 01:10:33.909
Don't put any weight on it.

1011
01:10:33.943 --> 01:10:35.010
Go.

1012
01:10:35.044 --> 01:10:36.878
Go. and call your dad.

1013
01:10:36.912 --> 01:10:37.880
Okay.

1014
01:10:54.063 --> 01:10:54.863
Oh my god.

1015
01:11:07.109 --> 01:11:10.246
When she hurt her
ankle. I had to help her.

1016
01:11:10.279 --> 01:11:12.948
In the end I guess I
did the right thing.

1017
01:11:12.982 --> 01:11:15.050
I'm a decent human being.

1018
01:11:15.084 --> 01:11:16.051
Are you decent?

1019
01:11:16.085 --> 01:11:18.820
Are you human?

1020
01:11:18.853 --> 01:11:20.788
Either way. your curse remains.

1021
01:12:10.439 --> 01:12:11.739
- Tom. Thomas?
- Hey.

1022
01:12:11.773 --> 01:12:13.042
Hey.

1023
01:12:13.075 --> 01:12:13.841
Can I give you
a hand with that?

1024
01:12:13.875 --> 01:12:14.776
Oh no. no. no.

1025
01:12:14.809 --> 01:12:16.145
No. I'm exercising.

1026
01:12:16.178 --> 01:12:17.446
It's just heavy. you
don't wanna do it.

1027
01:12:17.479 --> 01:12:18.746
you'll hurt your
back or something.

1028
01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:19.781
All right. Thomas.

1029
01:12:19.814 --> 01:12:20.748
You have a nice evening.

1030
01:12:20.782 --> 01:12:21.417
You too.

1031
01:12:52.081 --> 01:12:53.015
Oh. fuck.

1032
01:13:02.558 --> 01:13:03.926
Okay. come on.

1033
01:13:19.174 --> 01:13:20.442
Hey Mandy. it's your father.

1034
01:13:20.476 --> 01:13:22.144
I just got a missed
call from you.

1035
01:13:22.177 --> 01:13:23.579
and I was hoping you'd call
me back as soon as you can

1036
01:13:23.612 --> 01:13:25.414
and let me know that
you're okay. okay hon?

1037
01:13:42.264 --> 01:13:44.600
No!

1038
01:13:44.633 --> 01:13:45.467
Mandy.

1039
01:13:49.271 --> 01:13:50.572
Forgive me. honey.

1040
01:13:55.477 --> 01:13:56.612
Honey. I'm okay.

1041
01:13:56.645 --> 01:14:01.283
I mean. oh.

1042
01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:05.321
I need help.

1043
01:15:19.361 --> 01:15:21.029
What did the
blonde say when she

1044
01:15:21.063 --> 01:15:22.464
found out that she was pregnant?

1045
01:15:24.099 --> 01:15:25.167
"Are you sure it's mine?"

1046
01:15:37.346 --> 01:15:38.180
Hey.

1047
01:15:41.316 --> 01:15:43.152
Get out of here.

1048
01:15:43.185 --> 01:15:44.319
Get out of here!

1049
01:20:02.477 --> 01:20:04.312
After several
months' investigation

1050
01:20:04.346 --> 01:20:05.847
into the seven men
who have gone missing

1051
01:20:05.882 --> 01:20:08.684
in Central Park's bramble.
a clue has emerged.

1052
01:20:08.717 --> 01:20:11.520
Authorities have asked that
if you see anything like this.

1053
01:20:11.553 --> 01:20:12.922
notify them immediately.

1054
01:20:12.955 --> 01:20:13.923
Back to you.
