Did I ever tell you about my first call?

14
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.210
[Policeman] No.

15
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.908
Domestic disturbance.

17
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.919

Dog shit everywhere.

00:02:01.695 --> 00:02:03.295
At least I hope it was dog shit.

I never saw a dog.

24
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.170
Turned out to be a bunch
of fucking tweakers.

25
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.520
Had set up a meth lab in
the bathroom upstairs.

26
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.143
Doesn't sound very sanitary.

34
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.269
I'm not a believer. I'm a knower.

35
00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:12.268
I know Bigfoots exist.

36
00:03:12.268 --> 00:03:16.710
That's because of my first
hand eyewitness accounting

37
00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.110
right here in these very woods.

38
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.720
I mean. I saw it dead in the eyes.

39
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.730
But people. they dismiss me.

40
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.387
They say stuff like. "Oh. if they exist.

41
00:03:25.387 --> 00:03:28.020
"then where are all
the bones. the bodies?"

42
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.730
But maybe that's just it.

43
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.350
Maybe the reason we
can't find these Bigfoots

44
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.410
is because they're not Bigfoots
all the time. you know.

45
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.263
like sort of werewolf type situation.

46
00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.310
Yeah. I hear some say it could be

47
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.410
a paranormal aspect to 'em.

48
00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.883
Don't encourage him. Jared.

49
00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:51.170
I mean maybe. maybe it is paranormal.

50
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.990
But I even heard the other own language.

51
00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:56.670
And if they communicate
like we do. I mean.

52
00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:00.360
who's to say they're not
more advanced than we are?

53
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.890
Maybe the reason we
can't find these things

54
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.540
is because they're just
smarter than us. bottom line.

55
00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.350
Well. that's not much of a stretch.

56
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.210
Don't be like that.

57
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.043
I'm telling you Les.

58
00:04:10.043 --> 00:04:12.450
it's just trouble every
which way over here.

59
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.633
Think I'm about to give
up on woman for good.

60
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.310
- Well. on behalf of women
everywhere I say. thanks.

61
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.620

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.323
What was that?

189
00:11:23.970 --> 00:11:26.040
Ah. Les?

190
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:27.420
That sounds like gunshots.

191
00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.530
Maybe they're hunting Bigfoot.

192
00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.980
- Probably those Sanders
kids with their M80s.

193
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:33.810
Those goddamn brats.

194
00:11:33.810 --> 00:11:36.720
It's not New Year's Eve. damn Gen X or Y

195
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.211
or whatever fucking number we're on now.

196
00:11:39.211 --> 00:11:41.961
(dramatic music)

197
00:11:47.956 --> 00:11:50.220
(gun firing)

198
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.383
Okay. that was a fucking gun.

199
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:55.470
Les. just call the cops.

200
00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.110
Come on Billy. don't be a hero.

201
00:11:58.110 --> 00:11:59.063
Les don't.

202
00:12:09.796 --> 00:12:12.213
(gun firing)

203
00:12:34.994 --> 00:12:36.411
Well fuck this.

204
00:12:38.549 --> 00:12:41.299
(dramatic music)

205
00:12:49.186 --> 00:12:51.972
(guns firing)

206
00:12:51.972 --> 00:12:54.389
Fuck all you motherfuckers.

207
00:12:56.112 --> 00:12:57.930
What the hell?

208
00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:58.763
Whoopsie.

209
00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.274
[Gail] Close that door.

210
00:13:04.274 --> 00:13:07.024
(dramatic music)

211
00:13:08.533 --> 00:13:10.931
(door slamming)

212
00:13:10.931 --> 00:13:13.681
(dramatic music)

213
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.279
You killed her.

214
00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:25.946
(Shiloh crying)

215
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.803
- I'm sorry for your last
honey but it wasn't us.

216
00:13:32.151 --> 00:13:34.017
Well then who?

217
00:13:34.017 --> 00:13:36.767
(dramatic music)

218
00:13:54.638 --> 00:13:56.370
They're barricading us in.

219
00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:58.440
Why would they do that?

220
00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.290
Check the back.

221
00:14:00.687 --> 00:14:03.437
(dramatic music)

222
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:07.320
[Will] We need to lock this.

223
00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:11.680
Fuck.

224
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:14.430
(dramatic music)

225
00:14:16.366 --> 00:14:17.453
Frank's out there.

226
00:14:17.453 --> 00:14:19.510
Oh fuck Frank.

227
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:21.840
(dramatic music)

228
00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.820
[Frank] What the hell people want?

229
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:25.680
You should be honored.

230
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:30.680
You are going to purge
this world of a great evil.

231
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.339
Now what the hell is this?

232
00:14:33.339 --> 00:14:36.089
(dramatic music)

233
00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:57.713
She's gone.

234
00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.253
You need to get over
there with your friends.

235
00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:03.410
I'm not leaving her.

236
00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:07.500
(dramatic music)

237
00:15:10.230 --> 00:15:11.493
She isn't asking.

238
00:15:12.698 --> 00:15:16.170
(dramatic music)

239
00:15:16.170 --> 00:15:17.770
- I'm not moving.
- Wait. wait.

240
00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:20.373
Come on Shiloh.

241
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:25.053
Let's go. come on.

242
00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:28.468
Please.

243
00:15:28.468 --> 00:15:31.051
(gentle music)

244
00:15:54.926 --> 00:15:57.759
So are you guys like robbing us?

245
00:15:59.928 --> 00:16:02.928
(telephone ringing)

246
00:16:03.889 --> 00:16:04.722
Don't.

247
00:16:07.763 --> 00:16:09.030
(telephone ringing)

248
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.863
No. wait.

249
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.233
What?

250
00:16:19.363 --> 00:16:21.267
(dramatic music)

251
00:16:21.267 --> 00:16:25.746
Can we cover her up. please?

252
00:16:25.746 --> 00:16:28.329
(gentle music)

253
00:16:53.836 --> 00:16:55.090
You okay.

254
00:16:55.090 --> 00:16:56.160
Yeah.

255
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.823
You girl. over with the others.

256
00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:02.870
It means you too. dude.

257
00:17:04.456 --> 00:17:07.039
(gentle music)

258
00:17:09.450 --> 00:17:10.283
What now?

259
00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:12.452
Just.

260
00:17:14.250 --> 00:17:18.693
just take a breath. okay. reassess.

261
00:17:22.299 --> 00:17:24.840
(dramatic music)

262
00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:28.833
Hey. you keep your hands where
I can see 'em. all of you.

263
00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:34.613
Frenzy.

264
00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:38.370
check the dorks pockets.

265
00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:39.213
Which one?

266
00:17:41.531 --> 00:17:44.281
(dramatic music)

267
00:17:57.621 --> 00:18:00.454
(Frenzy laughing)

268
00:18:03.091 --> 00:18:04.174
I got this.

269
00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:09.490
Quit fucking around.

270
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:13.323
And I liked you.

271
00:18:14.978 --> 00:18:17.728
(Frenzy purring)

272
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.303
What are we waiting for?

273
00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.623
It's vulnerable after it feeds.

274
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.200
We gotta make a move.

275
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:30.180
We can't let 'em trap us in here.

276
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:31.740
Too late.

277
00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:33.420
- Guys. the cops are probably
on their way right now.

278
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.490
I mean. they must have
heard all this noise.

279
00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:36.603
Way out here?

280
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:39.500
What do you people want with us?

281
00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:42.120
What was that?

282
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:42.953
Stop.

283
00:18:42.953 --> 00:18:44.490
Let's see how much you talk

284
00:18:44.490 --> 00:18:46.653
when I cut your fucking throat out.

285
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:49.233
Hang it up.

286
00:18:50.928 --> 00:18:53.670
(dramatic music)

287
00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:56.313
Okay. I was just trying to make a point.

288
00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.197
What are we gonna do?

289
00:19:04.179 --> 00:19:06.929
(dramatic music)

290
00:19:53.073 --> 00:19:54.673
[Carl] Now. do you understand?

291
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.910
Why don't we just tie 'em all up?

292
00:19:59.910 --> 00:20:01.323
They're not gonna do shit.

293
00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:05.313
(gentle music)

294
00:20:06.210 --> 00:20:07.440
It's clear.

295
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.543
No windows. no doors.

296
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:17.280
- Maybe. maybe we take a
couple of the hostages.

297
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:19.380
stage the distraction at the front.

298
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:20.880
make a break through the back.

299
00:20:22.260 --> 00:20:23.550
Are you crazy?

300
00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:26.160
They'll mow us down
with the other hostages.

301
00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.720
Hostages?

302
00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:28.953
I can't be a hostage.

303
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:31.996
I'm a DJ.

304
00:20:31.996 --> 00:20:34.579
(gentle music)

305
00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.490
Go calm the fuck down.

306
00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:39.323
Shut up.

307
00:20:40.935 --> 00:20:43.518
(Will gasping)

308
00:20:46.824 --> 00:20:48.030
Breathe.

309
00:20:48.030 --> 00:20:48.863
Just breathe.

310
00:20:49.962 --> 00:20:53.672
You can handle this. okay. just breathe.

311
00:20:53.672 --> 00:20:56.255
(gentle music)

312
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:58.563
Hey. where's the monitor?

313
00:21:00.330 --> 00:21:01.680
The monitor for the camera?

314
00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:05.283
Behind the bar.

315
00:21:17.232 --> 00:21:19.982
(dramatic music)

316
00:21:33.578 --> 00:21:35.644

(dramatic music)

320
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:48.267
The fuck are they doing?

321
00:21:48.267 --> 00:21:51.017
(dramatic music)

322
00:21:53.623 --> 00:21:54.456
(insects chirping)

323
00:21:54.456 --> 00:21:55.289
(dramatic music)

324
00:21:55.289 --> 00:21:56.283
Your time is up.

325
00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.880
(dramatic music)

326
00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.713
Oh shit.

327
00:22:03.690 --> 00:22:04.540
What's happening?

328
00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.138
Are they coming in?

329
00:22:08.138 --> 00:22:09.660
(Frenzy laughing)

330
00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:10.650
Shut up. Frenzy.

331
00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.693
How y'all doing in there?

332
00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:17.223
Hope y'all are nice and comfy.

333
00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:21.300
Now. it may come as no surprise to you

334
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.240
that you are surrounded.

335
00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:28.050
The entrances and the exits are sealed.

336
00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.940
And we got men on both.

337
00:22:29.940 --> 00:22:32.013
in case you manage to break on through.

338
00:22:33.088 --> 00:22:35.354
What the living fuck.

339
00:22:35.354 --> 00:22:37.332
He's gonna come in here.

340
00:22:37.332 --> 00:22:38.165
He's gonna.

341
00:22:38.165 --> 00:22:40.440
- Now what may come as a
revelation to some of you

342
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:45.183
is that there is a killer. a
straight up monster among you.

343
00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:47.970
Killed a lot of folk.

344
00:22:47.970 --> 00:22:50.279
What's he mean. monster?

345
00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:52.890
(dramatic music)

346
00:22:52.890 --> 00:22:55.920
Now this is where you come in.

347
00:22:55.920 --> 00:23:00.210
Now all you gotta do is knock real loud

348
00:23:00.210 --> 00:23:03.960
and let us know you're
ready to give him up.

349
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.050
And after that you can just walk away

350
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:10.803
and let us do the rest.

351
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.657
We got no quarrel with you.

352
00:23:15.657 --> 00:23:17.223
You got one hour.

353
00:23:18.625 --> 00:23:19.830
(gentle music)

354
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:20.680
I don't get it.

355
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:22.470
What do they want?

356
00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:26.622
(gentle music)

357
00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:36.437
This is not going to end well.

No.

364
00:23:59.163 --> 00:24:00.456
It's not gonna happen.

No. no. no. no. please.

377
00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:21.930
- You should really look
at that checked out.

378
00:25:21.930 --> 00:25:24.150
You know I went to the
doc about two years ago.

379
00:25:24.150 --> 00:25:26.547
He said. "You're borderline diabetic."

380
00:25:27.390 --> 00:25:30.210
You know I love me some sweets.

381
00:25:30.210 --> 00:25:33.150
In college. oh. I could tear up

382
00:25:33.150 --> 00:25:35.043
a good German chocolate cake.

383
00:25:36.210 --> 00:25:37.923
I don't touch that shit anymore.

384
00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.913
Now I'm the paradigm of self-control.

385
00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:50.180
Take that basic bitch in the other room.

386
00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:56.810
This dumb ass have a nerve to question me.

387
00:25:56.880 --> 00:25:59.250
The old me would've faded that bitch

388
00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:00.700
right fucking then and there.

389
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.613
But I came up with an alternative.

390
00:26:08.422 --> 00:26:10.110
(laughing)

391
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:11.253
Later. of course.

392
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:15.063
Control baby. fucking control.

393
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:19.530
You're right. you're right. you're right.

394
00:26:19.530 --> 00:26:21.430
We have some business to take care of.

395
00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:29.013
Pure beauty. ain't it?

396
00:26:32.370 --> 00:26:34.830
That's how I like it. only the best.

397
00:26:34.830 --> 00:26:38.177
It's kinda one of my modus operandims.

398
00:26:38.177 --> 00:26:40.759
(all laughing)

399
00:26:40.759 --> 00:26:44.833
♪ Praise him. praise him.

400
00:26:44.833 --> 00:26:48.416

(gentle upbeat music)

410
00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:24.240
Let me ask you something.

411
00:27:26.164 --> 00:27:30.753
Do you want that or do you want this?

412
00:27:31.695 --> 00:27:34.470
(dramatic music)

413
00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:35.553
I tell you what.

414
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:39.870
why don't you come with me.

415
00:27:42.076 --> 00:27:44.826
(dramatic music)

416
00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.233
Finally.

417
00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:22.410
Did you get it?

418
00:28:22.410 --> 00:28:23.664
Yes. son.

419
00:28:23.664 --> 00:28:25.620
It really itches.

420
00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:27.600
[Carl] I don't care if it's on fire.

421
00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:28.953
don't ever scratch it.

422
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:31.443
Don't scratch it.

423
00:28:32.707 --> 00:28:35.457
(dramatic music)

424
00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:43.570
It's gonna be okay.

425
00:28:45.190 --> 00:28:46.653
It'll never be okay.

426
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:50.926
You know what we have to do.

427
00:28:50.926 --> 00:28:51.759
No.

428
00:28:53.636 --> 00:28:55.356
Don't say that.

429
00:28:55.356 --> 00:28:58.106
(dramatic music)

430
00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:01.088

431
00:29:01.088 --> 00:29:03.838

432
00:29:13.232 --> 00:29:15.732
(both crying)

433
00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:19.263
The kids got it bad.

434
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.233
Guess they all do.

435
00:29:23.755 --> 00:29:25.679
(dramatic music)

436
00:29:25.679 --> 00:29:28.740
(insects chirping)

437
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.800
[Red] Hey. where's Bull and Jim?

438
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:35.717
(insects chirping)

439
00:29:37.650 --> 00:29:39.343
Why are we here?

440
00:29:39.343 --> 00:29:41.095
(insects chirping)

441
00:29:41.095 --> 00:29:42.887
Shit.

442
00:29:42.887 --> 00:29:45.887
(insects chirping)

443
00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.633
We gotta make things right.

444
00:29:52.512 --> 00:29:55.470
(insects chirping)

445
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:57.575
Put your mask back on.

446
00:29:57.575 --> 00:30:00.492
(insects chirping)

447
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.564
Hey.

448
00:30:18.564 --> 00:30:21.183
It's okay. you can look.

449
00:30:24.222 --> 00:30:27.570
(dramatic music)

450
00:30:27.570 --> 00:30:29.487
How do you like me now asshole?

451
00:30:29.487 --> 00:30:30.990
(Frenzy laughing)

452
00:30:30.990 --> 00:30:31.823
Enough.

453
00:30:32.670 --> 00:30:35.613
You need to get a handle on your bullshit.

454
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.450
Let me tell you something.

455
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:42.480
your days are numbered.

456
00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.773
You hear me bitch?

457
00:30:45.030 --> 00:30:46.713
Sit your ass down. Frenzy.

458
00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:49.623
Now.

459
00:30:51.089 --> 00:30:53.922
(Frenzy laughing)

460
00:31:05.910 --> 00:31:07.660
Looks like they're prime to kill.

461
00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:10.310
All they need is a little push.

462
00:31:15.391 --> 00:31:18.141
(dramatic music)

463
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:21.690
Hey man. it's gonna be okay.

464
00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:24.683
Get you some.

465
00:31:25.883 --> 00:31:28.633
(dramatic music)

466
00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:41.100
Hey.

467
00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:42.333
I'll take care of you.

468
00:31:45.330 --> 00:31:47.370
[Mac] Carl's good people.

469
00:31:47.370 --> 00:31:48.203
Is he?

470
00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.903
- If you saw some of the
shit that we've seen.

471
00:31:53.348 --> 00:31:57.098
- You have no idea the
things that I've seen.

472
00:31:59.070 --> 00:32:00.370
The things that I've done.

473
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:04.383
I guess there's monsters in all of us.

474
00:32:05.426 --> 00:32:08.176
(dramatic music)

475
00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:13.353
Now do you understand?

476
00:32:14.809 --> 00:32:17.559
(dramatic music)

477
00:32:42.252 --> 00:32:43.585
It'll be okay.

478
00:32:45.384 --> 00:32:46.953
He's just gonna wait us out.

479
00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:54.603
Seriously. where did you find her?

480
00:32:56.670 --> 00:32:57.633
Carl found her.

481
00:32:59.070 --> 00:33:02.293
Just like you found you.
just like he found me.

482
00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:05.823
Better or worse. she's family now.

483
00:33:06.708 --> 00:33:08.553
Yeah. I've heard the speech.

484
00:33:11.790 --> 00:33:13.383
This is Frenzy and Lo.

485
00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:17.130
It's been a while since our last score.

486
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.950
These gal have a deal for us.

487
00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:20.783
Oh yeah.

488
00:33:21.810 --> 00:33:22.643
What's that?

489
00:33:25.503 --> 00:33:28.378
A guy I know. he's been around.

490
00:33:28.378 --> 00:33:30.300
(insects chirping)

491
00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:32.643
I've bought from him
before. it's good shit.

492
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:36.453
He's a solid beast. it's that simple.

493
00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:40.263
It's never that simple.

494
00:33:41.910 --> 00:33:43.290
Yeah. we have to do something.

495
00:33:43.290 --> 00:33:45.843
I said no talking.

496
00:33:52.977 --> 00:33:54.810
My arms.

497
00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:55.643
I know.

498
00:33:56.768 --> 00:33:58.768
Here. it'll help some.

499
00:33:59.741 --> 00:34:02.491
(dramatic music)

500
00:34:11.370 --> 00:34:12.953
I'm gonna fix this.

501
00:34:13.957 --> 00:34:16.457
I'm gonna fix this. I promise.

502
00:34:20.173 --> 00:34:22.530
He doesn't look so good.

503
00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:24.330
Is there anything we can do to help?

504
00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:27.810
He needs his medicine.

505
00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:31.231
We don't have any.

506
00:34:31.231 --> 00:34:33.814
(will gasping)

507
00:34:35.229 --> 00:34:37.500
(insects chirping)

508
00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:38.880
[Delores] Don't touch me.

509
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.013
You know nothing about us. nothing.

510
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:43.770
I know that new dude you're with

511
00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:46.893
is in lockup for heroin
possession. for fuck sake.

512
00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:51.300
Is that the kind of you
want to expose our son to?

513
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:52.680
It isn't what you think.

514
00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.923
And it's nobody's goddamn
business. least of all yours.

515
00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:58.233
No get the fuck out.

516
00:34:59.128 --> 00:35:02.193
- What do you mean it's not
my business. he's my son.

517
00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.163
- You're my wife.
- Ex wife.

518
00:35:09.390 --> 00:35:12.180
- Honey. I'm just trying
to do the right thing here.

519
00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:15.060
Well. you're too late.

520
00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:17.463
You had your chance.

521
00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:20.043
No. we can work this out.

522
00:35:21.566 --> 00:35:24.003
You don't even know what this is.

523
00:35:25.650 --> 00:35:29.340
- [Hunter] How could you leave
me for that criminal fuck?

524
00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:30.173
Please go.

525
00:35:32.851 --> 00:35:36.330
For your own good. just go.

526
00:35:36.330 --> 00:35:37.780
[Hunter] He led us to this.

527
00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:40.170
He brought it all about us.

528
00:35:43.726 --> 00:35:46.350
- If we could just figure out
who the main outside wants.

529
00:35:46.350 --> 00:35:48.663
Y'all shut the fuck up over there.

530
00:35:52.590 --> 00:35:54.543
When's the last time he fixed?

531
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:57.393
Funny you should ask.

532
00:35:58.350 --> 00:36:00.400
I was wondering the same thing about you.

533
00:36:02.130 --> 00:36:04.140
[Frenzy] You got something on your mind.

534
00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:07.800
- All I'm saying is. you
and Lo are awfully steady.

535
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:09.363
I haven't seen a single shake.

536
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:15.693
Look. I'm asking nicely now for the kid.

537
00:36:16.650 --> 00:36:17.483
Are you holding?

538
00:36:19.290 --> 00:36:22.383
No asshole. I'm not holding.

539
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.373
If you have something you should share.

540
00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.790
- Look. if the kin doesn't
make it. who cares?

541
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:38.340
He's been nothing but dead weight anyway.

542
00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:41.184
We should probably just
put him out of his misery.

543
00:36:41.184 --> 00:36:42.282
Frenzy heartless cunt.

544
00:36:42.282 --> 00:36:43.800
Oh.

545
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.322
Nice chat asshole.

546
00:36:45.322 --> 00:36:49.091
You know you should just go and
suck your girlfriend's dick.

547
00:36:49.091 --> 00:36:52.650
(dramatic music)

548
00:36:52.650 --> 00:36:53.647
Oh. asshole.

549
00:36:53.647 --> 00:36:57.090
(Frenzy laughing)

550
00:36:57.090 --> 00:36:58.710
Whoopsie.

551
00:36:58.710 --> 00:37:01.020
Babe. he just tried to fucking kill me.

552
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:01.853
Come on.

553
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:05.471
(dramatic music)

554
00:37:05.471 --> 00:37:07.169
Fine.

555
00:37:07.169 --> 00:37:09.919
(dramatic music)

556
00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.837
(insects chirping)

557
00:37:24.341 --> 00:37:27.371
(dramatic music)

558
00:37:27.371 --> 00:37:30.204
(Frenzy laughing)

559
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:36.360
It's just like. you
know. always on my own.

560
00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:44.643
Then you come along and you just got me.

561
00:37:46.680 --> 00:37:48.763
You just have this power over me.

562
00:37:50.389 --> 00:37:53.407
(speaks in foreign language)

563
00:37:53.407 --> 00:37:55.324
Why would you say that?

564
00:37:58.365 --> 00:38:02.115
(speaks in foreign language)

565
00:38:13.557 --> 00:38:16.280
(gentle music)

566
00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:20.030
(speaks in foreign language)

567
00:38:44.598 --> 00:38:46.886
(gentle music)

568
00:38:46.886 --> 00:38:50.636
(speaks in foreign language)

569
00:39:18.621 --> 00:39:21.204
(gentle music)

570
00:39:23.643 --> 00:39:27.393
(speaks in foreign language)

571
00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:40.509
(gentle music)

572
00:39:54.150 --> 00:39:56.880
- [CeCe] Hey. look. I just
gotta go to the shitter.

573
00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.753
I'll take her.

574
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:12.600
You know your girlfriend?

575
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.893
Oh. she's real hot.

576
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:16.173
Shut up and pee.

577
00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:19.980
Look. don't get it twisted.

578
00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:22.983
I mean. you are not too shabby yourself.

579
00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:28.320
Watch it. girl.

580
00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.220
I mean. y'all do make a good couple.

581
00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:37.053
Look. I think y'all real cool.

582
00:40:38.820 --> 00:40:40.620
I just don't understand why y'all still

583
00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:43.470
listening to that old ass bitch.

584
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:45.430
She obviously don't like you

585
00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:48.663
and neither does her goofy ass muscle.

586
00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.650
You know what?

587
00:40:52.650 --> 00:40:55.533
Matter of fact. his gun is jammed. right?

588
00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:00.753
See. all you gotta do is get hers now.

589
00:41:02.196 --> 00:41:04.410
(dramatic music)

590
00:41:04.410 --> 00:41:07.270
You know us girl's got
us stick together. right.

591
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:09.670
Yeah. yeah. you're right. thank you.

592
00:41:13.022 --> 00:41:15.772
(dramatic music)

593
00:41:18.526 --> 00:41:21.443
(insects chirping)

594
00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:25.672
(dramatic music)

595
00:41:25.672 --> 00:41:28.743
- [Hunter Voiceover] I've
been hunting it so long now.

596
00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:36.693
Sometimes I think maybe never find it.

597
00:41:38.441 --> 00:41:42.358
(voices speaking indistinctly)

598
00:42:02.811 --> 00:42:05.225
(door knocking)

599
00:42:05.225 --> 00:42:08.640
I came that day to win you back.

600
00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.918
Hello.

601
00:42:09.918 --> 00:42:12.501
(gentle music)

602
00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:14.943
Delores?

603
00:42:17.150 --> 00:42:17.983
Baby?

604
00:42:21.483 --> 00:42:24.233
(dramatic music)

605
00:42:57.843 --> 00:42:59.311
Delores.

606
00:42:59.311 --> 00:43:02.061
(dramatic music)

607
00:43:10.788 --> 00:43:12.871
(crying)

608
00:43:20.664 --> 00:43:23.414
(dramatic music)

609
00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.243
[Carey] Red. are you sure?

610
00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.363
Mama and daddy wouldn't want this?

611
00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:36.603
Mama and daddy are dead.

612
00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:38.643
It killed them.

613
00:43:39.540 --> 00:43:42.450
And I aim to make that right.

614
00:43:42.450 --> 00:43:43.850
You got a problem with that?

615
00:43:45.389 --> 00:43:47.610
(insects chirping)

616
00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:48.873
It has to be done.

617
00:43:50.940 --> 00:43:52.623
We need to do something.

618
00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:55.467
What do you expect us to do?

619
00:43:55.467 --> 00:43:57.000
Are they gonna kill us?

620
00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.220
No. everything's gonna be okay.

621
00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.840
How do you know?

622
00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:04.083
Shiloh. as long as I'm around.

623
00:44:04.920 --> 00:44:07.570
nobody's gonna take you away
from me. you understand?

624
00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:10.833
I'd never let anybody do anything to you.

625
00:44:12.561 --> 00:44:15.144
(gentle music)

626
00:44:19.290 --> 00:44:22.394
- This stupid bitch was trying
a fiscal dollars her ass?

627
00:44:22.394 --> 00:44:23.794
I had to teach her a lesson.

628
00:44:25.590 --> 00:44:27.183
Oh. are you okay babe?

629
00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:29.453
What happened?

630
00:44:30.390 --> 00:44:31.950
Fuck it look like?

631
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:33.030
She kicked my ass.

632
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:35.070
- You know. you people
really don't understand

633
00:44:35.070 --> 00:44:36.820
what shut your mouth means. do you?

634
00:44:38.200 --> 00:44:41.393
Look. we're not gonna hurt you. okay.

635
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.120
Our fight is out there.

636
00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:47.790
And unfortunately it's your fight now too.

637
00:44:47.790 --> 00:44:49.320
Not my fight.

638
00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.600
- What do you think they're
gonna do if they get in

639
00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:52.833
or you get out there?

640
00:44:53.940 --> 00:44:55.380
Kill you.

641
00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:57.730
- You think they're just
gonna leave witnesses?

642
00:44:58.830 --> 00:45:01.293
Listen. we're just thinking here.

643
00:45:02.190 --> 00:45:05.730
You want outta here. we want outta here.

644
00:45:05.730 --> 00:45:09.270
Why don't we work together.
huh. to help each other?

645
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:11.430
(Gail laughing)

646
00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:13.173
How are you gonna help us?

647
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:15.900
Well. I don't know.

648
00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.930
But there's safety in numbers. right?

649
00:45:18.930 --> 00:45:21.000
I mean. maybe we make weapons. right.

650
00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.480
like Molotov cocktails from the bottles.

651
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.820
That's not a bad idea.

652
00:45:26.820 --> 00:45:28.440
The moment you open up that door.

653
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:32.160
if we even manage to get it
open. they'll shoot you dead.

654
00:45:32.160 --> 00:45:35.700
Well. cocktails. do still sound good.

655
00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:38.223
Bartender. shots all around.

656
00:45:39.515 --> 00:45:42.265
(dramatic music)

657
00:45:46.260 --> 00:45:48.570
Boys and girls.

658
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:51.030
how's it going in there?

659
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:54.090
Now the clock. she is a ticking.

660
00:45:54.090 --> 00:45:59.090
All you gotta do is walk
away and leave it with us.

661
00:46:00.923 --> 00:46:02.640
(insects chirping)

662
00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.473
Anytime.

663
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:07.713
It's gotta be hungry by now.

664
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:12.828
No. no. no. no. no.

665
00:46:12.828 --> 00:46:14.330
(gentle music)

666
00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:16.830
(Carl crying)

667
00:46:38.610 --> 00:46:40.113
It was all fine.

668
00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:42.363
It was fine.

669
00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:45.393
I had it all under control.

670
00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:50.070
If you hadn't got me thrown in prison.

671
00:46:50.070 --> 00:46:51.633
So this is my fault.

672
00:46:53.260 --> 00:46:55.860
No.

673
00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.854
This is all your fault.

674
00:46:57.854 --> 00:46:59.790
(dramatic music)

675
00:46:59.790 --> 00:47:00.903
That's not true.

676
00:47:01.890 --> 00:47:03.813
My wife is dead.

677
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:06.243
She's dead.

678
00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:09.243
I loved her too.

679
00:47:10.611 --> 00:47:13.194
(gentle music)

680
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:18.600
Where's the boy?

681
00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:24.253
Where is he?

682
00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:27.123
He's safe.

683
00:47:30.446 --> 00:47:33.360
- I'm gonna put down
the animal who did this?

684
00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:34.923
That won't bring her back.

685
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:37.413
She wouldn't want that.

686
00:47:37.413 --> 00:47:41.253
Well we can't ask her now. can we?

687
00:47:43.890 --> 00:47:45.603
Just get the fuck out.

688
00:47:47.820 --> 00:47:49.570
I'm gonna grieve now.

689
00:47:52.020 --> 00:47:53.433
But know this.

690
00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:55.833
when this ends.

691
00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:01.743
I'm gonna fix this.

692
00:48:08.671 --> 00:48:11.254
(gentle music)

693
00:48:27.631 --> 00:48:30.548
(insects chirping)

694
00:48:37.470 --> 00:48:39.480
[Travis] What do we do?

695
00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.853
So I think I got an idea.

696
00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.600
The last one got you clocked.

697
00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.523
And if at first you don't succeed.

698
00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:56.493
Hey relax.

699
00:48:57.510 --> 00:49:00.793
It's just something to take
the edge off. to help the boy.

700
00:49:00.793 --> 00:49:03.135
What is it?

701
00:49:03.135 --> 00:49:04.635
It's Xany. okay.

702
00:49:06.394 --> 00:49:09.144
(dramatic music)

703
00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.074
Thank you.

704
00:49:13.074 --> 00:49:13.907
Yeah.

705
00:49:15.470 --> 00:49:18.543
Look. I know this is gonna
sound awkward. right.

706
00:49:19.530 --> 00:49:24.230
but the crazy ass bitch behind
you. and her girlfriend.

707
00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:26.520
they said they're gonna kill you.

708
00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:28.070
She told me this in a bathroom.

709
00:49:30.150 --> 00:49:31.281
And then they're gonna make a run for it.

710
00:49:31.281 --> 00:49:34.503
- Hey. what the fuck
is going on over there?

711
00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:38.430
None of your business. Benedict Arnold.

712
00:49:38.430 --> 00:49:40.050
What did you call me?

713
00:49:40.050 --> 00:49:41.310
What does that evil mean?

714
00:49:41.310 --> 00:49:42.390
Jesus.

715
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:44.763
Gail. don't let her play you?

716
00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:49.373
Is that it?

717
00:49:50.547 --> 00:49:52.743
Are you playing me. girl?

718
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:58.907
- Look. I don't have any
skin in this game. right.

719
00:49:59.790 --> 00:50:02.820
But if they pull something
that's gonna affect all of us.

720
00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:05.040
[Mac] I knew that crazy was rotten.

721
00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:09.333
- You lying. game playing.
manipulative little.

722
00:50:10.398 --> 00:50:11.793
(dramatic music)

723
00:50:11.793 --> 00:50:15.780
What have you done?

724
00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:18.930
- [Frenzy] I don't know
what this said to you.

725
00:50:18.930 --> 00:50:20.880
but whatever it is. it's a lie.

726
00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.503
[Mac] Frenzy fuck us.

727
00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:29.163
- Look me in the eye
and tell me the truth.

728
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:32.733
You want truth?

729
00:50:38.100 --> 00:50:38.933
Nice car.

730
00:50:41.070 --> 00:50:42.070
All right. throw me.

731
00:50:43.860 --> 00:50:45.210
[Hunter] You sure?

732
00:50:45.210 --> 00:50:46.510
Don't fuck with me. man.

733
00:50:53.466 --> 00:50:56.216
(birds chirping)

734
00:51:00.063 --> 00:51:02.713
- [Hunter] I've been looking
for you for a long time.

735
00:51:07.650 --> 00:51:08.643
Who did this?

736
00:51:11.625 --> 00:51:13.325
Those are the people who did it.

737
00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:18.730
That's the money Simone paid
them for offing your brother

738
00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:26.193
just before they stormed the
apartment and killed everyone.

739
00:51:28.788 --> 00:51:31.371
(gentle music)

740
00:51:32.970 --> 00:51:34.890
Why should I believe you?

741
00:51:34.890 --> 00:51:38.673
- They killed your brother.
that much is certain.

742
00:51:40.620 --> 00:51:45.513
What's uncertain is what are
you going to do about it?

743
00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:53.110
What's in it for you?

744
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:55.590
(birds chirping)

745
00:51:55.590 --> 00:51:57.130
They killed my wife

746

747
00:52:03.990 --> 00:52:05.133

How?

751
00:52:17.250 --> 00:52:21.600
- Just bring them to me
and I'll do the rest.

752
00:52:21.600 --> 00:52:23.640
- [Gail] We didn't even
know you had a brother.

753
00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:26.010
Oh. please. Gail. I've seen the photos.

754

760
00:52:44.280 --> 00:52:46.470

shells left in a gun.

764
00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:53.160
you little snake.

765
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.260
[Carl] I like your odds.

766
00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:57.330
Well that means two of you are dead.

767
00:52:57.330 --> 00:53:01.560
And then there's four
against two. in our favor.

768
00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:03.843
So how do you like those odds. bitch?

Time's up.

771
00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:11.363
Wait.

772
00:53:11.363 --> 00:53:12.350
(insects chirping)

773
00:53:12.350 --> 00:53:13.650
[Gail] Do what she says.

774
00:53:15.030 --> 00:53:17.493
You think she can actually do it?

775
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:19.890
Fuck round and find out.

776
00:53:19.890 --> 00:53:21.918
- [Travis] CeCe. come on man.
what the fuck are you doing.

777
00:53:21.918 --> 00:53:24.251
Shut up you piece of shit.

778
00:53:27.883 --> 00:53:29.793
Get behind the fucking bar.

779
00:53:32.970 --> 00:53:35.613
Oh. your creepy ass
girlfriend is gonna miss you.

781
00:53:44.977 --> 00:53:45.810

(dramatic music)

784
00:54:05.411 --> 00:54:06.244
Stop.

785
00:54:10.005 --> 00:54:10.922
It's her.

786
00:54:11.972 --> 00:54:14.555
(gentle music)

787
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:28.830
Give it up. Mackey boy.

788
00:54:28.830 --> 00:54:29.663
Stay back.

789
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:36.093
- I'm gonna make you pay
for what you've done.

790
00:54:37.170 --> 00:54:38.913
Simone killed your brother.

791
00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.658
Nice try.

792
00:54:45.658 --> 00:54:48.408

[Hunter] Come on boy. he's coming.

795
00:55:12.158 --> 00:55:14.292
[Red] He better hurry up.

796
00:55:14.292 --> 00:55:17.010
(dramatic music)

797
00:55:17.010 --> 00:55:18.243
Something isn't right.

798
00:55:19.399 --> 00:55:21.510
We just need to burn this place down now.

799
00:55:21.510 --> 00:55:23.520
get the fuck out of here.

800
00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.143
This is how it's got to be.

801
00:55:25.980 --> 00:55:30.180
I mean. we don't even know
if fire's gonna kill it.

802
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:31.653
Not before it feeds.

803
00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:36.333
Besides. you gotta answer to him.

804
00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:41.100
Now. we're couldn't find it without him.

805
00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:42.500
We're gonna play it his way.

806
00:55:45.024 --> 00:55:45.857
(moaning)

807
00:55:45.857 --> 00:55:47.736

It's happening.

821
00:56:34.793 --> 00:56:37.500
If you have a bullet
left. put it in my head.

822
00:56:38.845 --> 00:56:40.304
I can't do that.

823
00:56:40.304 --> 00:56:41.387
No. please.

824
00:56:44.193 --> 00:56:45.026

Do you think I'm a monster?

844
00:57:56.430 --> 00:57:58.923
This is the price.

845
00:58:02.460 --> 00:58:03.873
He was attacked.

846
00:58:05.310 --> 00:58:09.483
Without this and he becomes what hurt him.

847
00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:12.693
What killed so many others.

848
00:58:15.660 --> 00:58:16.623
This poison.

You go with them.

869
