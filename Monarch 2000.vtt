00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.557
(ominous music)

6
00:05:02.628 --> 00:05:04.564
- Should we light a fire?

7
00:05:04.564 --> 00:05:06.127
Housekeeper!

8
00:05:06.127 --> 00:05:07.544
Somebody help us!

9
00:05:14.358 --> 00:05:16.025
- Boy where are you?

10
00:05:18.198 --> 00:05:20.448
Get yourself down here boy.

11
00:05:22.278 --> 00:05:25.611
No. no fires we can't attract attention.

12
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.933
Boy we need your help.

13
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:26.550
- [George] Big enough even for him.

14
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:27.843
- Watch your mouth.

15
00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.340
Our circumstances may
be unique but that does

16
00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.163
not give you free license for disrespect.

17
00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:38.900
- You sound ready for office.

18
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.733
- I'm only ready to serve.

19
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:46.850
- I'm sure you are ready to
serve. your own interests.

20
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.973
- Well this is ideal.

21
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.723
I'll get the others.

22
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.510
- Finer men than you have
died at my feet. for less.

23
00:07:05.216 --> 00:07:07.799
(somber music)

24
00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.950
- [George] He's even heavier
now than outside. in the rain.

25
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:32.400
- [Duncan] You complain like a woman.

26
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:34.200
Just hold your end and stop chattering.

27
00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.793
- [Malcolm] We're nearly there.

28
00:08:38.375 --> 00:08:39.360
- [George] You're more familiar

29
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.680
with the complaints of women.

30
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:43.400
Be careful. don't drop your end.

31
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:44.233
- He'll hear us.

32
00:08:44.233 --> 00:08:45.953
Just keep moving.

33
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:28.203
I'll need bandages. water. and light.

34
00:09:29.070 --> 00:09:31.143
Get some candles from downstairs.

35
00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:35.600
- And check the kitchens for food.

36
00:09:44.921 --> 00:09:47.203
- Food. at a time like this?

37
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.160
- Weak stomach.

38
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.123
- Must be the company I keep.

39
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:55.133
- You two can look for the boy.

40
00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.143
He'll have a better grasp of
the geography of the house.

41
00:10:26.021 --> 00:10:28.010
- This situation makes me uneasy.

42
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:30.783
There's more at stake
here than reputation.

43
00:10:32.410 --> 00:10:37.040
The coincidence of circumstance
may give rise to suspicion.

44
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.590
- There is nothing more to
this than meets the eye.

45
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:42.870
- Attacked on the open road.

46
00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.060
Not a soul in sight.

47
00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.670
- The perfect conditions
for crime. surely.

48
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:50.150
- For the perfect crime. perhaps.

49
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.190
- [George] Let's get to the larders

50
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:53.840
and we can discuss your
theories over a light supper.

51
00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.650
- Something is not right here.

52
00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:01.650
This house for one thing.
empty. but for one servant boy.

53
00:11:04.041 --> 00:11:05.673
- I'm not denying our situation.

54
00:11:07.481 --> 00:11:09.410
but your worrying would find

55
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:11.820
suspicion even in the wall carvings.

56
00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.290
We were attacked and we are
sheltering. licking our wounds.

57
00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:16.730
as simple as that.

58
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:18.230
- Only one of us wounded.

59
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.330
The most protected of us.

60
00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.793
That in itself raises my suspicions.

61
00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:27.273
But the motive. no money taken.

62
00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:30.320
- Nothing taken and no harm done.

63
00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.403
- Not yet.

64
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:40.440
- [Guard] Smells musty.

65
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.620
- [Guard] The books probably.

66
00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:43.050
- [Guard] Strange.

67
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:44.633
A library with no books.

68
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.558
- Get off me you mad fool.

69
00:12:23.558 --> 00:12:25.730
Are you trying to finish me off?

70
00:12:25.730 --> 00:12:28.240
- Your wound needs cleaning your Majesty.

71
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.140
- If it needs cleaning. then clean it.

72
00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:33.210
By Christ if you continue
to tease my wound

73
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.650
I'll inflict a mightier one on you.

74
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:36.957
Get me some wine.

75
00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.300
- The others will be back. shortly.

76
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:41.390
I don't want to leave
you in this condition.

77
00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.920
- If you all showed the same concern

78
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.193
at the time I wouldn't be run through.

79
00:12:50.301 --> 00:12:52.201
You look in remarkably good condition.

80
00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.270
Any fatalities?

81
00:12:56.270 --> 00:12:57.720
- No. your Majesty.

82
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:01.350
- Any other injuries?

83
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.300
- No. your Majesty.

84
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.973
- So I managed to save
everyone by taking the fall.

85
00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.290
- It all happened so quickly that.

86
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:15.733
- You only had time to protect
your own skinny behinds.

87
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:19.780
And our aggressor?

88
00:13:21.336 --> 00:13:22.169
- He fled.

89
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:26.450
- Not before you all begged liked dogs

90
00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.223
for your lives no doubt.

91
00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.320
Get me the bloody wine. now.

92
00:13:36.994 --> 00:13:39.660
- [George] You'll take an hourly rotation

93
00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:44.660
to guard the roof. the
front. and the King's room.

94
00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:49.560
- [Duncan] You must keep
vigilant for the boy.

95
00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.950
He's of more benefit alive.

96
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:53.680
particularly if he knows something.

97
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:55.990
- He is only a boy and
may well be innocent.

98
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:57.823
No bullish behavior.

99
00:14:17.058 --> 00:14:19.225
(thunder)

100
00:14:50.777 --> 00:14:53.110
They're a bit hard. want one?

101
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:54.593
- His Majesty is awake.

102
00:14:55.830 --> 00:14:59.010
- Ah. yes we thought
we heard another roar.

103
00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.510
- And he's looking for wine.

104
00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:01.343
- I'll go.

105
00:15:02.252 --> 00:15:04.280
- He'll be looking for
answers before long.

106
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.883
Will you oblige there as well?

107
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:09.300
- What does he remember?

108
00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:10.595
- Everything. it seems.

109
00:15:10.595 --> 00:15:13.840
though he's not too happy
about us being unscathed.

110
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:15.070
- And the wound.

111
00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:15.973
- I've cleaned it.

112
00:15:17.155 --> 00:15:18.900
But the legs are badly ulcerated.

113
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.690
But they're not any more
infected than they were before.

114
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:22.831
There's considerable discomfort.

115
00:15:22.831 --> 00:15:26.360
- [Henry] Where's my wine.

116
00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:28.633
- His maturity of years
haven't mellowed him.

117
00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:32.493
- Perhaps we should all
go back in together.

118
00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:37.366
Where are the guards?

119
00:15:37.366 --> 00:15:39.070
- On the roof. and the front door.

120
00:15:39.070 --> 00:15:42.293
and one was supposed to
be on duty by this door.

121
00:16:02.735 --> 00:16:06.068
- A sound and I'll snap you like a twig.

122
00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.023
- Too sweet.

123
00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:15.387
- Now I've heard you use many
superlatives on his Majesty.

124
00:16:15.387 --> 00:16:17.810
but that is a first.

125
00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:19.043
- The wine you fool.

126
00:16:20.150 --> 00:16:22.410
- So you've got wine for us.

127
00:16:22.410 --> 00:16:25.770
- Only this half. he drank the rest.

128
00:16:25.770 --> 00:16:28.400
- Always was a bit of
selected wine critic.

129
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:31.090
- What's going on. when will he see us?

130
00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:33.123
- In a hurry to be chastised?

131
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:36.670
- He'll see you now.

132
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.674
- Age before intelligence and beauty.

133
00:16:39.674 --> 00:16:40.507
- Humf.

134
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:46.310
His anger I can cope with.
but this shutting us out.

135
00:16:46.310 --> 00:16:49.730
is unlike him and it unnerves me.

136
00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.400
- You like your monarch's
to be predictable.

137
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.520
- I like to think of him as reliable.

138
00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:58.360
It is out of character of
him to behave in this way.

139
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.703
- It's not everyday you survive
an assassination attempt.

140
00:17:04.933 --> 00:17:08.540
- I don't think you ought to
feed the king's suspicion.

141
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.633
- Why. what's his theory?

142
00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:13.594
- I'm not sure that he has one.

143
00:17:13.594 --> 00:17:15.783
but he never was too
welcoming of questions.

144
00:17:15.783 --> 00:17:18.023
even in his more receptive moods.

145
00:17:18.895 --> 00:17:22.117
- [Henry] Where's my wine?

146
00:17:22.117 --> 00:17:23.230
- [Malcolm] Go straight through.

147
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:26.000
- But perhaps I should wait for the wine.

148
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
When he is more mellow. he is more.

149
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.490
- Forgiving?

150
00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:31.170
- Sure minded.

151
00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:32.620
- [Malcolm] He wants you now.

152
00:18:02.930 --> 00:18:04.560
- When I speak you reply only with

153
00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.450
a nod or a shake of your head.

154
00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:07.543
Do you understand?

155
00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:10.860
Are you alone here?

156
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.410
Don't play games with me.

157
00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:15.870
You're gambling with your life.

158
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:19.114
I'll ask you again. are you alone here.

159
00:18:19.114 --> 00:18:21.693
are there any other members
of this household here?

160
00:18:23.690 --> 00:18:25.760
You're getting the hang of this.

161
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.433
If I am to release my grip.
you won't run or shout?

162
00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.993
You will run and shout?

163
00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:33.213
That's better.

164
00:18:41.535 --> 00:18:43.035
What about a game?

165
00:18:44.830 --> 00:18:46.630
I could have killed you if I wanted.

166
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.743
Oh come on a game will
civilize the situation.

167
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.673
I'm Thorn.

168
00:18:57.330 --> 00:18:58.633
- William. Will.

169
00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.403
- There's a lot more going on here. Will.

170
00:19:02.403 --> 00:19:04.810
than you probably realize.

171
00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:06.020
- Who are you?

172
00:19:06.020 --> 00:19:07.330
- That's not important.

173
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.270
What's going on here is.

174
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.740
There is a situation unfolding this

175
00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:13.380
night which may break this country.

176
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.153
- I'm only the groundkeeper's son.

177
00:19:15.153 --> 00:19:17.273
I don't own or even run this house.

178
00:19:17.273 --> 00:19:19.790
- That much I've gathered for myself.

179
00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.880
But there is a matter of great
importance unfolding here.

180
00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:24.010
A matter of state.

181
00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.640
- I can't help you with
matters of politics.

182
00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.370
I have more urgent concerns.

183
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:29.680
- Like your guests.

184
00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:32.113
- They were not invited by me or anyone.

185
00:19:32.113 --> 00:19:34.360
they are not guests of this house.

186
00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.820
- Nor am I for that matter.

187
00:19:35.820 --> 00:19:38.090
- I am trusted with the
safe keeping of this house

188
00:19:38.090 --> 00:19:41.390
and don't intend to lose my
position within this household.

189
00:19:41.390 --> 00:19:43.850
- There are other positions
in other households.

190
00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.470
- I've been here since I was born.

191
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:46.780
- So you know the house well?

192
00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:47.760
- Well enough to know that there

193
00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.133
is nothing of value here.
no hidden treasures.

194
00:19:51.365 --> 00:19:52.430
His Lordship is away until spring

195
00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.370
and what little supplies there
are will only sustain me.

196
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:56.640
- You think I'm a thief?

197
00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.380
Come to rob this house of all its riches?

198
00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.642
But you may be surprised to
learn that there is something.

199
00:20:01.642 --> 00:20:04.513
or should I say. someone. of value here.

200
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:06.730
What do you know of your guests?

201
00:20:06.730 --> 00:20:09.750
- You still haven't told me who you are.

202
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.600
- You better sit.

203
00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.840
You say you're not a politician

204
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.723
but you must have a view. an opinion.

205
00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.120
Is this you?

206
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.220
- I don't understand.

207
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.573
- Oh I think you do.

208
00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.927
Intimate place you have here. very cold.

209
00:20:30.421 --> 00:20:32.000
They don't make you live here surely?

210
00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.530
To wind the clock.

211
00:20:33.530 --> 00:20:35.670
- I have quarters in the house.

212
00:20:35.670 --> 00:20:38.730
My duties are whatever his
Lord and Ladyship require.

213
00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:39.620
I tend the gardens.

214
00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.250
See to repairs.

215
00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:44.563
- But no room for your chess.
your writings or your diary?

216
00:20:45.630 --> 00:20:46.780
In your quarters below.

217
00:20:47.743 --> 00:20:49.080
I'm not that concerned with

218
00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:52.002
the mood swings of youth
and household gossip.

219
00:20:52.002 --> 00:20:54.300
But you are more complex an individual

220
00:20:54.300 --> 00:20:55.600
than you will admit to me.

221
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:02.683
This is you on the outside.

222
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:08.383
but inside you have aspirations.

223
00:21:09.242 --> 00:21:11.043
they could cost you dear.

224
00:21:12.490 --> 00:21:15.793
A boy with fire in his
belly. I'm right aren't I?

225
00:21:17.270 --> 00:21:18.893
What do you know of the new arrivals?

226
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:22.660
- They broke through the door.

227
00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:24.130
- Not thieves. then if they're still here.

228
00:21:24.130 --> 00:21:26.310
Unless they're blind or very stupid.

229
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:27.570
- With the commotion of the storm

230
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:29.870
I thought they were here to rob the house.

231
00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.030
They have two hounds.

232
00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:32.400
- How many in total?

233
00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.233
- Hounds?

234
00:21:33.233 --> 00:21:34.480
Two.

235
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.313
- No. men.

236
00:21:35.313 --> 00:21:37.860
- Six I think. but they
were carrying another.

237
00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.620
- A large ox-like man.

238
00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:40.453
- Yes.

239
00:21:40.453 --> 00:21:41.440
Did you see him?

240
00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.273
- I know of him.

241
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:45.840
So if they're not here to rob.

242
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.670
what conclusions have you drawn?

243
00:21:47.670 --> 00:21:48.503
- None.

244
00:21:48.503 --> 00:21:50.090
- Oh come on Will. you have the movements

245
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:51.530
and manner of someone with a plan.

246
00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:52.710
- They're just a injured party who

247
00:21:52.710 --> 00:21:53.890
want shelter from the elements.

248
00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:55.100
- Well then why hide on the roof?

249
00:21:55.100 --> 00:21:57.603
You know that something isn't right.

250
00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.590
- What's your theory?

251
00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:02.100
- I have no theory. just facts.

252
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:04.153
Your guest is a man of some stature.

253
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.270
- That is obvious.

254
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:09.023
- I am deadly serious.

255
00:22:15.578 --> 00:22:18.670
It is the human line of
defense which makes a monarchy.

256
00:22:18.670 --> 00:22:20.255
Without the people there is no reason

257
00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:21.903
and therefore no monarchy.

258
00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.780
- What are you saying?

259
00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:29.263
- You have a brain. use it.

260
00:22:38.538 --> 00:22:40.705
- Wait. there's questions.

261
00:22:49.393 --> 00:22:52.060
(ominous music)

262
00:23:23.785 --> 00:23:24.618
- Aaargh.

263
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.927
I'm surrounded by incompetence.

264
00:23:48.788 --> 00:23:49.621
Aargh.

265
00:23:52.505 --> 00:23:54.620
- Sire. your wound needs attention.

266
00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.320
- From a physician. not a butcher.

267
00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.173
- An infection may spread.

268
00:24:00.068 --> 00:24:02.430
- When I look around at your faces.

269
00:24:02.430 --> 00:24:06.060
it's clear to see where
an infection might lie.

270
00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.747
You all hang on to me and my
court like simpering dogs.

271
00:24:09.747 --> 00:24:13.743
only without the loyalty
one can expect from a hound.

272
00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:19.253
There is a rot that has gone
unattended for too long.

273
00:24:21.668 --> 00:24:22.618
It may be too late.

274
00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:26.570
- I've cleaned it as best I can.

275
00:24:27.609 --> 00:24:30.487
but there should be no
lasting affect. only a scar.

276
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:37.773
- The mark of a warrior.

277
00:24:44.030 --> 00:24:49.030
This grand. empty house.
is like a barren woman.

278
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:52.260
There is much on offer.

279
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:57.310
An exterior of promise. of
beauty of grace and strength.

280
00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:00.413
but inside an empty vessel.

281
00:25:14.468 --> 00:25:17.030
- We'll be out of here by morning. sire.

282
00:25:17.030 --> 00:25:19.130
- That should be a relief to you at least.

283
00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:23.690
This situation is showing
me your true worth.

284
00:25:23.690 --> 00:25:26.940
For all your mighty
talk and advice of war.

285
00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:30.753
you are all weak. feeble creatures.

286
00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:36.530
Or is there more to this
situation than you have told me?

287
00:25:36.530 --> 00:25:38.790
- The injury is causing you distress.

288
00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:43.300
- Don't think this
situation makes me deluded.

289
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:46.060
or gives you license
for treasonous remarks.

290
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:51.884
My eyes are opening.

291
00:25:51.884 --> 00:25:54.626
but all I can see is this old ragged body

292
00:25:54.626 --> 00:25:57.203
which is more bulk than stature.

293
00:25:58.087 --> 00:25:59.747
But what would you know.

294
00:25:59.747 --> 00:26:04.273
you've no taste of life.
or death. no wars fought.

295
00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:14.060
But then. perhaps wars are
not the way forward anyway.

296
00:26:16.330 --> 00:26:19.760
- But war is an inevitability.

297
00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:21.720
- My father never thought much of war

298
00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.600
except as a device for raising taxes.

299
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.628
As a well run and peaceful country

300
00:26:27.628 --> 00:26:29.970
your people frown at taxes.

301
00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.140
but cheer us in to war and with smiles

302
00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:34.693
on their faces pay their taxes.

303
00:26:35.788 --> 00:26:38.538
- Matters of state can surely
wait until your recovery.

304
00:26:39.603 --> 00:26:42.703
- And what if that recovery doesn't come?

305
00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:45.760
Will my country be orphaned?

306
00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:48.950
Will any of you even care?

307
00:26:48.950 --> 00:26:50.100
- Sire?

308
00:26:50.100 --> 00:26:51.240
- I'm tired.

309
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:52.243
Leave me.

310
00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:55.440
I'm sure I've given you enough topic

311
00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.790
for conversation to see
you through to morning.

312
00:27:06.270 --> 00:27:07.673
Leave the dumb animal.

313
00:27:09.236 --> 00:27:13.023
One of the few I can trust
around here. aren't you?

314
00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.830
Well what are you two waiting for?

315
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.370
Some of the same?

316
00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:22.650
Get out and get me the bloody wine.

317
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:24.130
- Yes sire.

318
00:27:24.130 --> 00:27:26.020
- Will you require anything else. sire?

319
00:27:26.020 --> 00:27:30.303
- If I do you'll know where to
find me just follow the roar.

320
00:27:36.090 --> 00:27:37.323
Keep me informed.

321
00:27:54.388 --> 00:27:55.925
- [Duncan] You found him then.

322
00:27:55.925 --> 00:27:56.925
- What does he know?

323
00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:00.623
- Only to watch things more closely.

324
00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:02.690
How is he?

325
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:04.343
Is it time for me?

326
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.330
- There's no permanent damage.

327
00:28:07.330 --> 00:28:10.520
but he's not too happy
about the situation.

328
00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.913
- Does he want to see me?

329
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.401
- Well I don't think.

330
00:28:14.401 --> 00:28:16.300
- I don't think you want
to keep him waiting.

331
00:28:52.581 --> 00:28:55.248
(ominous music)

332
00:29:32.965 --> 00:29:34.215
- Your Majesty.

333
00:29:37.579 --> 00:29:38.746
- Who's there?

334
00:29:40.184 --> 00:29:42.017
Is that you Catherine.

335
00:30:01.243 --> 00:30:03.993
What's going on. is the house ablaze?

336
00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.163
Or are you trying to push me
into my grave ahead of time?

337
00:30:12.944 --> 00:30:15.290
Will I have to fight you for an answer?

338
00:30:16.970 --> 00:30:18.643
- I'm sorry your Majesty.

339
00:30:19.670 --> 00:30:21.513
I thought that you wanted to see me.

340
00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:23.213
- Whatever for?

341
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.080
I expressly decided to be left to myself.

342
00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:28.960
Or are you another one who thinks

343
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.670
he can over rule the king of England?

344
00:30:31.670 --> 00:30:33.230
- No. I. I.

345
00:30:33.230 --> 00:30:37.003
- Have you come to give me your
version of tonight's events.

346
00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:39.953
- Sire?

347
00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:44.400
- Don't you think it slightly curious

348
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.240
that of three courtiers
and three of my guards.

349
00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.310
on a journey known to only four of us

350
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:53.803
we should be attacked
and only I am injured.

351
00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.590
- Coincidence?

352
00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.447
- I should bloody well
hope it wasn't by design.

353
00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.270
- I did warn of leaving the palace

354
00:31:04.270 --> 00:31:07.200
under the current circumstances.

355
00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:11.463
- These current circumstances you refer

356
00:31:11.463 --> 00:31:16.453
to are supposed to make me a
prisoner in my own country?

357
00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:20.430
- There is opinion in the land

358
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:22.900
of which your Majesty is aware.

359
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:23.800
- From a minority.

360
00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.730
- A minority. yes.

361
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:30.290
But enemies.

362
00:31:30.290 --> 00:31:33.040
- Enemies are commonplace for a king.

363
00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.186
Whole nations can have a
fire of hate in their bellies

364
00:31:36.186 --> 00:31:39.480
does that mean I shouldn't venture out

365
00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.740
amongst my people. in my country?

366
00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:45.989
I also remember. it was
your advice to go forth

367
00:31:45.989 --> 00:31:49.663
amongst my people to
forge a greater respect.

368
00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:59.740
- I'm here. we all are to
serve you and protect you from.

369
00:32:01.749 --> 00:32:04.991
- And what a fine example of
your station you provide here

370
00:32:04.991 --> 00:32:09.360
a fitting example of what
not to have in a courtier.

371
00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:15.340
Get out and don't come
back until you can find

372
00:32:16.550 --> 00:32:19.530
an adequate explanation
for this catastrophe.

373
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:21.905
because until you do I hold you all

374
00:32:21.905 --> 00:32:24.370
guilty for the attempt on my life.

375
00:32:26.907 --> 00:32:30.683
And if that's too much for
you to take responsibility for

376
00:32:30.683 --> 00:32:34.390
don't come back until
you fill that with wine.

377
00:32:39.046 --> 00:32:41.713
(ominous music)

378
00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:39.080
You don't answer me back. do you?

379
00:33:43.051 --> 00:33:48.017
Although I dare say you
would given half a chance.

380
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:56.950
Perhaps I'll come back as a
dog. Rome would like that.

381
00:34:00.069 --> 00:34:02.219
Or perhaps I'm living
out my punishment now

382
00:34:03.947 --> 00:34:06.563
and the ultimate existence is as a dog.

383
00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:40.203
- Secrets?

384
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:46.023
- Glad to see you. was he?

385
00:34:47.810 --> 00:34:51.117
- In just the right mood
for visitors was he?

386
00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:57.270
- Enjoy your apples?

387
00:34:57.270 --> 00:35:00.920
- I don't believe I've seen
you break into a sweat before.

388
00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.320
- [Malcolm] Not without the
presence of a whore at least.

389
00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.123
- Brave words. he may attack.

390
00:35:06.050 --> 00:35:07.790
What. no witty retort?

391
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:09.223
- No biting sarcasm?

392
00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.863
- I think that his majes.

393
00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:35.750
- Who are you accusing?

394
00:35:35.750 --> 00:35:39.240
- What are you saying. that
we are plotting. contriving?

395
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.720
- There is more going
on here than we realize.

396
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.509
- You mean the boy?

397
00:35:44.509 --> 00:35:49.509
- But he's only a servant boy.
how could he even understand?

398
00:35:49.850 --> 00:35:51.620
- Have you questioned him?

399
00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:52.993
- About what?

400
00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.370
If we reveal too much then we
will do more harm than good.

401
00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:00.620
- He has no idea that it is

402
00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:04.660
the king of England who
lies injured upstairs?

403
00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:05.493
- No.

404
00:36:06.384 --> 00:36:10.010
- He would be acting
differently if he knew.

405
00:36:10.010 --> 00:36:11.960
- How can you say that?

406
00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.986
You don't know him.

407
00:36:13.986 --> 00:36:17.927
Up in the tower I found a diary.

408
00:36:17.927 --> 00:36:21.360
some writing and a chess board.

409
00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.593
- Oooh. then we need go no further.

410
00:36:24.765 --> 00:36:26.220
A sure sign of weak character

411
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:27.880
and a traitor in the making.

412
00:36:27.880 --> 00:36:31.477
We should have all chess sets
burned on order of the king.

413
00:36:31.477 --> 00:36:34.523
- The boy is presenting
us with a shallow image.

414
00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:40.163
Almost too simplistic.

415
00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:52.993
- I'm going for a look around.
at least try and stay awake.

416
00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:11.900
- We should present him with the full

417
00:37:11.900 --> 00:37:14.220
facts to see what he knows.

418
00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:15.850
By morning we will be gone.

419
00:37:15.850 --> 00:37:18.570
the situation will be a bad dream for us

420
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.691
and an elaborate unsubstantiated tale

421
00:37:21.691 --> 00:37:24.253
for the servant boy to explain away.

422
00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:28.673
- But what if he is believed
and we are mentioned.

423
00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:33.660
- I have not mentioned my name to him.

424
00:37:33.660 --> 00:37:35.060
- [Duncan] Nor I.

425
00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:35.893
- Have you?

426
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:38.263
- No.

427
00:38:11.471 --> 00:38:13.388
- Where the hell is he?

428
00:38:16.869 --> 00:38:20.193
Well we may as well have
just cut our own throats.

429
00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:23.471
We must find him.

430
00:38:23.471 --> 00:38:24.980
- [Duncan] We'll have to
split up and search the house.

431
00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.600
- [Malcolm] But he knows
the house inside out.

432
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:29.850
- [George] Frightened of a servant boy?

433
00:38:29.850 --> 00:38:32.340
- [Malcolm] No. but I
worry about the king.

434
00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:33.940
- He's not going anywhere.

435
00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:36.230
- I'll stay with the king.

436
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:38.740
- You want to be at the epicenter?

437
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:43.740
- No. you're right. I should
help look round the house.

438
00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:50.492
- We'll need you to stay
by his Majesty's side.

439
00:38:50.492 --> 00:38:52.633
or the door to his bedroom at least.

440
00:38:54.590 --> 00:38:56.563
- Let us see if we can't raise a scent.

441
00:39:42.853 --> 00:39:45.520
(ominous music)

442
00:43:47.633 --> 00:43:51.063
- What have we here a
midnight chimney sweep?

443
00:43:55.290 --> 00:43:56.140
- I'm sorry. sir.

444
00:43:57.230 --> 00:43:58.733
- Sir. is it?

445
00:44:00.213 --> 00:44:01.046
- I'm not a chimney sweep.

446
00:44:01.046 --> 00:44:02.714
but there's nothing to be frightened of.

447
00:44:02.714 --> 00:44:03.810
- It looks as if that role

448
00:44:03.810 --> 00:44:06.423
falls squarely on your shoulders.

449
00:44:08.270 --> 00:44:10.010
- I will see to the mess. sir.

450
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:12.883
- Who is this sir you refer to?

451
00:44:14.997 --> 00:44:19.997
- I make no assumptions since
we have not been introduced.

452
00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:26.340
but I am Will the groundkeeper's
son for this house.

453
00:44:27.693 --> 00:44:29.460
I have no other role here.

454
00:44:29.460 --> 00:44:32.790
- Are all your guests treated
to the same pantomime.

455
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:35.210
or is this performance reserved

456
00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:38.833
for the elderly and generally infirm?

457
00:44:38.833 --> 00:44:40.483
- I can't help you. sir.

458
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:44.380
- Of course. you're
the groundkeeper's son.

459
00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:45.818
But I'm sure you know where

460
00:44:45.818 --> 00:44:47.370
the best of the wine is kept. don't you?

461
00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:49.616
I'm sure you know a lot about this house

462
00:44:49.616 --> 00:44:52.433
and what has transpired this evening.

463
00:44:54.297 --> 00:44:55.297
- But I'm only.

464
00:44:55.297 --> 00:44:57.693
- The groundkeeper's son.

465
00:44:57.693 --> 00:45:02.390
Tell me then where is the
groundkeeper's son's father?

466
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:04.653
- Well the house is closed for the season.

467
00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:07.531
It is my task to ensure the upkeep.

468
00:45:07.531 --> 00:45:11.690
small repairs. and control any vermin.

469
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:13.863
- Such as unwanted guests.

470
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.140
- Oh no. sir.

471
00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:17.423
- Do you know who we are?

472
00:45:18.450 --> 00:45:19.590
- No. sir.

473
00:45:19.590 --> 00:45:21.843
- Do you know who I am. then?

474
00:45:23.190 --> 00:45:26.770
- No. sir. we have not been introduced.

475
00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:29.360
- Do you not want to ask. who we are.

476
00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.020
who I am. and what gives us license

477
00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:36.000
to intrude on you on
this godforsaken night?

478
00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.290
- I wouldn't presume to
question your motives.

479
00:45:38.290 --> 00:45:41.823
- Why not. we may be thieves or bandits?

480
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:44.794
- I think that unlikely. sir.

481
00:45:44.794 --> 00:45:46.940
the others do not appear to be

482
00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:48.940
interested in the contents of the house.

483
00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:52.714
- Yes. the others. what have they conveyed

484
00:45:52.714 --> 00:45:55.623
to you about our identity.

485
00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:57.673
- Nothing.

486
00:45:58.540 --> 00:45:59.793
- You are not curious?

487
00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:02.090
- No. sir.

488
00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:04.074
- Even though they have
broken into this house

489
00:46:04.074 --> 00:46:07.130
and made free use of it for lodgings.

490
00:46:07.130 --> 00:46:10.490
and you placed with the
defense of this house.

491
00:46:10.490 --> 00:46:15.323
And taken liberties with your supplies.

492
00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:17.973
- I'll get you more wine. sir.

493
00:46:19.712 --> 00:46:20.545
- Stop.

494
00:46:25.434 --> 00:46:27.910
Answer me truthfully boy.
or you may lose your head.

495
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:29.010
Why were you up there?

496
00:46:30.576 --> 00:46:34.377
You've already admitted that
you're not a chimney sweep.

497
00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:37.500
- I was frightened.

498
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.940
- Of what. I thought you
are the groundkeeper's son.

499
00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:43.173
who has no thoughts or opinions.

500
00:46:43.173 --> 00:46:45.843
what have you to be scared of. the night?

501
00:46:47.274 --> 00:46:49.400
- I am confused.

502
00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:54.133
- You know that there
is something amiss here.

503
00:46:56.730 --> 00:46:58.693
you probably know more than me.

504
00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:03.032
- But I was sleeping when you

505
00:47:03.032 --> 00:47:05.310
and your friends broke
through to find shelter.

506
00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:06.560
- If it was just shelter.

507
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:09.360
then why not let us through anyway?

508
00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:10.810
And these friends you speak of.

509
00:47:10.810 --> 00:47:13.813
were they friendly or charitable to you?

510
00:47:13.813 --> 00:47:15.580
- Oh no. sir.

511
00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:18.170
- Then why assume they are such to me?

512
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:20.592
If any one of them claimed
to be my true friend.

513
00:47:20.592 --> 00:47:24.688
I should probably be as
worried as you claim you are.

514
00:47:24.688 --> 00:47:26.966
- But I saw them carry you in

515
00:47:26.966 --> 00:47:29.366
and they were concerned
for your well-being.

516
00:47:29.366 --> 00:47:32.726
They had a mighty
struggle to get you here.

517
00:47:32.726 --> 00:47:33.793
- Really?

518
00:47:34.950 --> 00:47:37.793
- Oh I mean the stairs is very narrow.

519
00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:42.010
And the corridors are very dark

520
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:46.013
and this is a difficult room to reach.

521
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:50.680
- I'm a hefty old ox who can barely

522
00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:52.460
walk at the best of times

523
00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.713
and they broke their lazy
backs getting me this far.

524
00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:59.740
It's probably the hardest
work they've seen all year.

525
00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:02.300
but now that I am up this far.

526
00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:05.943
they can scheme and weave
some gossip. like old women.

527
00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:09.850
- I see. you're their employer.

528
00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:12.613
- Yes. of sorts.

529
00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:16.663
I saw you downstairs in the main hall.

530
00:48:17.570 --> 00:48:19.940
You looked worried and left.

531
00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:21.810
What drew you back.

532
00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:23.253
- The cold air and the rain.

533
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:28.163
- Your honesty is refreshing. boy. Will.

534
00:48:30.330 --> 00:48:34.853
Well Will. let me introduce myself.

535
00:48:35.850 --> 00:48:36.853
I am Henry.

536
00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.620
- Pleased to meet you. Henry

537
00:48:42.140 --> 00:48:43.574
- I can see you must have thoroughly

538
00:48:43.574 --> 00:48:45.610
cleaned all the chimneys in the house.

539
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:48.763
judging by the amount you've
brought down with you.

540
00:48:51.110 --> 00:48:53.610
- So what happened to you?

541
00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:55.043
- I fell from a horse.

542
00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:58.690
Or perhaps I was pushed.

543
00:48:58.690 --> 00:49:02.690
it's all the same since I'm
left incapacitated by this.

544
00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.590
- It has been cleaned and bandaged.

545
00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:13.390
- And for that I should be grateful?

546
00:49:16.412 --> 00:49:17.593
- Oh.

547
00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:20.743
Nice ring.

548
00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.610
- It was downstairs.
by the main fireplace.

549
00:49:24.610 --> 00:49:26.690
I was going to return it.

550
00:49:26.690 --> 00:49:30.920
- So you decided to keep it on
your thumb for safe keeping?

551
00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.000
- Yes.

552
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.323
- Keep it I have plenty.

553
00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:38.340
Anyway what use are such trinkets.

554
00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:41.740
you can't take them with you when you go?

555
00:49:41.740 --> 00:49:43.440
- Yes you can Henry.

556
00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.220
I'll just get some butter to ease it off.

557
00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:47.377
- No Will. when you go.

558
00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.963
Or if Rome has it's way.

559
00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:59.760
- But your wound is clean. it will heal.

560
00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:04.210
- I am less concerned with
the wound. but how I got it.

561
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:06.390
- Falling off your horse. you said.

562
00:50:06.390 --> 00:50:08.950
- But why was mine the only one to fall

563
00:50:08.950 --> 00:50:10.460
and I the only one to be injured.

564
00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:13.613
and for it to happen here.
so far from anywhere?

565
00:50:14.697 --> 00:50:16.083
- And Rome?

566
00:50:17.050 --> 00:50:18.943
Why would Rome want you?

567
00:50:21.970 --> 00:50:25.873
- It's a long. but very interesting story.

568
00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:29.400
- But you're not going to tell me?

569
00:50:44.570 --> 00:50:49.570
- What do you think of the
current state of things?

570
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:53.370
- You'll probably be left with a scar.

571
00:50:53.370 --> 00:50:54.203
- Not that.

572
00:50:56.386 --> 00:50:58.253
The country is in turmoil I'm told.

573
00:50:59.666 --> 00:51:01.673
The people are unhappy I'm told.

574
00:51:02.887 --> 00:51:04.770
- Have you been away then. Henry. abroad?

575
00:51:04.770 --> 00:51:08.030
- In mind if not in body.

576
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:09.930
- I don't understand.

577
00:51:09.930 --> 00:51:11.640
- Would you fight for your country?

578
00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.473
- Yes.

579
00:51:12.473 --> 00:51:14.250
- Would you fight for your king?

580
00:51:14.250 --> 00:51:15.780
- Oh aye.

581
00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:19.873
- What opinion do you hold of our king?

582
00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:26.860
- I really need to get washed.

583
00:51:26.860 --> 00:51:30.023
This soot will stain my skin.
and these clothes are ruined.

584
00:51:34.562 --> 00:51:39.562
- Oh to be young again.
in the flush of youth.

585
00:51:41.490 --> 00:51:46.070
- But with maturity comes
dignity and respect.

586
00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:48.590
You have people who rely
on you for their wages.

587
00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:52.023
- I'd trade it all for my youth.

588
00:51:53.590 --> 00:51:55.680
- And lose the stature and the honor

589
00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:58.077
and the respect which you have earned?

590
00:51:59.850 --> 00:52:01.163
- I don't have long left.

591
00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.390
- No. your wound is healing.

592
00:52:04.390 --> 00:52:07.552
- I am tired. I have been fighting illness

593
00:52:07.552 --> 00:52:10.110
and I am weak with indifference.

594
00:52:10.110 --> 00:52:15.110
My few friends have deserted
me. my wives have left me.

595
00:52:16.330 --> 00:52:18.549
- You a widower then. Henry?

596
00:52:18.549 --> 00:52:21.173
- In more ways than one.

597
00:52:22.050 --> 00:52:25.823
- But. sir. there must be some family.

598
00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:30.160
- Too much family. too many relatives.

599
00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.170
cousins. brothers by law. fathers by law.

600
00:52:33.170 --> 00:52:38.140
sisters by law. the list
is endless and draining.

601
00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:41.133
I am spent.

602
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:48.010
- I will make peace with your friends

603
00:52:48.010 --> 00:52:50.010
and find you something to eat and drink.

604
00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:53.730
- You are naive if you think you

605
00:52:53.730 --> 00:52:55.780
can find a friend in that lot.

606
00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:58.740
- But they will do me no
harm now that we are friends.

607
00:52:58.740 --> 00:53:00.253
- The opposite is likely.

608
00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.800
You don't understand
what is happening here.

609
00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:08.230
We are not here by chance.

610
00:53:08.230 --> 00:53:10.490
It is no coincidence that we

611
00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:12.453
diverted to this side of London.

612
00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:19.024
It is by design that I am
here and with this wound

613
00:53:19.024 --> 00:53:24.024
I am convinced that I
will not see the morning.

614
00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:26.960
- But the storm is not here by design.

615
00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.433
- There is a traitor amongst us.

616
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:32.330
- Too much wine can do that.

617
00:53:32.330 --> 00:53:36.953
- I'm not a drunken old fool
who doesn't know his own mind.

618
00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:49.680
- What are you doing boy.

619
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:51.360
- This is an outrage.

620
00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.455
- Yes an outrage.

621
00:53:53.455 --> 00:53:56.070
- I didn't do anything. he did.

622
00:53:56.070 --> 00:53:57.683
- Hold you tongue boy.

623
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.875
- Your Majesty. our humblest of apologies.

624
00:54:00.875 --> 00:54:03.780
this rat must have tunneled around

625
00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:04.950
the chimney's of the house.

626
00:54:04.950 --> 00:54:06.053
- Your Majesty?

627
00:54:07.830 --> 00:54:08.663
- Fall to your knees boy in

628
00:54:08.663 --> 00:54:10.000
the presence of the King of England.

629
00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.763
- He has killed one of the guards.

630
00:54:12.933 --> 00:54:13.766
- I didn't kill him.

631
00:54:13.766 --> 00:54:14.833
- Silence.

632
00:54:14.833 --> 00:54:16.673
- Has anyone seen Catherine?

633
00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.403
I thought she was here.

634
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.230
- The king needs his rest.

635
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:28.083
- If you see Catherine. be
sure to send her through.

636
00:55:10.700 --> 00:55:12.313
- My darling Henry.

637
00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:23.690
- I fear for his Majesty's sanity.

638
00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:26.240
- His sanity is not ours to question.

639
00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.533
- Besides we have a murderer in our midst.

640
00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.360
- I never remembered you as being

641
00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:40.273
so coy in the presence of women.

642
00:55:43.072 --> 00:55:44.750
- What do you want?

643
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:46.050
- What I've always wanted.

644
00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:50.243
to be Queen and to serve
you and this country.

645
00:55:51.650 --> 00:55:52.483
- Who is it?

646
00:55:54.070 --> 00:55:54.903
Who's there?

647
00:55:56.610 --> 00:55:58.393
Catherine is it you?

648
00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.603
Get out you fool. get out.

649
00:56:11.504 --> 00:56:13.053
When I want you. you're not there.

650
00:56:25.727 --> 00:56:27.813
The first sign of madness.

651
00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.363
I'll be talking to myself next.

652
00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:39.463
Are you dying. too. dog?

653
00:56:44.411 --> 00:56:47.744
We will rot away in this place together.

654
00:56:50.016 --> 00:56:51.933
Does something ail you?

655
00:56:52.897 --> 00:56:55.810
Your past romantic encounters

656
00:56:55.810 --> 00:56:58.993
come to haunt you. after midnight.

657
00:57:02.169 --> 00:57:04.836
(ominous music)

658
00:57:30.004 --> 00:57:32.490
What is this?

659
00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:35.090
- It is what women were made for. Henry.

660
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:41.753
Do you not recognize the pleasure.

661
00:57:45.065 --> 00:57:48.123
the beauty. the joy.
of receiving your seed?

662
00:57:54.525 --> 00:57:56.275
- No make it go away.

663
00:57:59.900 --> 00:58:00.823
- As you wish.

664
00:58:01.980 --> 00:58:04.033
You always did get your own way. Henry.

665
00:58:09.980 --> 00:58:13.860
What is this. the king of the land

666
00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:17.961
frightened by the dark and the shadows?

667
00:58:17.961 --> 00:58:21.044
- I am frightened of no man or beast.

668
00:58:22.301 --> 00:58:23.384
- Which am I?

669
00:58:24.964 --> 00:58:26.800
- You sound familiar. yet alien.

670
00:58:32.250 --> 00:58:34.053
You remind me of someone. or somebody.

671
00:58:39.836 --> 00:58:43.419
yet your face is almost
that of a stranger.

672
00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:52.263
- Can you not face me. Henry?

673
00:58:53.709 --> 00:58:56.473
Or can you not face what you have done?

674
00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:03.560
- You have Catherine's eyes.

675
00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:07.933
Jane's smile. Anne's disposition.

676
00:59:11.820 --> 00:59:16.103
Are you any of these. or
are you a night demon.

677
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.360
a dream to torment me?

678
00:59:24.072 --> 00:59:25.489
- To torment you?

679
00:59:27.363 --> 00:59:29.128
Does this mean you admit

680
00:59:29.128 --> 00:59:32.295
to remorse or guilt for our treatment?

681
00:59:34.644 --> 00:59:38.668
- I am guilty of making
you Queen of England.

682
00:59:38.668 --> 00:59:41.001
the envy of all who see you.

683
00:59:42.110 --> 00:59:43.343
- At what price?

684
00:59:46.792 --> 00:59:49.709
- My sanity by the looks of things.

685
00:59:53.752 --> 00:59:58.093
- I was not barren. I was worse.

686
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.963
I was the receptacle of still born heirs.

687
01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:11.813
I was a whore. a schemer.

688
01:00:19.208 --> 01:00:21.875
(ominous music)

689
01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.240
- Your friend in the tower.

690
01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:52.250
who was he and what were
you conspiring together?

691
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:54.109
- You keep asking the same questions

692
01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:57.260
but I can only give you the same answers.

693
01:00:57.260 --> 01:00:59.780
There is nobody else
staying in this house.

694
01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:02.000
- I heard conversation.

695
01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.763
- I talk to myself.

696
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:13.890
- You know what treason is?

697
01:01:13.890 --> 01:01:15.663
- I would die for my country.

698
01:01:17.091 --> 01:01:18.829
- It may just come to that.

699
01:01:18.829 --> 01:01:21.272
- I think if he had anything to tell us.

700
01:01:21.272 --> 01:01:24.103
we would have heard it by now.

701
01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:28.010
- The king may be in danger.

702
01:01:28.010 --> 01:01:31.060
- His wound looks painful. but not fatal.

703
01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:33.693
- We have a physician in our midst.

704
01:01:35.010 --> 01:01:37.420
You have killed a man on this night. Will.

705
01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:40.460
and for that there is no escape.

706
01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:43.370
- But we may be able to help you.

707
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:45.510
- I didn't kill him. he fell.

708
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:48.170
- That will be for a judge to decide.

709
01:01:48.170 --> 01:01:50.543
- He was climbing the chimney. he fell.

710
01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:54.030
I cannot be tried for a
crime I did not commit.

711
01:01:54.030 --> 01:01:57.188
- If a man can kill he can surely lie.

712
01:01:57.188 --> 01:01:59.576
which is why your protests of innocence

713
01:01:59.576 --> 01:02:02.423
are falling on deaf ears.

714
01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:06.691
- You don't care whether
I'm guilty or not.

715
01:02:06.691 --> 01:02:07.867
That guard would probably have

716
01:02:07.867 --> 01:02:09.840
killed me if he'd gotten his hands on me.

717
01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.630
- So you admit to having
struggled with him?

718
01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:14.008
- Yes. but.

719
01:02:14.008 --> 01:02:15.230
- We can overlook this matter.

720
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:19.043
but only if you are
true and honest with us.

721
01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:29.580
- You said the king may be in danger.

722
01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:32.460
- Our king is gravely ill.

723
01:02:32.460 --> 01:02:36.789
His mind is occupied by
demons by day and night.

724
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:38.691
- And his dementia grows with

725
01:02:38.691 --> 01:02:41.270
each twist and turn of his life.

726
01:02:41.270 --> 01:02:42.810
- But he may well have good cause

727
01:02:42.810 --> 01:02:45.300
for suspicion on this night.

728
01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:48.773
- This is of the highest confidentiality.

729
01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.430
- [Will] I was confronted
by a man who claimed

730
01:03:03.430 --> 01:03:06.013
to be the king's friend. in the tower.

731
01:03:07.090 --> 01:03:08.613
He questioned my loyalty.

732
01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.693
He says that the king was in danger

733
01:03:11.693 --> 01:03:13.773
and that I was to help him.

734
01:03:14.926 --> 01:03:15.810
And there was some question about

735
01:03:15.810 --> 01:03:17.263
the survival of the monarchy.

736
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:21.163
- [George] Trying to
conscript an accomplice.

737
01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:23.090
- [Duncan] He would have left you

738
01:03:23.090 --> 01:03:25.783
with the consequences of his crime.

739
01:03:26.893 --> 01:03:28.531
- [Malcolm] You will be a national hero

740
01:03:28.531 --> 01:03:31.970
and the king will bestow you with honors.

741
01:03:31.970 --> 01:03:33.650
- [George] Your master will be informed

742
01:03:33.650 --> 01:03:36.213
of your courageous actions on his return.

743
01:04:02.484 --> 01:04:05.151
(ominous music)

744
01:04:28.702 --> 01:04:29.760
- [Thorn] I've been expecting you.

745
01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.410
- Why weren't you honest with me?

746
01:04:32.310 --> 01:04:33.600
- I didn't mislead you.

747
01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:34.950
- Our king lies injured

748
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:37.140
and you were busy playing games with me.

749
01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:39.110
- I had to be sure you could be trusted.

750
01:04:39.110 --> 01:04:40.380
- Trusted?

751
01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:42.190
To help you betray the country?

752
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:43.780
- That's not it at all.

753
01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:45.541
- You would have used
me for your own purposes

754
01:04:45.541 --> 01:04:48.943
and left me to take the full
punishment for your crime.

755
01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:52.123
I was a fool not to
see through you before.

756
01:04:52.123 --> 01:04:54.030
I met with the king.

757
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:56.422
- Oh really and how did you fair?

758
01:04:56.422 --> 01:05:00.730
- He wasn't the king in my
mind. just an injured old man.

759
01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:01.670
- Disappointed?

760
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:02.890
- Surprised.

761
01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:04.090
- That he was old and decrepit?

762
01:05:04.090 --> 01:05:09.090
- No. no. that he was just
so ordinary. so human.

763
01:05:10.360 --> 01:05:12.040
- That's a great truth. or lie isn't it

764
01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.100
depending on your point of
view about our monarchy.

765
01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.875
they're just people. same as you and I.

766
01:05:16.875 --> 01:05:19.890
The pageantry is their device
to persuade you otherwise.

767
01:05:19.890 --> 01:05:21.620
Behind all that pomp and ceremony

768
01:05:21.620 --> 01:05:24.593
lie terrified people
frightened of being caught out.

769
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:27.200
Weakness in the eyes of their subjects

770
01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:30.550
and eventual death is
the ultimate humiliation.

771
01:05:30.550 --> 01:05:31.800
- Is our King dying?

772
01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:34.000
- Yeah. we're all dying
from the day of our birth.

773
01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.853
He's having strange visitations.

774
01:05:37.790 --> 01:05:40.750
His past is catching up
with him. you might say.

775
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:41.800
- Past sins?

776
01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:43.750
- That and guilt.

777
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:44.960
Henry is being tortured by

778
01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.252
the images of his previous marriages.

779
01:05:47.252 --> 01:05:50.920
They do say life flashes in
front of you before you die.

780
01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:51.753
But tell me.

781
01:05:51.753 --> 01:05:55.830
if you didn't know he was
King Henry. did he tell you?

782
01:05:55.830 --> 01:05:58.283
- I was calling him Henry and sir.

783
01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.123
- Off to the tower and off with his head.

784
01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.920
Why can you not face me. Will?

785
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:07.260
- Because you are a traitor.

786
01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.390
- For having an opinion?

787
01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:11.573
- No. for the assassination
of the King of England.

788
01:06:11.573 --> 01:06:14.612
- You fool. what have you done?

789
01:06:14.612 --> 01:06:15.640
- I have met the king.

790
01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:17.100
For all his faults he is a good man

791
01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:18.883
who doesn't deserve to be slaughtered.

792
01:06:23.892 --> 01:06:26.559
(ominous music)

793
01:06:49.850 --> 01:06:54.160
- Even in death you women are a torment.

794
01:06:55.343 --> 01:06:58.380
Was I such a bad husband?

795
01:06:58.380 --> 01:06:59.213
Was I?

796
01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:05.090
Even you damn dog. have an opinion.

797
01:07:05.090 --> 01:07:05.997
Damn you all.

798
01:07:09.732 --> 01:07:11.565
I am spent and broken.

799
01:07:14.212 --> 01:07:17.753
England is spent and broken.

800
01:07:21.252 --> 01:07:23.252
Is this how it will end?

801
01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:26.417
(thunder)

802
01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.493
- Quite a gathering. I am honored.

803
01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:50.520
- Keep your mouth shut.

804
01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:52.400
- It'll be just you then?

805
01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.670
- No more questions.

806
01:07:53.670 --> 01:07:55.220
- You won't get away with this.

807
01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:01.880
- I think that you will find that it

808
01:08:01.880 --> 01:08:04.723
is you who will not be
getting away with anything.

809
01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:07.653
- Trust the others. do you?

810
01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.463
- We all have the same goal.

811
01:08:11.368 --> 01:08:12.318
- Of that I'm sure.

812
01:08:13.430 --> 01:08:14.600
- Meaning?

813
01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.520
- I've been watching you all this night.

814
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:18.240
None of you could claim
to be without some sin.

815
01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:20.363
this of all nights.

816
01:08:21.690 --> 01:08:24.903
- Silence. the others are coming.

817
01:08:26.082 --> 01:08:27.590
- There are dead guards in the cellar.

818
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:29.690
I'm sure they didn't fall on their swords.

819
01:08:38.010 --> 01:08:39.173
Too close to the bone.

820
01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.103
- Problems?

821
01:08:48.642 --> 01:08:50.142
- I need some air.

822
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:32.420
- I know what's going on here.

823
01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:34.553
- You'll be beheaded for treason.

824
01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.390
- You may as well confess

825
01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:40.940
and cleanse yourself
before the eyes of god.

826
01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:41.880
- Very good.

827
01:09:41.880 --> 01:09:43.150
You'll have them crying in Rome.

828
01:09:43.150 --> 01:09:45.870
- We have the king's
best interests at heart.

829
01:09:45.870 --> 01:09:49.162
- You all have you own
agendas. of that much I'm sure.

830
01:09:49.162 --> 01:09:52.210
But who the architect is
I haven't quite decided.

831
01:09:52.210 --> 01:09:54.210
Your guards are dead and not by my hand.

832
01:09:56.076 --> 01:09:57.443
And where's your third wheel?

833
01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:00.400
Busy preparing something perhaps?

834
01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:04.563
- Trying to undermine us will
not throw suspicion from you.

835
01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:11.263
- No more questions?

836
01:10:22.830 --> 01:10:24.530
- We must keep his Majesty informed

837
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:26.420
- Very concerned all of a sudden.

838
01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:27.634
- Meaning?

839
01:10:27.634 --> 01:10:30.540
- We can't argue amongst
ourselves that's what he wants.

840
01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:33.700
- We should keep the King up
to date with all developments.

841
01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.320
- Just in case things don't work out.

842
01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:38.000
- That's preposterous.
I have no hidden agenda.

843
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.603
- Would any of us admit if we had?

844
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:46.103
- He's gone.

845
01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:48.920
We must protect the king.

846
01:10:52.353 --> 01:10:55.020
(ominous music)

847
01:11:37.311 --> 01:11:39.880
- Who are you and what do you want?

848
01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:41.390
- It is Will. your Majesty.

849
01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:44.660
- Will who?

850
01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:45.850
Have you come to rob me?

851
01:11:45.850 --> 01:11:49.023
- No. sire. I spoke with
you a short while ago.

852
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:52.520
- You're not another night demon?

853
01:11:54.190 --> 01:11:56.690
I've had all I can take
of visitations this night.

854
01:12:01.050 --> 01:12:02.887
You're a thief and a liar.

855
01:12:16.415 --> 01:12:18.082
This is not my home.

856
01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.253
- Your injury. sire.

857
01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:29.647
- I'd forgotten about that
and you too for that matter.

858
01:12:36.313 --> 01:12:37.146
No.

859
01:12:38.190 --> 01:12:39.023
I'm sick of bed.

860
01:12:40.311 --> 01:12:44.380
With the size of me. I've
outlived several dozen beds.

861
01:12:44.380 --> 01:12:47.340
My legs are ulcerated.

862
01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.800
Lying in bed makes me feel even

863
01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:51.543
more of an invalid than I am.

864
01:12:53.810 --> 01:12:55.063
Oh. leave it.

865
01:12:56.890 --> 01:13:00.703
It's coming back. slowly.

866
01:13:02.669 --> 01:13:05.153
At my age a poor memory
is a positive advantage.

867
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:11.550
The life I've had a patchy
memory can be a comfort.

868
01:13:13.060 --> 01:13:17.800
You seem less talkative now. Will.

869
01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.683
- Yes. your Majesty.

870
01:13:19.683 --> 01:13:24.350
- I preferred it when
you called me sir. Henry.

871
01:13:24.350 --> 01:13:28.483
Not even my wives would often
call me by my born name.

872
01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.763
Are you in awe of your king.

873
01:13:36.877 --> 01:13:39.433
or scared for your life. Will?

874
01:13:40.670 --> 01:13:42.617
- Both your Majesty.

875
01:13:45.095 --> 01:13:47.660
- You wouldn't last a day in my court.

876
01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:49.563
Your honesty would be your down fall.

877
01:13:51.370 --> 01:13:55.090
There is little I can offer
you. so you can keep the ring.

878
01:13:55.090 --> 01:13:57.363
It can be your wage for tonight.

879
01:13:59.150 --> 01:14:04.150
Are you paid much as groundkeeper's son?

880
01:14:07.020 --> 01:14:08.970
You see I did remember?

881
01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:12.083
- It's been some time since
I was last paid your Majesty.

882
01:14:13.421 --> 01:14:17.512
You see I haven't been entirely
truthful about this house.

883
01:14:17.512 --> 01:14:21.100
- I haven't been entirely
truthful my entire life.

884
01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:22.773
so I'll forgive just one night.

885
01:14:24.600 --> 01:14:27.250
There is much about this country which

886
01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:31.103
I choose not to look at. or listen to.

887
01:14:32.570 --> 01:14:33.830
A King who understands

888
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:38.280
his subjects. his people. too intimately

889
01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:41.369
is in danger of becoming
one of those subjects.

890
01:14:41.369 --> 01:14:45.403
on the inside looking out.

891
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:51.193
- The house is closed. but
not just for the season.

892
01:14:52.950 --> 01:14:56.873
The library is without
books. they were sold.

893
01:14:58.310 --> 01:15:00.550
as have most of the
possessions in the house

894
01:15:01.515 --> 01:15:03.840
and the staff in the
main have been let go.

895
01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:04.673
- In the main?

896
01:15:05.870 --> 01:15:07.489
I would have said in the entirety.

897
01:15:07.489 --> 01:15:10.150
present company excepted.

898
01:15:10.150 --> 01:15:14.300
And the reason for this thrifty attitude?

899
01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:15.133
- Your Majesty?

900
01:15:15.133 --> 01:15:17.963
- Why is the house dying?

901
01:15:17.963 --> 01:15:20.640
- Taxes your Majesty.

902
01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:24.811
- To keep a fat king fatter
and the warriors fighting.

903
01:15:24.811 --> 01:15:26.978
That's what taxes are for.

904
01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:32.413
The campaign we fought three
years ago cost us dearly.

905
01:15:33.559 --> 01:15:35.280
I demanded benevolence. sold land.

906
01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:38.165
and let us not forget the debasement

907
01:15:38.165 --> 01:15:40.300
of the great English coinage.

908
01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:44.213
All these charges can be
fairly laid at my door.

909
01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:48.710
Did you know that I re-minted the coin

910
01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:50.905
which is now mostly base metal

911
01:15:50.905 --> 01:15:53.705
an enterprise which yielded a good deal

912
01:15:53.705 --> 01:15:56.302
but not nearly enough to see us

913
01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:59.410
through our present
financial difficulties.

914
01:15:59.410 --> 01:16:00.410
- But you have led us well

915
01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:02.830
against France and Scotland. your Majesty.

916
01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:05.790
- Mostly people love their
money before their country.

917
01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:07.690
Just ask your master
which he would prefer.

918
01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:09.020
I dare say he wouldn't like

919
01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:13.930
me lounging upon his hospitality.

920
01:16:13.930 --> 01:16:16.310
- I wouldn't have said so. your Majesty.

921
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:19.090
- When you're a monarch of my age.

922
01:16:19.090 --> 01:16:20.783
death comes as quite a relief.

923
01:16:22.090 --> 01:16:25.398
There is one final game of course.

924
01:16:25.398 --> 01:16:27.793
one great battle which you must fight.

925
01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:31.465
The timing of death is
something for historians.

926
01:16:31.465 --> 01:16:34.513
but the method can be one of gossip.

927
01:16:36.540 --> 01:16:40.827
The head of Henry is a valuable
currency in some circles.

928
01:16:41.690 --> 01:16:42.690
As you may have gathered.

929
01:16:42.690 --> 01:16:45.087
my enemies far outweigh my friends.

930
01:16:45.087 --> 01:16:47.413
or should I say acquaintances.

931
01:16:48.579 --> 01:16:53.033
since a true king has no
friends. subjects at best.

932
01:16:55.030 --> 01:16:58.223
but eventual enemies in the making.

933
01:16:59.950 --> 01:17:02.123
One of the few constants.

934
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:10.250
- But your children. your Majesty?

935
01:17:12.598 --> 01:17:16.840
- Mostly poisoned by the wicked
tongues of their mothers.

936
01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.597
Although my son Edward will rule.

937
01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:23.030
I must formulate a
council before my demise.

938
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:25.000
They all talk about my demise.

939
01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.180
It's treason to foretell
the death of a king.

940
01:17:28.180 --> 01:17:30.036
Lord Hungerford. lost his life

941
01:17:30.036 --> 01:17:34.383
by trying to predict the demise of mine.

942
01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:41.230
It's not so much when I
expect to be set upon.

943
01:17:41.230 --> 01:17:42.750
As I have taught my best men.

944
01:17:42.750 --> 01:17:45.238
take your enemy when he is at his weakest.

945
01:17:45.238 --> 01:17:49.490
But the question of who
can be a vexing one.

946
01:17:49.490 --> 01:17:52.483
There are so many potential candidates.

947
01:17:53.490 --> 01:17:55.193
This situation is an example.

948
01:17:56.270 --> 01:18:00.067
Even before we left the palace.
there was something amiss.

949
01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:05.320
It's the only diversion which
stimulates me these days.

950
01:18:05.320 --> 01:18:10.320
They circle me. waiting
for me to die. like hawks.

951
01:18:13.630 --> 01:18:17.860
These legs have lasted beyond their duty.

952
01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:22.003
I lose count of the differing
camps of my enemies.

953
01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:25.824
the grievances from the humble

954
01:18:25.824 --> 01:18:30.824
subject up to the Church and Rome.

955
01:18:34.810 --> 01:18:37.023
- I think you'll be glad
to know your Majesty.

956
01:18:38.470 --> 01:18:41.583
that there is now no need for
concern regarding the attack.

957
01:18:42.930 --> 01:18:44.250
They got him on the roof.

958
01:18:46.122 --> 01:18:49.862
- Got who for what?

959
01:18:49.862 --> 01:18:51.612
- Thorn your Majesty.

960
01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.393
- What?

961
01:18:56.144 --> 01:18:59.227
You had better explain what you know.

962
01:19:08.456 --> 01:19:11.123
(ominous music)

963
01:20:24.494 --> 01:20:26.630
I cannot make another step.

964
01:20:26.630 --> 01:20:28.773
- Please your Majesty you must try.

965
01:20:58.275 --> 01:20:59.108
My god.

966
01:21:03.513 --> 01:21:05.893
- I don't think he's with us tonight.

967
01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:11.993
Think yourselves lucky
you're already dead.

968
01:21:17.090 --> 01:21:19.923
So this is a library without books.

969
01:21:22.558 --> 01:21:25.183
- Your Majesty. your Majesty.

970
01:21:26.250 --> 01:21:29.270
- Please I preferred plain old Henry.

971
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:32.100
- Please Henry. we haven't got much time.

972
01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.600
- I have done the last of
my running. for tonight.

973
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:38.373
Probably done the last running of my life.

974
01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:51.083
You.

975
01:21:53.810 --> 01:21:54.810
- For England.

976
01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:11.773
- Your Majesty.

977
01:22:15.299 --> 01:22:18.963
- You cut time to its finest point.

978
01:22:21.420 --> 01:22:22.973
We must both be getting old.

979
01:22:25.337 --> 01:22:26.243
- But the others.

980
01:22:28.215 --> 01:22:31.160
- A king as old as me has
enemies from every direction.

981
01:22:31.160 --> 01:22:32.550
- I fear your Majesty you may have kept

982
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:34.603
your enemies too close on this occasion.

983
01:22:35.490 --> 01:22:39.070
- The line between friend
and foe is blurred.

984
01:22:41.230 --> 01:22:45.123
My most loyal and oldest
friends have betrayed me.

985
01:22:46.410 --> 01:22:48.070
- Like rotten apples.

986
01:22:48.070 --> 01:22:51.070
- Your enemies are falling over
them selves to be the first.

987
01:22:53.620 --> 01:22:56.073
- And killing themselves in the process.

988
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:36.350
- [William] King Henry VIII died

989
01:23:36.350 --> 01:23:40.763
on January 28th 1547 around midnight.

990
01:23:41.620 --> 01:23:44.790
His death was kept secret for three days.

991
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:47.160
During her reign Queen Mary.

992
01:23:47.160 --> 01:23:49.188
his first daughter by his first marriage.

993
01:23:49.188 --> 01:23:51.571
had the body of her father. Henry.

994
01:23:51.571 --> 01:23:55.828
exhumed and as an unrepentant
schismatic and heretic

995
01:23:55.828 --> 01:23:58.157
committed to the flames.

996
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:04.533
(somber music)
