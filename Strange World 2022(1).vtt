00:01:03.481 --> 00:01:06.108
NARRATOR: Welcome.
explorers. to Avalonia.

4
00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:07.693
A modest civilization

5
00:01:07.777 --> 00:01:09.487
trapped behind an impassable ring

6
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.363
of never-ending mountains.

7
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.491
whose citizens strive to do their best

8
00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:15.326
despite their humble means.

9
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:18.412
Believing the key to their future

10
00:01:18.496 --> 00:01:20.206
lies beyond these mountains.

11
00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:22.333
many have tried to get past them.

12
00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:25.419
All have failed.

13
00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:26.962
But hope has arrived.

14
00:01:27.046 --> 00:01:30.466
as Avalonia's greatest
explorers. the Clades.

15
00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:33.928
have now set their sights
on pulling off the impossible.

16
00:01:34.136 --> 00:01:36.305
Meet Jaeger Clade!

17
00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:38.057
Jaeger Clade

18
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.350
Jaeger Clade

19
00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:42.686
Never heard the meaning
Of the word afraid

20
00:01:42.853 --> 00:01:44.188
Hard as nails

21
00:01:44.355 --> 00:01:45.731
Blazing trails

22
00:01:45.898 --> 00:01:47.608
Staring danger in the eyes

23
00:01:47.775 --> 00:01:50.903
He's the manliest of guys
Jaeger Clade

24
00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.238
The one and only!

25
00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:54.490
NARRATOR:
And who's this by his side?

26
00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:57.284
Why. it's none other than
his bouncing baby boy.

27
00:01:57.368 --> 00:01:58.369
Searcher.

28
00:01:58.452 --> 00:02:01.288
MALE CHORUS: Searcher Clade
Searcher Clade

29
00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:04.416
Joining Dad
on every new crusade

30
00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:05.876
Iron-willed

31
00:02:06.043 --> 00:02:07.419
Smaller build

32
00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:09.088
He's the apple from the tree

33
00:02:09.255 --> 00:02:10.548
With a thing for botany

34
00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:12.383
Searcher Clade

35
00:02:12.758 --> 00:02:14.760
NARRATOR: Together.
these two are destined

36
00:02:14.844 --> 00:02:16.095
to finally find a route

37
00:02:16.178 --> 00:02:18.305
through these impassable peaks.

38
00:02:18.722 --> 00:02:20.516
No matter the cost.

39
00:02:21.684 --> 00:02:23.227
Over rugged mountains crawling

40
00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.146
Or raging waters falling
In cascades

41
00:02:26.272 --> 00:02:27.731
They're the Clades

42
00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:32.194
On their daring escapades

43
00:02:32.444 --> 00:02:33.946
They're the Clades

44
00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:39.827
All right. Searcher.

45
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.579
the path to the other side
of the mountains

46
00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:44.331
is through this cave.
How are you holding up?

47
00:02:44.415 --> 00:02:47.042
Great. Pretty sure
all my toes are frozen off

48
00:02:47.126 --> 00:02:48.586
so at least they don't hurt anymore.

49
00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:52.172
Well. as I always say.
"Exploration is snow joke."

50
00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:53.883
-Wow.

51
00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:55.634
-Shelter!
-JAEGER: Ooh!

52
00:02:55.718 --> 00:02:57.887
This is exactly what we need.

53
00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.143
Sorry! Sorry.

54
00:03:04.643 --> 00:03:05.853
-

55
00:03:10.024 --> 00:03:11.108
Shh.

56
00:03:43.557 --> 00:03:44.558
Whoa.

57
00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:47.227
-What are you?
-

58
00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:48.771
-

59
00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:52.191
Run!

60
00:03:59.657 --> 00:04:01.200
-Searcher!

61
00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:10.834
Dad.

62
00:04:12.294 --> 00:04:13.545
-JAEGER: Got ya.
-

63
00:04:14.213 --> 00:04:16.256
-

64
00:04:22.554 --> 00:04:25.265
Another close call. eh. Searcher?

65
00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:31.438
Do you see that. everyone?

66
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:34.984
They'll be telling our story
for generations to come!

67
00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:37.111
For what lies beyond that horizon

68
00:04:37.194 --> 00:04:40.364
is Avalonia's future and our glory.

69
00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:41.448
Hey. Dad.

70
00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.283
What about these plants?

71
00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:45.494
There's literally power
surging through them.

72
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.791
Well. Searcher. I do love
your inquisitive spirit.

73
00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:52.876
but our crew didn't come all this way

74
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.171
just to get distracted
by some sparkly plants.

75
00:04:56.255 --> 00:04:57.715
Yes. Dad.

76
00:04:57.798 --> 00:05:01.468
but "our crew" did come
out here to make a discovery

77
00:05:01.552 --> 00:05:02.761
that could change Avalonia.

78
00:05:02.845 --> 00:05:04.221
-Right?
-

79
00:05:04.304 --> 00:05:06.390
The discovery "our crew" is looking for

80
00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:09.018
is on the other side of these mountains

81
00:05:09.101 --> 00:05:11.478
because that's Avalonia's future.

82
00:05:11.562 --> 00:05:14.857
But if "our crew" would just
take a look at these plants...

83
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.066
-Ooh.
-...they could see

84
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.819
that Avalonia's future
might be right here.

85
00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:20.738
This crew has been training

86
00:05:20.821 --> 00:05:23.490
since they were a baby to do one thing.

87
00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:24.950
-Cartography.
-Nope.

88
00:05:25.034 --> 00:05:29.329
And that one thing is to walk
with me beyond that horizon.

89
00:05:29.413 --> 00:05:31.790
But did you ever bother
to even ask "the crew"

90
00:05:31.874 --> 00:05:33.083
if that's what they really wanted?

91
00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:36.295
Oh. they're not really talking
about the crew. are they?

92
00:05:36.378 --> 00:05:39.590
Searcher. we're explorers. not gardeners.

93
00:05:39.757 --> 00:05:42.885
Conquering those mountains is our legacy.

94
00:05:42.968 --> 00:05:44.470
No. Dad. It's yours.

95
00:05:44.553 --> 00:05:46.680
Enough. You're my son.

96
00:05:46.764 --> 00:05:48.057
But I'm not you.

97
00:05:51.018 --> 00:05:52.102
I'm not you.

98
00:05:53.395 --> 00:05:55.731
I don't mean to interrupt.

99
00:05:55.814 --> 00:05:57.524
but I actually think Baby Clade's right.

100
00:05:57.608 --> 00:05:58.609
Callisto?

101
00:05:58.692 --> 00:06:01.403
Jaeger. we don't actually know
what's past the mountains.

102
00:06:01.487 --> 00:06:04.031
But these plants here are real.

103
00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:06.700
We owe it to Avalonia
to see what they can do.

104
00:06:13.665 --> 00:06:14.750
Here.

105
00:06:14.917 --> 00:06:17.252
You'll need this to find your way home.

106
00:06:17.586 --> 00:06:18.587
What?

107
00:06:20.422 --> 00:06:21.548
Jaeger.

108
00:06:21.632 --> 00:06:22.883
Come back.

109
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:24.551
Dad. wait.

110
00:06:24.635 --> 00:06:25.677
-CALLISTO: Jaeger.
-Dad.

111
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:27.763
CALLISTO: You can't survive
out there alone.

112
00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:29.181
SEARCHER: Dad. stop!

113
00:06:47.491 --> 00:06:50.119
-

114
00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.842
Morning. Mr. Clade.

115
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.427
Rory. Mr. Clade
was my dad's name.

116
00:07:07.511 --> 00:07:08.512
Call me Searcher.

117
00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.681
I can't do that. Mr. Clade.

118
00:07:10.848 --> 00:07:13.392
That would be disrespectful
to the father of Pando.

119
00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:14.893
If it weren't for what you discovered.

120
00:07:14.977 --> 00:07:17.020
there'd be no power. or lights. or cars.

121
00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:19.231
-or radios. or...
-Okay. okay. Thanks. Rory.

122
00:07:19.314 --> 00:07:21.900
Ugh. I enjoy our little talks.

123
00:07:21.984 --> 00:07:23.193
Bye. Mr. Clade.

124
00:07:28.198 --> 00:07:29.616
Good morning. Avalonia!

125
00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.660
It looks like after a week of downpours.

126
00:07:31.827 --> 00:07:34.496
we finally have a beautiful.
sunny day ahead of us.

127
00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:36.665
MAN: Which is great
for all you Pando farmers out there.

128
00:07:36.874 --> 00:07:38.458
You need to harvest those crops.

129
00:07:38.542 --> 00:07:40.127
WOMAN: Yeah.
let's not run out of Pando.

130
00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:41.587
No Pando means no power.

131
00:07:41.753 --> 00:07:43.547
MAN: Back to horse and buggy?
No. thank you!

132
00:07:43.714 --> 00:07:44.965
I like my airship.

133
00:07:45.132 --> 00:07:48.051
Meridian! Ethan! Breakfast!

134
00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:49.928
MAN: In other news.
President Callisto Mal

135
00:07:50.012 --> 00:07:51.805
is getting ready
for a much-deserved vacation.

136
00:07:53.932 --> 00:07:56.018
-Morning. babe.
-Coffee first.

137
00:07:56.393 --> 00:07:58.312
-Good morning later.
-I got you.

138
00:08:01.857 --> 00:08:03.567
MERIDIAN: Mm...
ETHAN: Ew.

139
00:08:03.734 --> 00:08:05.027
This is the first image

140
00:08:05.110 --> 00:08:07.070
that has to be imprinted
on my brain this morning?

141
00:08:07.154 --> 00:08:09.281
Oh. Ethan. does this bother you?

142
00:08:09.364 --> 00:08:11.450
Ugh. impossible.
I mean. what 16-year-old boy

143
00:08:11.533 --> 00:08:13.243
doesn't like seeing
their parents smooch?

144
00:08:13.327 --> 00:08:15.204
-MERIDIAN: Mm-hmm.
-Okay. okay! Ugh.

145
00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:16.288
You know. I hope you know

146
00:08:16.371 --> 00:08:18.040
that you're emotionally
scarring Legend.

147
00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:20.125
Yeah.
He looks real upset.

148
00:08:20.209 --> 00:08:22.419
Looks like someone

149
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:24.087
forgot to weed the north field.

150
00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:25.923
Father. what is a weed

151
00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:27.799
other than a plant
growing somewhere

152
00:08:27.883 --> 00:08:29.885
that you find inconvenient?

153
00:08:29.968 --> 00:08:32.221
Ah. I appreciate how clever you are.

154
00:08:32.304 --> 00:08:33.931
But you know
what I'd appreciate more?

155
00:08:34.139 --> 00:08:36.099
If I weeded the north field?

156
00:08:36.266 --> 00:08:37.851
You see? So clever.

157
00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:39.937
-ETHAN: Come on!

158
00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:49.863
Whoo!
-

159
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:05.712
SEARCHER: Ha-ha!
ETHAN: Hey!

160
00:09:05.796 --> 00:09:06.797
SEARCHER: Come on!

161
00:09:10.384 --> 00:09:12.052
-

162
00:09:23.981 --> 00:09:25.232
MERIDIAN: Searcher!

163
00:09:27.609 --> 00:09:30.153
-Hey. hon. What's up?
-Oh. my engine stalled out.

164
00:09:30.237 --> 00:09:31.363
Can you give me a hand?

165
00:09:32.364 --> 00:09:33.740
Too much hotdoggin'. huh?

166
00:09:33.824 --> 00:09:35.951
Is there such a thing?

167
00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:40.038
Hmm. Pando battery's dead.

168
00:09:40.205 --> 00:09:41.707
That doesn't make any sense.

169
00:09:41.999 --> 00:09:43.750
I picked those pods an hour ago.

170
00:09:43.834 --> 00:09:46.211
Eh. pest must be gettin'
in the root system again.

171
00:09:46.503 --> 00:09:48.088
Well. I'll give our field
some extra love

172
00:09:48.255 --> 00:09:49.715
as soon as I get the duster
back in the air.

173
00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.591
-BOY: Ethan!
-

174
00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:54.011
Hey. the crew's here.

175
00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:55.679
Ethan's crew. Not your crew.

176
00:09:55.846 --> 00:09:57.472
Yeah. but his friends love me.

177
00:09:57.556 --> 00:09:59.057
No. we talked about this.

178
00:09:59.141 --> 00:10:01.184
Ethan's a teenager. Boundaries.

179
00:10:01.351 --> 00:10:02.644
Yeah. yeah. Boundaries. Got it.

180
00:10:05.105 --> 00:10:06.356
-Ethan.

181
00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.150
-What's up. Ethan?
-Whoa! Ethan. Ethan.

182
00:10:08.358 --> 00:10:09.901
Kardez. Kardez. what?

183
00:10:09.985 --> 00:10:11.528
We just came back
from the game shop.

184
00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:14.031
The special edition of
Primal Outpost just dropped.

185
00:10:14.197 --> 00:10:16.074
They sold out in 15 minutes.

186
00:10:16.158 --> 00:10:18.118
What? They sold out already?

187
00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:19.619
Argh. I knew
I should've camped out.

188
00:10:19.703 --> 00:10:22.164
Don't worry.
We didn't forget about you.

189
00:10:23.749 --> 00:10:25.334
Hey. Diazo.

190
00:10:25.417 --> 00:10:26.501
I didn't see you there.

191
00:10:26.585 --> 00:10:28.253
Not that you're not noticeable.

192
00:10:28.337 --> 00:10:30.756
I just. um. it was just. uh...

193
00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:31.840
What's up? Hey.

194
00:10:31.923 --> 00:10:33.383
I knew you had to work
this morning

195
00:10:33.467 --> 00:10:35.385
so I made sure
we grabbed you a pack.

196
00:10:35.552 --> 00:10:38.513
You did?
That's... That's really sweet.

197
00:10:38.597 --> 00:10:39.681
GIRL: Ugh.
Okay. we have allotted

198
00:10:39.765 --> 00:10:41.975
three to five minutes
of cute flirtation.

199
00:10:42.059 --> 00:10:43.185
Can we open our packs already?

200
00:10:43.352 --> 00:10:45.437
Yo. I hear
the new creatures are steep.

201
00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.647
Medic.

202
00:10:49.358 --> 00:10:50.817
I'm gonna make some stuff.

203
00:10:50.984 --> 00:10:51.985
ETHAN: Farmer.

204
00:10:55.072 --> 00:10:56.615
Here. I'll trade you.

205
00:10:56.782 --> 00:10:59.701
This one feels more Ethan to me.

206
00:11:04.373 --> 00:11:06.958
Isn't your grandpa.
like. a famous explorer?

207
00:11:07.125 --> 00:11:09.211
Maybe it's in your blood.

208
00:11:09.711 --> 00:11:10.712
-ETHAN: Hmm.
-

209
00:11:10.796 --> 00:11:12.214
He kinda looks like you.

210
00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:14.966
Except for that.

211
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:16.885
No! Hey. Diazo.
-

212
00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:19.096
-Give it back.
-

213
00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:21.264
Hey. gang. What's the haps?

214
00:11:21.348 --> 00:11:22.808
Dad. what are you doing?

215
00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:24.267
-Ooh. is this him?
- Dad. No.

216
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:25.352
-'Sup.
-No.

217
00:11:25.435 --> 00:11:26.853
-I'm Ethan's dad. Searcher.
-

218
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.981
You must be Diazo.

219
00:11:30.065 --> 00:11:31.191
He talks about you all the time.

220
00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:32.901
Not all the time.

221
00:11:32.984 --> 00:11:35.695
Maybe sometimes or on occasion.

222
00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:37.030
So. Diazo.

223
00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:38.240
Tell me about yourself.

224
00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:39.741
That's not really necessary.

225
00:11:39.825 --> 00:11:40.909
Are you into farming?

226
00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:42.536
Because Ethan
is an amazing farmer.

227
00:11:42.702 --> 00:11:43.829
-You should see him out there.
-Huh?

228
00:11:43.912 --> 00:11:46.581
He's strong. smart. super cool.

229
00:11:46.748 --> 00:11:49.126
Or as you kids say. steep.

230
00:11:50.293 --> 00:11:51.336
-Wow.
-Okay.

231
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.587
Don't we have
some deliveries to make?

232
00:11:52.671 --> 00:11:55.173
-Oh. right. Right.
-Sorry. guys. We gotta go now.

233
00:11:55.257 --> 00:11:59.052
Apologies that my dad
is so dad. Bye.

234
00:11:59.136 --> 00:12:00.971
-DIAZO: Bye. Ethan.
-Farewell. Ethan.

235
00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:02.222
Bye. Ethan's dad.

236
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.599
Hey. Diazo seems cool.
I see why you like him.

237
00:12:04.683 --> 00:12:06.476
-Please stop talking.
-I remember my first crush.

238
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.562
-Why are you still talking?
-She had braces. I did too.

239
00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:09.729
-Stop. Please.
-And then one time

240
00:12:09.813 --> 00:12:11.022
-we got stuck...
-

241
00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:12.399
SEARCHER: ...and it wasn't
such a bad thing.

242
00:12:12.482 --> 00:12:14.151
ETHAN: What is happening
to my life?

243
00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:35.755
Hey!

244
00:12:38.467 --> 00:12:39.509
Hey!

245
00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:50.187
Thanks. Searcher.

246
00:12:50.353 --> 00:12:51.354
Oh. thanks. Ethan.

247
00:12:51.688 --> 00:12:52.689
Thank you.

248
00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:09.998
-There you go.
-Thanks. Searcher.

249
00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:12.334
-Legend. go get it.
-WOMAN: Wow.

250
00:13:12.709 --> 00:13:14.044
Would you look at that.

251
00:13:14.211 --> 00:13:16.213
Three generations of Clades.

252
00:13:16.379 --> 00:13:18.548
I wonder which one Ethan takes after.

253
00:13:18.715 --> 00:13:20.342
I think that's pretty obvious.

254
00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:27.474
You know. he's gonna grow up
to be just like me.

255
00:13:27.557 --> 00:13:29.434
And leave you. just like I did.

256
00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.145
Ugh!

257
00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:37.234
You okay. Searcher?

258
00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:38.818
Oh. yep. yeah.

259
00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:40.862
Uh. we'll see you next week. Ro.

260
00:13:41.196 --> 00:13:42.864
Come on. Ethan. Let's go.

261
00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.830
You know. I bet your dad
would be really proud

262
00:13:50.914 --> 00:13:52.123
of everything you've accomplished.

263
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.627
You clearly don't know anything

264
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:56.753
about your grandpa.

265
00:13:56.836 --> 00:13:59.381
I mean. I would
if you ever talked about him.

266
00:14:00.674 --> 00:14:02.801
-Hmm.
-Dad. he's my grandfather.

267
00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:04.261
I want to know about him.

268
00:14:04.427 --> 00:14:05.470
From you.

269
00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.100
Everyone thinks of Jaeger Clade

270
00:14:10.183 --> 00:14:11.351
as this amazing hero.

271
00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:14.896
But that's only because
they didn't have him as a father.

272
00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:19.693
To me. he was
just a really bad dad.

273
00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:21.778
And he didn't care about me.

274
00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.406
he only cared about
conquering those mountains.

275
00:14:25.323 --> 00:14:27.659
And I only care about you.

276
00:14:27.826 --> 00:14:30.412
our family and our farm.

277
00:14:32.581 --> 00:14:35.750
Well. I guess that's what
makes you a pretty good dad.

278
00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:37.043
Wait. What was that?

279
00:14:37.210 --> 00:14:38.211
Uh. nothing. Nothing.

280
00:14:38.295 --> 00:14:39.838
I opened my mouth
and no words came out.

281
00:14:39.921 --> 00:14:41.464
-Actually. Legend. did you...
-No. no. no. Nope.

282
00:14:41.548 --> 00:14:43.550
I heard you. You said
I'm a really good dad.

283
00:14:43.717 --> 00:14:45.510
Pretty good. Pretty good.

284
00:14:45.594 --> 00:14:49.306
My son thinks I'm an amazing dad!

285
00:14:58.857 --> 00:15:00.317
Ha-ha! Whoo!

286
00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:03.069
Ooh!

287
00:15:07.365 --> 00:15:08.908
-I'm right here.
-

288
00:15:15.624 --> 00:15:16.625
Mmm.

289
00:15:38.647 --> 00:15:39.981
-What?

290
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:45.612
Whoa! What kind of airship is that?

291
00:15:45.779 --> 00:15:48.114
I don't know. I've never seen
anything like it.

292
00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.075
Hey. hey. What are you doing?

293
00:15:50.241 --> 00:15:52.077
No. you're damaging our crops!

294
00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:02.671
Baby Clade. hey.

295
00:16:02.754 --> 00:16:04.923
Oh. how long has it been?

296
00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:06.633
-Callisto?
-You know her?

297
00:16:06.716 --> 00:16:08.385
Yeah. She used to work with my dad.

298
00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:10.929
What is the leader of Avalonia
doing in our front yard?

299
00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:13.223
-I don't know.
-Aw. get in here.

300
00:16:13.390 --> 00:16:15.100
-So good to see you. man.
-

301
00:16:15.266 --> 00:16:16.267
-Ugh!
-You too.

302
00:16:16.351 --> 00:16:18.144
-You must be Meridian.
-Oh. Yes.

303
00:16:18.228 --> 00:16:20.063
-So lovely to meet you.
-Great meeting you.

304
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.523
-And Ethan.
-

305
00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:23.024
The future of Clade Farms.

306
00:16:23.108 --> 00:16:25.276
Oh. your dad must be so proud.

307
00:16:26.945 --> 00:16:29.280
Oh. hey. is it okay if we park
the Venture here?

308
00:16:29.447 --> 00:16:31.408
You know. I can tell my pilot to move it.

309
00:16:31.574 --> 00:16:32.617
It's not a big deal.

310
00:16:32.701 --> 00:16:34.369
I mean. it is a big deal.
but it's not a big deal.

311
00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:35.745
No. it's... it's fine.

312
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:37.580
Uh. can the Venture fly
over the mountains?

313
00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:40.291
Well. sorry.
Nothing can fly that high.

314
00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:42.252
Well. not yet anyways.

315
00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:43.586
But that's not why I'm here.

316
00:16:43.878 --> 00:16:45.714
Uh. why are you here?

317
00:16:46.214 --> 00:16:47.882
There's something I need to show you.

318
00:16:48.967 --> 00:16:50.802
Where did you find these?

319
00:16:50.885 --> 00:16:53.012
It started in the northeast territory.

320
00:16:53.179 --> 00:16:55.807
and it's been spreading
like wildfire ever since.

321
00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:58.518
According to our estimates.
every crop will be infected

322
00:16:58.601 --> 00:16:59.894
within a month.

323
00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:01.229
Including your farm.

324
00:17:02.397 --> 00:17:05.191
Searcher. I'm mounting
an expedition to save Pando.

325
00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:07.152
and I want you to come with me.

326
00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:09.863
Callisto. I don't go on expeditions.

327
00:17:09.946 --> 00:17:11.072
I'm not my father.

328
00:17:11.156 --> 00:17:14.409
Yeah. He didn't come back. you did.

329
00:17:14.576 --> 00:17:16.536
And you brought back a miracle.

330
00:17:17.120 --> 00:17:18.705
And now there's something
wrong with it.

331
00:17:27.130 --> 00:17:28.590
Look at how they glow out there.

332
00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:32.302
It's like a heartbeat. isn't it?

333
00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:34.512
Searcher.

334
00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:37.056
I was there when you found Pando.

335
00:17:38.516 --> 00:17:40.018
Look what it's given us.

336
00:17:40.769 --> 00:17:43.396
Airships. the lights in our homes.

337
00:17:43.813 --> 00:17:45.315
But most importantly.

338
00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:48.485
it showed us our future
wasn't out there somewhere.

339
00:17:48.651 --> 00:17:49.652
but here.

340
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.906
Pando's dying. Searcher.

341
00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:54.073
You and I.

342
00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:56.576
we have an obligation to save it.

343
00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.708
-

344
00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:10.215
Okay.

345
00:18:10.298 --> 00:18:11.800
Yes. When do we head out?

346
00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:14.135
Whoa. whoa. Hold up.
You're not coming with me.

347
00:18:14.302 --> 00:18:15.637
But we do everything together.

348
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.721
Not this.

349
00:18:16.805 --> 00:18:17.806
Then what's the point
of you showing me

350
00:18:17.889 --> 00:18:19.224
how to grow Pando my whole life?

351
00:18:19.307 --> 00:18:20.725
So you can take over the farm.

352
00:18:20.809 --> 00:18:22.393
But this is so much more important.

353
00:18:22.477 --> 00:18:23.686
-No.
-But. Dad.

354
00:18:23.770 --> 00:18:25.438
I will not risk your life.

355
00:18:25.605 --> 00:18:27.565
Not now. not ever.

356
00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:31.444
-Ethan.
-

357
00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:32.529
Ethan.

358
00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:33.780
-

359
00:18:33.863 --> 00:18:35.907
-Unfortunately. Searcher.

360
00:18:36.074 --> 00:18:39.410
every second we delay
puts Avalonia in grave danger.

361
00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:42.831
Let me go get my things.

362
00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:37.677
WOMAN: All right. everyone.

363
00:19:37.844 --> 00:19:40.054
President Mal is about to give
us our mission parameters.

364
00:19:40.138 --> 00:19:42.390
Uh. Mr. Clade. my name's Caspian.

365
00:19:42.473 --> 00:19:44.183
-I'm a huge fan...
-Oh. thank you.

366
00:19:44.267 --> 00:19:45.643
-...of your dad.
-

367
00:19:45.727 --> 00:19:47.520
Do you think you could forge
his autograph?

368
00:19:47.604 --> 00:19:48.605
-What?
-WOMAN: Listen up.

369
00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:50.023
Thank you. Captain Pulk.

370
00:19:50.189 --> 00:19:52.191
Though Pando seems
to be thousands of plants

371
00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:53.735
here on the surface.

372
00:19:53.818 --> 00:19:56.821
underground. it is actually
a singular organism

373
00:19:56.988 --> 00:19:59.032
with an inter-connected root system.

374
00:19:59.616 --> 00:20:01.659
We believe whatever's making Pando sick

375
00:20:01.826 --> 00:20:04.954
is attacking it deep within
this system at its heart.

376
00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:06.831
Three weeks ago.
Captain Pulk here

377
00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:08.875
tracked the roots out to the Atlas Range.

378
00:20:09.042 --> 00:20:11.210
where they suddenly took a turn downward.

379
00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:13.421
They started excavating.

380
00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:14.547
but the ground gave out.

381
00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:17.175
revealing an even bigger mystery.

382
00:20:19.761 --> 00:20:21.930
Our mission is to follow these roots

383
00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:23.932
until we reach the heart of Pando

384
00:20:24.015 --> 00:20:25.892
and stop whatever's harming it.

385
00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:28.019
So. how far does it go down?

386
00:20:28.102 --> 00:20:29.395
We're not sure.

387
00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:32.565
But Avalonia's future
depends on us finding out.

388
00:20:33.024 --> 00:20:35.068
Psst. Clade. come here. listen.

389
00:20:35.234 --> 00:20:37.904
We. uh... We got no idea
what's down there.

390
00:20:38.071 --> 00:20:40.740
If you wanna back out.
I could drop you off.

391
00:20:40.823 --> 00:20:41.908
Wait. seriously?

392
00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:44.577
No. I'm just messin' with you.

393
00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:47.080
Look at your face. Oh!

394
00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:48.498
We need you to figure this out.

395
00:20:48.581 --> 00:20:49.582
otherwise. we're doomed.

396
00:20:51.668 --> 00:20:52.710
Lieutenant Duffle.

397
00:20:52.877 --> 00:20:55.588
can you please earn your paycheck
and fly us down?

398
00:20:56.798 --> 00:20:57.799
Yes. Captain Pulk.

399
00:21:23.032 --> 00:21:24.075
Hmm?

400
00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:35.503
Whoa.

401
00:21:37.547 --> 00:21:38.756
Whew.

402
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:43.511
Whoa.

403
00:21:55.732 --> 00:21:58.651
Whoa. Wow. It's beautiful.

404
00:22:00.028 --> 00:22:03.281
Oh. I wish everyone
in Avalonia could see this.

405
00:22:03.364 --> 00:22:04.365
Searcher!

406
00:22:05.616 --> 00:22:06.617
What is that?

407
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:08.244
Whatever it is.
it knows your name.

408
00:22:08.327 --> 00:22:09.495
-WOMAN: Searcher!
-

409
00:22:09.787 --> 00:22:10.872
Searcher!

410
00:22:10.955 --> 00:22:13.166
What? Meridian?
What are you doin' down here?

411
00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:15.418
I've been trying to flag you down
for the last four hours.

412
00:22:15.585 --> 00:22:18.838
Our son is on your ship.

413
00:22:19.005 --> 00:22:20.631
What did she just say?
Honey. what are you saying?

414
00:22:20.715 --> 00:22:21.716
What is she saying?

415
00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:23.718
She said your son is on our ship.

416
00:22:23.801 --> 00:22:24.927
-Hey. Mom.
-Ethan?

417
00:22:25.094 --> 00:22:26.095
Oh. hey. Dad.

418
00:22:26.179 --> 00:22:28.181
You brought the dog?

419
00:22:28.347 --> 00:22:29.515
What...
What are you doing here?

420
00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:30.850
Look. Dad. I just wanna help.

421
00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:33.102
Ethan. we talked about this. I can't.

422
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:35.313
I need you to take care
of the farm while I'm gone.

423
00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:37.315
Now. please. go home with Mom.

424
00:22:37.398 --> 00:22:38.441
Wait. but. Dad.

425
00:22:41.194 --> 00:22:42.779
-

426
00:22:45.656 --> 00:22:46.699
What is happening?

427
00:22:46.866 --> 00:22:48.451
ETHAN: Dad.
what are those things?

428
00:22:48.618 --> 00:22:50.661
Head inside. I got this.

429
00:22:50.745 --> 00:22:51.788
-

430
00:22:54.332 --> 00:22:56.375
-

431
00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:04.675
-

432
00:23:07.637 --> 00:23:10.389
Hey. razor face.
Yeah. come and get me.

433
00:23:10.473 --> 00:23:11.682
Oh. no.

434
00:23:14.143 --> 00:23:15.436
Duffle. get us out of here.

435
00:23:24.737 --> 00:23:26.531
-

436
00:23:41.254 --> 00:23:42.255
Hold on!

437
00:23:43.131 --> 00:23:44.465
-Legend!
-

438
00:23:46.634 --> 00:23:47.885
Oh. Whoa!

439
00:24:26.632 --> 00:24:27.800
Brace yourself.

440
00:24:29.886 --> 00:24:32.013
-Dad!

441
00:24:38.477 --> 00:24:40.313
-Dad!
-Ethan!

442
00:24:45.318 --> 00:24:47.320
-We're comin' in too hot.
-I know.

443
00:24:53.743 --> 00:24:55.995
Come on. Venture. Hang in there.

444
00:24:59.790 --> 00:25:01.292
-

445
00:25:07.673 --> 00:25:08.716
Not today.

446
00:25:30.613 --> 00:25:34.408
Did you have any idea
all of this was down here?

447
00:25:35.952 --> 00:25:36.953
Not at all.

448
00:25:37.912 --> 00:25:39.997
We are definitely off the map now.

449
00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:44.835
Okay. they're okay.

450
00:25:45.002 --> 00:25:46.337
And we're okay.

451
00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.588
-

452
00:25:47.672 --> 00:25:50.424
Oh. yes. yes.
Look. I know. I'm happy too.

453
00:25:50.508 --> 00:25:52.009
Easy on the tongue.

454
00:25:52.093 --> 00:25:53.803
-Easy on the tongue. Easy.
-

455
00:26:04.313 --> 00:26:06.065
Whoa. Wow.

456
00:26:30.506 --> 00:26:32.300
This place is amazing.

457
00:26:32.383 --> 00:26:33.551
-

458
00:26:33.634 --> 00:26:36.637
No. Hey. Legend. Legend.
Leave it. leave it.

459
00:26:36.804 --> 00:26:39.181
Hey. hey. we have no idea
what that is.

460
00:26:39.348 --> 00:26:40.599
Get that out of your mouth.

461
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:43.311
All right. boy.

462
00:26:43.394 --> 00:26:44.520
Phew.

463
00:26:44.603 --> 00:26:46.147
Let's get back to our family.

464
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:47.481
-What?
-

465
00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:51.152
What in the...?

466
00:26:51.235 --> 00:26:52.278
Yuck.

467
00:26:52.361 --> 00:26:54.071
-

468
00:26:54.155 --> 00:26:56.365
-Hey. Legend. get back here.

469
00:26:58.326 --> 00:26:59.327
Whoa!

470
00:27:26.604 --> 00:27:28.064
Hi. uh. hello.

471
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:31.984
I'm a human being from the top world.

472
00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:35.404
You probably don't understand
a word I'm saying. do you?

473
00:27:35.905 --> 00:27:38.115
Pfft! Of course I understand you.

474
00:27:38.199 --> 00:27:39.200
What do you think I am.

475
00:27:39.283 --> 00:27:40.493
one of those mindless monsters?

476
00:27:40.868 --> 00:27:42.370
-Huh?
-That's right. bub.

477
00:27:42.453 --> 00:27:47.166
You're in the presence
of the one. the only Jaeger...

478
00:27:47.249 --> 00:27:48.250
Dad?

479
00:27:48.793 --> 00:27:49.794
Dad?

480
00:27:55.383 --> 00:27:56.384
CALLISTO: Okay. everyone.

481
00:27:57.009 --> 00:27:59.804
We are clearly in uncharted territory.

482
00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:03.015
I know you're all
feeling scared. I am too.

483
00:28:03.099 --> 00:28:05.059
But the mission remains the same.

484
00:28:05.142 --> 00:28:07.395
We're here to save Pando. okay?

485
00:28:07.561 --> 00:28:09.063
But before we can do that.

486
00:28:09.146 --> 00:28:11.065
we need to get our ship
back into the air.

487
00:28:11.148 --> 00:28:12.274
What about my dad?

488
00:28:12.358 --> 00:28:13.651
Shouldn't we be saving him first?

489
00:28:13.734 --> 00:28:15.986
He's a farmer. You can't
just leave him out there.

490
00:28:16.529 --> 00:28:18.656
No one's leaving anyone.

491
00:28:18.823 --> 00:28:20.408
I know you're worried
about your dad.

492
00:28:20.574 --> 00:28:23.244
but I've seen him
out in the field firsthand.

493
00:28:23.411 --> 00:28:25.121
He knows how to survive.

494
00:28:25.204 --> 00:28:26.288
If we want to do the same.

495
00:28:26.372 --> 00:28:28.541
our best bet is to retrieve him by air.

496
00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:31.460
Which means fixing this ship
is the priority.

497
00:28:31.544 --> 00:28:33.045
But that's gonna take way too long.

498
00:28:33.212 --> 00:28:34.713
-She's right. Ethan.
-What?

499
00:28:34.797 --> 00:28:35.881
No. I know. I know.

500
00:28:35.965 --> 00:28:37.925
But. babe. we have no idea
what's out here.

501
00:28:38.092 --> 00:28:39.510
The Venture is our safest option.

502
00:28:39.677 --> 00:28:40.678
-But. Mom.
-Honey.

503
00:28:40.761 --> 00:28:42.346
why don't you go hang out
in the cockpit

504
00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:43.472
while I help them with repairs?

505
00:28:43.973 --> 00:28:46.809
I promise you. Ethan.
we're gonna save your dad.

506
00:28:50.146 --> 00:28:51.147
Thanks for the backup.

507
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:52.648
I'm gonna hold you to that promise.

508
00:28:52.815 --> 00:28:54.608
You have your assignments. get moving.

509
00:28:54.775 --> 00:28:56.527
Caspian. can you keep
an eye on Ethan?

510
00:28:56.694 --> 00:28:59.113
Come on. Ethan. We're gonna
have the best time.

511
00:28:59.196 --> 00:29:00.531
You like board games. right?

512
00:29:00.614 --> 00:29:01.949
We have the best games.

513
00:29:02.116 --> 00:29:05.369
Rung and Rafters.
Candy Jams. Battletrip.

514
00:29:05.703 --> 00:29:08.330
Nope. no. No. no. Mm-mm.
You're not my son.

515
00:29:08.414 --> 00:29:09.665
What?
What are you talking about?

516
00:29:09.832 --> 00:29:12.209
You're probably
just some oddly-shaped rock

517
00:29:12.293 --> 00:29:14.753
that my eyes
want to believe is a person.

518
00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:17.339
I am not an oddly-shaped rock.

519
00:29:17.506 --> 00:29:20.176
That's exactly what
an oddly-shaped rock would say.

520
00:29:20.342 --> 00:29:21.635
Wow. okay.

521
00:29:21.719 --> 00:29:24.054
Well. would
an oddly-shaped rock know

522
00:29:24.221 --> 00:29:26.390
that you gave me a machete
for my birthday?

523
00:29:28.392 --> 00:29:30.227
Classic. Jaeger Clade.

524
00:29:30.394 --> 00:29:32.396
-I was two.
-Hmm.

525
00:29:33.647 --> 00:29:34.815
I'm real. Dad.

526
00:29:35.357 --> 00:29:36.609
It's really me.

527
00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:40.446
Your son. Searcher.

528
00:29:48.704 --> 00:29:49.997
Searcher?

529
00:29:52.458 --> 00:29:55.377
This is incredible.

530
00:29:55.461 --> 00:29:57.546
-I was thinkin' the same.
-Hmm.

531
00:29:57.630 --> 00:30:00.132
-

532
00:30:03.219 --> 00:30:05.346
Oh. that means that flying machine

533
00:30:05.429 --> 00:30:08.224
that crashed is also real?

534
00:30:08.307 --> 00:30:09.558
Yeah.

535
00:30:09.642 --> 00:30:12.645
Well. let's get moving.
We've got no time to lose.

536
00:30:12.728 --> 00:30:13.812
Whoa. wait.

537
00:30:15.022 --> 00:30:16.607
Whoa. whoa. whoa. wait. hey!

538
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:18.400
Will you get that off your head?

539
00:30:19.652 --> 00:30:21.111
-Ugh!

540
00:30:23.948 --> 00:30:24.990
There you go.

541
00:30:25.324 --> 00:30:27.743
It's not pretty. but. uh.
it'll get us back airborne.

542
00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:29.620
I gotta say. Meridian.

543
00:30:29.787 --> 00:30:32.957
for a crop duster.
you are one gutsy pilot.

544
00:30:33.374 --> 00:30:34.833
Well. the three things
I love the most

545
00:30:34.917 --> 00:30:37.962
are my family. my farm.
and flying.

546
00:30:38.128 --> 00:30:40.756
Now if that last thing
could protect the other two.

547
00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:42.883
I'd fly through fire.

548
00:30:44.552 --> 00:30:46.720
-Um. Mrs. Clade?
-Yeah. what's up?

549
00:30:46.804 --> 00:30:49.181
Remember how I was given
the crucial responsibility

550
00:30:49.265 --> 00:30:50.307
of watching your son?

551
00:30:50.391 --> 00:30:51.600
Is he givin' you trouble?

552
00:30:51.767 --> 00:30:53.686
Just send him back to me.
I'll put him to work.

553
00:30:53.769 --> 00:30:56.146
Oh. I would love to do that.

554
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:58.357
Except. I don't know where he is.

555
00:30:58.524 --> 00:30:59.608
BOTH: What?

556
00:30:59.775 --> 00:31:02.152
ETHAN: Dad! Dad! Whoa!

557
00:31:03.988 --> 00:31:05.739
Uh... Oh!

558
00:31:05.823 --> 00:31:08.242
This is way faster than our tractor.

559
00:31:08.325 --> 00:31:10.077
I gotta get me one of these.

560
00:31:16.834 --> 00:31:18.252
Whoa.

561
00:31:40.858 --> 00:31:42.026
Whoa.

562
00:31:42.359 --> 00:31:43.861
Huh.

563
00:31:43.944 --> 00:31:45.904
A vast. undiscovered wilderness

564
00:31:45.988 --> 00:31:48.616
filled with fantastic creatures.

565
00:31:50.868 --> 00:31:52.578
This is just like Primal Outpost.

566
00:31:56.415 --> 00:31:58.292
-

567
00:32:12.222 --> 00:32:15.809
Okay. this is nothing
like Primal Outpost.

568
00:32:50.761 --> 00:32:51.887
You can do this. Ethan.

569
00:32:52.513 --> 00:32:53.555
Just be brave.

570
00:32:54.181 --> 00:32:55.307
It's in your blood.

571
00:33:12.825 --> 00:33:13.826
I'm alive.

572
00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:20.290
Oh. hey. Diazo.

573
00:33:20.374 --> 00:33:21.667
How was my weekend? Pfft.

574
00:33:21.750 --> 00:33:22.751
What did I do?

575
00:33:22.835 --> 00:33:24.878
Oh. yeah. I just ran through
a nightmare tunnel

576
00:33:24.962 --> 00:33:26.797
to rescue my dad.

577
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.590
No big deal. Yeah.

578
00:33:28.674 --> 00:33:30.175
-

579
00:33:31.093 --> 00:33:33.220
-Hello?

580
00:33:45.023 --> 00:33:47.025
-

581
00:33:47.776 --> 00:33:49.153
-

582
00:33:51.321 --> 00:33:53.532
-

583
00:34:02.249 --> 00:34:04.626
-

584
00:34:04.793 --> 00:34:05.794
What?

585
00:34:07.838 --> 00:34:11.884
That is so weird.
but also kinda cool.

586
00:34:12.551 --> 00:34:13.552
Hey.

587
00:34:13.635 --> 00:34:15.637
-Hey. buddy.

588
00:34:16.221 --> 00:34:18.015
-Hey. it's okay. It's okay.

589
00:34:18.182 --> 00:34:19.433
I'm friendly. see?

590
00:34:20.350 --> 00:34:22.352
-I'm a friend.

591
00:34:22.686 --> 00:34:24.021
See? We're all friends.

592
00:34:30.569 --> 00:34:31.779
-ETHAN: Aah!

593
00:34:32.321 --> 00:34:33.363
Ow!

594
00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:35.491
-Okay.

595
00:34:36.241 --> 00:34:38.160
Yeah. I guess I deserved that.

596
00:34:38.327 --> 00:34:39.703
I did splat you into a wall.

597
00:34:44.583 --> 00:34:46.668
-Hey. that's my dad's.

598
00:34:46.752 --> 00:34:47.961
Where'd you get that?

599
00:34:50.088 --> 00:34:51.757
What? Can you bring me to him?

600
00:34:54.676 --> 00:34:56.011
I'm so lucky I ran into you.

601
00:34:56.178 --> 00:34:57.888
By the way.
you're not dangerous. right?

602
00:34:58.055 --> 00:35:00.599
I mean. you don't look dangerous.
I just. you know...

603
00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:08.732
Quickest route
to your flying machine

604
00:35:08.816 --> 00:35:10.776
is through that valley up ahead.

605
00:35:10.859 --> 00:35:12.194
Okay. I have so many questions.

606
00:35:12.277 --> 00:35:13.862
-Like. for one...

607
00:35:14.071 --> 00:35:15.447
what is this place?

608
00:35:15.614 --> 00:35:17.199
JAEGER: A subterranean labyrinth

609
00:35:17.366 --> 00:35:19.535
where everything's alive.

610
00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:21.912
And most things. well.
they want to eat ya.

611
00:35:22.287 --> 00:35:24.081
Uh. you mean like this thing?

612
00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:26.458
JAEGER: Nah. that's harmless.

613
00:35:27.334 --> 00:35:28.544
And... And these things?

614
00:35:28.627 --> 00:35:30.087
Funny little goobers. aren't they?

615
00:35:30.337 --> 00:35:33.423
-Every time I blaze a trail.

616
00:35:33.590 --> 00:35:35.008
they un-blaze it.

617
00:35:37.261 --> 00:35:38.720
-SEARCHER: Right.
-

618
00:35:38.804 --> 00:35:41.473
Um. so. how did you
even end up down here?

619
00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:44.768
Through ingenuity and sheer tenacity.

620
00:35:45.811 --> 00:35:47.980
After months of battling the elements.

621
00:35:48.146 --> 00:35:51.859
I figured there was no way
anyone could ever survive

622
00:35:52.025 --> 00:35:54.069
walking over those cold.
deadly peaks.

623
00:35:55.237 --> 00:35:58.907
So. I went searching for a new path.

624
00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:01.535
-The ground gave out.
-

625
00:36:01.994 --> 00:36:04.162
-And I found this place.
-

626
00:36:04.246 --> 00:36:05.247
SEARCHER: Oh.
so you're stuck down here.

627
00:36:06.248 --> 00:36:08.000
I. um... I...

628
00:36:08.083 --> 00:36:10.377
I wouldn't put it that way.

629
00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.005
So. I found this place.

630
00:36:13.088 --> 00:36:14.548
-And it occurred to me.

631
00:36:14.631 --> 00:36:16.758
instead of going over these mountains.

632
00:36:17.259 --> 00:36:19.428
I'll go under them.

633
00:36:20.262 --> 00:36:23.432
Even if I had to fight
every monster down here.

634
00:36:23.599 --> 00:36:25.809
Nothing was gonna stop Jaeger Clade

635
00:36:25.976 --> 00:36:28.228
from fulfilling his destiny.

636
00:36:29.229 --> 00:36:31.523
That is. until I came upon

637
00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.026
the Burning Sea.

638
00:36:34.693 --> 00:36:36.987
A place where the cliffs are alive

639
00:36:37.154 --> 00:36:40.324
and the waters will dissolve
the flesh off your bones.

640
00:36:41.408 --> 00:36:44.578
But now. with that
flying machine of yours.

641
00:36:44.661 --> 00:36:46.663
we got a way to fly right past it

642
00:36:46.747 --> 00:36:49.166
and onto the other side
of the mountains.

643
00:36:49.249 --> 00:36:53.462
Wait. You literally discovered
a world beneath our world.

644
00:36:53.629 --> 00:36:54.755
and that's not enough?

645
00:36:54.838 --> 00:36:58.967
This discovery may be fine
for some second-class explorers.

646
00:36:59.051 --> 00:37:00.928
but not for us Clades.

647
00:37:01.094 --> 00:37:03.221
Whoa. there.
This Clade is not an explorer.

648
00:37:03.388 --> 00:37:04.765
This Clade is a farmer.

649
00:37:04.932 --> 00:37:07.476
A farmer? Ugh!

650
00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:10.687
Your mom has a lot
of explaining to do.

651
00:37:10.771 --> 00:37:12.105
She's gone. Dad.

652
00:37:12.689 --> 00:37:15.901
Penelope's dead?

653
00:37:16.151 --> 00:37:17.903
Dead? No. she's not dead.

654
00:37:18.070 --> 00:37:19.863
She's 60 and works out
five days a week.

655
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:21.281
I said she was gone.

656
00:37:21.448 --> 00:37:24.326
As in. moved on with Sheldon.

657
00:37:25.494 --> 00:37:26.954
Twenty-five years. Dad.

658
00:37:27.496 --> 00:37:29.665
We thought you were dead
for 25 years.

659
00:37:30.707 --> 00:37:32.626
What did you think
was gonna happen?

660
00:37:36.338 --> 00:37:37.673
-No! What? Aah!

661
00:37:37.756 --> 00:37:39.841
I am going to kill Sheldon!

662
00:37:39.925 --> 00:37:41.551
-What?
-I've always hated him.

663
00:37:41.635 --> 00:37:43.220
-You've never met him.
-I hate his name.

664
00:37:43.387 --> 00:37:45.639
And I'll probably hate
his face.

665
00:37:45.722 --> 00:37:47.349
Yep. he's takin' this really well.

666
00:37:48.934 --> 00:37:50.143
Uh. we should go.

667
00:37:50.227 --> 00:37:51.228
-

668
00:38:00.237 --> 00:38:01.822
-

669
00:38:30.517 --> 00:38:32.936
This place is so crazy.

670
00:38:34.062 --> 00:38:35.397
Who knew that
this was all down here?

671
00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.190
I mean. you knew
this was down here

672
00:38:37.274 --> 00:38:38.734
because you're from here.

673
00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:40.360
but it's not like this up top.

674
00:38:40.527 --> 00:38:43.030
Like. these colors.
these colors are so trippy.

675
00:38:43.113 --> 00:38:44.948
And these trees. ugh!

676
00:38:45.032 --> 00:38:47.284
Even the trees are cool.

677
00:38:47.367 --> 00:38:48.744
Why is it doing that. Splat?

678
00:38:49.327 --> 00:38:50.370
Oh. by the way.

679
00:38:50.829 --> 00:38:52.581
do you mind if I call you Splat?

680
00:38:52.664 --> 00:38:53.665
I just came up with it.

681
00:38:53.749 --> 00:38:55.083
You just kinda give me Splat vibes.

682
00:38:55.167 --> 00:38:56.626
-so I just thought...
-

683
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:57.919
Oh.

684
00:38:58.003 --> 00:38:59.921
Wait. are you offended? I can't tell.

685
00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.174
You know what? I'll just follow you.

686
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:33.747
Searcher. you call that climbing?

687
00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:35.248
I'm a 40-year-old man that farms.

688
00:39:35.332 --> 00:39:37.292
Climbing isn't really
part of my day-to-day.

689
00:39:37.459 --> 00:39:39.211
So. you just forgot

690
00:39:39.669 --> 00:39:41.171
everything I taught you?

691
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:44.674
No. just the pointless explorer stuff.

692
00:39:44.841 --> 00:39:46.134
So. yeah. everything.

693
00:39:47.302 --> 00:39:48.970
JAEGER: Well. scoff all you want.

694
00:39:49.137 --> 00:39:50.847
But. when I get past these mountains.

695
00:39:51.014 --> 00:39:53.433
I'll return to Avalonia a hero.

696
00:39:54.101 --> 00:39:56.978
Bet they even give me a statue
in the town square.

697
00:39:57.145 --> 00:39:58.480
You already have a statue.

698
00:39:58.730 --> 00:39:59.731
I do?

699
00:39:59.815 --> 00:40:01.525
Yeah. and it's right beside mine.

700
00:40:04.736 --> 00:40:07.197
You have a statue?

701
00:40:07.364 --> 00:40:08.865
What. do they just give statues

702
00:40:08.949 --> 00:40:10.283
to everybody these days?

703
00:40:10.367 --> 00:40:11.993
No. Dad. I discovered Pando.

704
00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.329
You know. the thing
I'm actually down here to save.

705
00:40:14.496 --> 00:40:15.997
The discovery that actually
changed the world

706
00:40:16.164 --> 00:40:19.292
and transformed Avalonia
into the utopia that it is today.

707
00:40:19.459 --> 00:40:21.545
And not that it matters.
but my statue's taller.

708
00:40:21.628 --> 00:40:23.296
-Oh. here you go. little guy.

709
00:40:24.464 --> 00:40:28.552
Oh. well. so much for the
whole humble farmer bit. huh?

710
00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.596
Maybe you're more like me
than you want to admit.

711
00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:34.891
I am nothing like you.

712
00:40:34.975 --> 00:40:37.310
Uh-huh. Just keep
tellin' yourself that.

713
00:40:37.811 --> 00:40:38.854
Whatever.

714
00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.648
I created a real legacy when...

715
00:40:41.731 --> 00:40:42.732
-Whoa. whoa!
-

716
00:40:42.816 --> 00:40:44.776
Hey. there.
Uh. is this thing dangerous?

717
00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.778
-Maybe.
-

718
00:40:46.862 --> 00:40:48.155
SEARCHER: Oh. no. no. no.

719
00:40:48.238 --> 00:40:49.531
-

720
00:40:55.078 --> 00:40:56.371
Hold it.

721
00:40:58.915 --> 00:40:59.958
Hmm.

722
00:41:01.501 --> 00:41:03.128
There's someone else out here.

723
00:41:03.587 --> 00:41:05.505
That's Ethan's.
That's Ethan's.

724
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:06.590
What?

725
00:41:07.174 --> 00:41:10.302
I said. that's Ethan's.

726
00:41:10.468 --> 00:41:11.845
-Who's Ethan?
-My son.

727
00:41:11.928 --> 00:41:13.180
Your son?

728
00:41:13.346 --> 00:41:16.141
Jaeger Clade is a grandpa?

729
00:41:16.224 --> 00:41:18.518
Ugh. I guess. technically. yes.

730
00:41:19.019 --> 00:41:20.020
JAEGER: Hmm.

731
00:41:20.562 --> 00:41:22.272
Well. he's not alone.

732
00:41:22.355 --> 00:41:24.065
-

733
00:41:24.149 --> 00:41:26.735
-SEARCHER: He's with a what?
-A scout for the Reapers.

734
00:41:26.818 --> 00:41:28.195
They only got one job.

735
00:41:28.361 --> 00:41:29.738
to lure you to your death.

736
00:41:29.905 --> 00:41:31.865
What? Can this thing move faster?

737
00:41:31.948 --> 00:41:33.617
-Hyah!
-

738
00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:39.956
Whoa.

739
00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:41.291
What is this thing?

740
00:41:42.125 --> 00:41:44.461
Hey. we're still looking
for my dad. right?

741
00:41:50.884 --> 00:41:52.886
-

742
00:41:54.804 --> 00:41:56.848
-

743
00:42:10.403 --> 00:42:12.364
-Yeah. yeah. I know. I know.

744
00:42:12.447 --> 00:42:13.782
But this Pando fell off the Venture

745
00:42:13.865 --> 00:42:15.533
and we don't waste pods. so...

746
00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.160
I'm just gonna grab it
really quick. okay?

747
00:42:17.244 --> 00:42:18.328
-Hang on. hang on.

748
00:42:18.411 --> 00:42:19.788
Really quick. Just let me
grab the rest of these.

749
00:42:20.747 --> 00:42:22.374
-

750
00:42:22.457 --> 00:42:23.458
Splat?

751
00:42:24.125 --> 00:42:25.126
Splat!

752
00:42:31.967 --> 00:42:33.134
Here. it's okay.

753
00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:34.719
I can help you with that.

754
00:42:35.303 --> 00:42:36.304
Let me see.

755
00:42:38.098 --> 00:42:39.432
You can trust me.

756
00:42:49.859 --> 00:42:51.486
- Here. here.

757
00:42:51.569 --> 00:42:53.071
It's okay. it's okay.

758
00:42:59.411 --> 00:43:01.121
And there you go.

759
00:43:02.372 --> 00:43:04.457
-Good as new.

760
00:43:06.376 --> 00:43:08.420
-

761
00:43:09.087 --> 00:43:10.630
Are these friends of yours?

762
00:43:10.714 --> 00:43:13.258
-Uh. hi. I'm Ethan.

763
00:43:13.341 --> 00:43:16.177
I thought Splat here
was bringing me to my dad.

764
00:43:16.261 --> 00:43:18.555
Uh. maybe I was wrong.

765
00:43:18.638 --> 00:43:20.015
-Don't see my dad anywhere.

766
00:43:21.725 --> 00:43:23.310
I'll just be on my way. Whoa!

767
00:43:23.393 --> 00:43:24.602
-Uh...
-

768
00:43:28.898 --> 00:43:31.318
-

769
00:43:35.822 --> 00:43:36.823
Whoa.

770
00:43:36.906 --> 00:43:38.116
-Oh. Ethan!
-Dad.

771
00:43:38.283 --> 00:43:39.326
Stay behind me.

772
00:43:39.409 --> 00:43:41.369
-Who's he?
-Ethan. meet your grandpa.

773
00:43:41.536 --> 00:43:42.620
That's Jaeger Clade?

774
00:43:42.787 --> 00:43:44.080
The one and only.

775
00:43:44.914 --> 00:43:46.916
-Follow me.

776
00:43:51.629 --> 00:43:52.964
ETHAN: Ahh!
SEARCHER: Whoa!

777
00:43:53.673 --> 00:43:54.674
Now what?

778
00:43:54.758 --> 00:43:56.760
-Jump!
-

779
00:44:02.265 --> 00:44:03.683
ETHAN: Whoa!

780
00:44:03.767 --> 00:44:04.851
What are these things?

781
00:44:04.934 --> 00:44:06.102
Our ticket out of here.

782
00:44:10.065 --> 00:44:11.358
SEARCHER: They're not
gonna eat us. right?

783
00:44:11.441 --> 00:44:13.234
-No. but they will.
-What?

784
00:44:13.318 --> 00:44:14.736
-Just run.
- Whoa!

785
00:44:23.453 --> 00:44:24.954
-ETHAN: Dad!

786
00:44:28.416 --> 00:44:30.835
Come on. Searcher.
Stop embarrassing me out here.

787
00:44:32.379 --> 00:44:33.463
He's awesome.

788
00:44:33.546 --> 00:44:34.714
He is not awesome.

789
00:44:34.798 --> 00:44:35.924
He just saved my life.

790
00:44:36.007 --> 00:44:37.717
You know. I was a part
of that rescue too.

791
00:44:37.884 --> 00:44:39.094
He just saved your life.

792
00:44:39.177 --> 00:44:41.679
You ain't seen
nothing yet. kid.

793
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:43.348
-

794
00:44:47.310 --> 00:44:49.354
-No. Ethan.

795
00:44:51.147 --> 00:44:52.357
ETHAN: Splat.

796
00:44:55.443 --> 00:44:56.736
Whoa!

797
00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:57.821
Thanks. buddy.

798
00:44:57.904 --> 00:44:59.531
-Are you okay?
-

799
00:44:59.614 --> 00:45:00.907
I'm talkin' to my son.

800
00:45:00.990 --> 00:45:02.242
-I'm fine. Dad.
-JAEGER: Whoo!

801
00:45:02.325 --> 00:45:03.493
Can you not show off

802
00:45:03.576 --> 00:45:05.745
while we are running for our lives?

803
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:07.414
Ha. calm down. The kid's all right.

804
00:45:09.582 --> 00:45:11.000
How are you my dad?

805
00:45:11.084 --> 00:45:12.585
Oh. you want to have
that conversation?

806
00:45:12.669 --> 00:45:14.254
Well. when two people
love each other...

807
00:45:14.337 --> 00:45:15.755
SEARCHER: Don't!
Stop talking. stop talking.

808
00:45:15.839 --> 00:45:17.549
Stop talking.
stop talking. stop talking.

809
00:45:26.141 --> 00:45:28.059
Time for a barbeque.

810
00:45:30.103 --> 00:45:31.813
-That ain't good.
-

811
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:34.691
MERIDIAN: Heads up.

812
00:45:35.316 --> 00:45:36.568
Get on.

813
00:45:36.651 --> 00:45:37.777
-Meridian.
-Mom.

814
00:45:37.861 --> 00:45:39.571
Oh. no. no. no.
Don't you "Mom" me.

815
00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:41.990
Once we get home.
your butt is grounded for life.

816
00:45:42.073 --> 00:45:43.283
-Ooh. I like her.
-Who's he?

817
00:45:43.366 --> 00:45:44.534
-My dad.
-What?

818
00:45:44.617 --> 00:45:46.119
Hurry up. Go. go. go.

819
00:45:59.007 --> 00:46:00.425
A wall of monsters.

820
00:46:00.925 --> 00:46:02.177
Wall of monsters.

821
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:04.220
Don't worry. I got this.

822
00:46:11.811 --> 00:46:13.605
Okay. So. they're smarter
than they look.

823
00:46:13.771 --> 00:46:14.856
I could've told you that.

824
00:46:14.939 --> 00:46:16.274
Wait. Jaeger Clade?

825
00:46:16.357 --> 00:46:18.026
-The one and...
-We know.

826
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:19.861
Uh. guys. We're stuck.

827
00:46:21.696 --> 00:46:23.823
-Great idea. Splat.

828
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:25.575
Splat? Its name is Splat?

829
00:46:30.455 --> 00:46:31.915
MERIDIAN: Callisto.
give us a push.

830
00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:36.252
Hang on. everybody.

831
00:46:46.346 --> 00:46:48.431
Oh. I'm so glad you're safe.
little Ethan.

832
00:46:48.515 --> 00:46:50.391
-You had me so worried.
-Uh. okay.

833
00:46:50.475 --> 00:46:51.601
-Sorry.
-

834
00:46:51.684 --> 00:46:54.229
Oh-ho! What is that?
It's so cute.

835
00:46:54.312 --> 00:46:55.522
I wanna merchandise it.

836
00:46:55.605 --> 00:46:56.898
-Ow!

837
00:46:56.981 --> 00:46:58.358
JAEGER: This'll do just fine.

838
00:46:58.525 --> 00:47:01.027
Other side of the mountains.
here I come.

839
00:47:01.110 --> 00:47:02.695
Okay. that's not
what we're here to do.

840
00:47:02.779 --> 00:47:04.739
Ooh. right. Your silly little plant.

841
00:47:04.822 --> 00:47:06.157
It is not silly.

842
00:47:06.241 --> 00:47:08.201
Fine. Your boring little plant.

843
00:47:08.284 --> 00:47:09.619
SEARCHER: You know what I find boring?

844
00:47:09.702 --> 00:47:10.703
JAEGER: Your terrible comeback.

845
00:47:10.787 --> 00:47:12.330
SEARCHER: What? No. Ugh!

846
00:47:12.413 --> 00:47:13.915
-You.
-JAEGER: Oh. clever.

847
00:47:13.998 --> 00:47:16.251
Okay. Adult speaking here.

848
00:47:16.417 --> 00:47:17.669
Searcher's right.

849
00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:20.046
The mission is to get
to Pando's heart.

850
00:47:20.338 --> 00:47:21.548
-SEARCHER: Hmm.
-

851
00:47:21.631 --> 00:47:23.591
'Cause as we can all see.

852
00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:25.468
we are on a clock.

853
00:47:28.012 --> 00:47:29.472
But after we do that.

854
00:47:29.639 --> 00:47:31.349
there's nothing stopping us

855
00:47:31.516 --> 00:47:34.310
from continuing on
to the other side of the mountains.

856
00:47:34.852 --> 00:47:36.229
-Sound like a fair deal?
-

857
00:47:36.312 --> 00:47:38.773
-Okay. Then it's all settled.

858
00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.568
Come on. Ethan. Let's go get
a sample from that Pando root.

859
00:47:41.651 --> 00:47:43.611
Meridian. care to do the honors?

860
00:47:49.742 --> 00:47:51.911
All right. Venture.
I guess this makes us official.

861
00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:54.497
Just don't make me look bad
in front of my family.

862
00:48:10.763 --> 00:48:12.640
-

863
00:48:15.476 --> 00:48:16.686
-Whoa.

864
00:48:27.405 --> 00:48:29.991
CASPIAN: Hey. look.
It's Jaeger Classic.

865
00:48:32.201 --> 00:48:33.661
CREW MEMBER: So nice
to meet you. Mr. Clade.

866
00:48:33.745 --> 00:48:35.038
JAEGER: Nice to meet you.

867
00:48:57.143 --> 00:48:58.936
-

868
00:49:00.438 --> 00:49:01.439
-

869
00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:04.484
-

870
00:49:26.506 --> 00:49:27.590
Wow.

871
00:49:40.770 --> 00:49:42.897
-Awesome.
-

872
00:49:45.358 --> 00:49:46.818
-

873
00:49:48.277 --> 00:49:50.863
JAEGER: Hey. get out of here.
Come on. get. get. get.

874
00:49:50.947 --> 00:49:52.031
Hah. Shoo.

875
00:49:52.115 --> 00:49:53.116
Okay.

876
00:49:53.908 --> 00:49:55.326
Seemed pretty harmless to me.

877
00:49:55.410 --> 00:49:57.370
Eh. better safe than sorry.

878
00:49:58.037 --> 00:49:59.580
So. you're my grandson. huh?

879
00:49:59.747 --> 00:50:01.499
Yep. that's the rumor.

880
00:50:01.666 --> 00:50:03.418
Well. tell me about yourself. Ethan.

881
00:50:03.584 --> 00:50:04.585
What are you into?

882
00:50:04.752 --> 00:50:06.087
Fighting. hunting?

883
00:50:06.379 --> 00:50:09.590
Any sweethearts waiting
for you back home. huh?

884
00:50:09.674 --> 00:50:11.050
Ah...

885
00:50:11.134 --> 00:50:12.135
-There it is.
-

886
00:50:13.594 --> 00:50:14.637
Who is it?

887
00:50:14.721 --> 00:50:16.389
Uh. it's no one. Uh...

888
00:50:16.472 --> 00:50:18.307
Diazo. His name is Diazo.

889
00:50:18.474 --> 00:50:19.559
Diazo. huh?

890
00:50:19.726 --> 00:50:20.727
I really like him a lot.

891
00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:22.395
I just don't know how to tell him

892
00:50:22.478 --> 00:50:24.355
because I just get this.

893
00:50:24.439 --> 00:50:25.440
I always get so this.

894
00:50:25.523 --> 00:50:29.318
Hey. let your grandpa
give you some solid advice.

895
00:50:29.485 --> 00:50:32.155
If you really. really want
to impress this fella.

896
00:50:32.321 --> 00:50:33.614
-this is what you do.
-

897
00:50:33.781 --> 00:50:36.200
You get him into a dangerous situation.

898
00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:39.245
like maybe one
in which he almost dies.

899
00:50:39.328 --> 00:50:40.413
-

900
00:50:41.581 --> 00:50:42.874
And then you save him from it.

901
00:50:42.957 --> 00:50:44.125
-Ahh!

902
00:50:44.208 --> 00:50:46.919
Bonus points if it includes
bandits. alligators.

903
00:50:47.003 --> 00:50:48.921
and/or spectacular explosions.

904
00:50:54.677 --> 00:50:57.180
Hmm. yeah. All that sounds
like a really toxic way

905
00:50:57.263 --> 00:50:58.389
to start a relationship.

906
00:50:58.556 --> 00:51:00.266
Not to mention. crazy dangerous.

907
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:01.350
-JAEGER: Dangerous?

908
00:51:01.768 --> 00:51:03.603
Ha! You're a Clade.

909
00:51:03.770 --> 00:51:04.812
We love danger.

910
00:51:05.521 --> 00:51:07.190
Go ahead. give it a try.

911
00:51:08.524 --> 00:51:10.276
Uh. really? Okay.

912
00:51:10.443 --> 00:51:12.069
-

913
00:51:12.445 --> 00:51:15.865
Oh. yeah. That's a Clade boy
right there.

914
00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:19.535
-Pando schmando.
-

915
00:51:20.369 --> 00:51:21.370
Hey. Dad.

916
00:51:21.454 --> 00:51:23.206
Um. I really appreciate you
bonding with Ethan here.

917
00:51:23.289 --> 00:51:25.541
But maybe a flamethrower
isn't his thing.

918
00:51:27.335 --> 00:51:30.379
I appreciate that you think that.

919
00:51:30.546 --> 00:51:34.133
But maybe Ethan
doesn't know his thing

920
00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.927
unless he tries.

921
00:51:36.511 --> 00:51:37.553
So. go ahead. kiddo.

922
00:51:37.637 --> 00:51:39.722
Well.
I appreciate your enthusiasm.

923
00:51:39.806 --> 00:51:41.307
but Ethan already has a thing.

924
00:51:41.474 --> 00:51:42.934
And it's called
a Pando Picker.

925
00:51:43.017 --> 00:51:44.101
and he's really good with it.

926
00:51:44.685 --> 00:51:48.147
I appreciate your appreciation.
but maybe...

927
00:51:48.231 --> 00:51:50.441
-Uh...
-...we let the kid decide.

928
00:51:50.525 --> 00:51:52.819
Ah. well. I appreciate
your appreciation.

929
00:51:52.902 --> 00:51:54.946
but maybe you'll appreciate me
a little bit more

930
00:51:55.029 --> 00:51:56.030
and respect my wishes. please.

931
00:51:57.198 --> 00:51:59.033
And maybe you should
step out of my air.

932
00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.662
Or maybe we lower
the temperature a little bit.

933
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:04.330
Okay.

934
00:52:04.497 --> 00:52:05.957
What do you have in mind?

935
00:52:06.123 --> 00:52:08.000
A little Primal Outpost.

936
00:52:08.167 --> 00:52:10.795
Ethan. the fate of Pando
is in our hands.

937
00:52:10.962 --> 00:52:12.964
I don't think we have
the luxury of playing games.

938
00:52:13.047 --> 00:52:16.425
Oh. we got a little time
before we hit the Burning Sea.

939
00:52:16.592 --> 00:52:18.344
You go babysit your plant.

940
00:52:18.511 --> 00:52:22.431
My grandson and I
are going to play some cards.

941
00:52:22.515 --> 00:52:23.933
Deal me in.

942
00:52:24.267 --> 00:52:25.977
Can someone trade me a weapon?

943
00:52:26.143 --> 00:52:28.271
All I got is dirt and gardening tools.

944
00:52:28.437 --> 00:52:29.522
I have masonry stones.

945
00:52:29.939 --> 00:52:31.774
Chucking stones could be effective.

946
00:52:31.858 --> 00:52:34.652
Yeah. so that's not
what masonry stones are for.

947
00:52:34.819 --> 00:52:37.154
He's right. I need crossbows.

948
00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:38.948
You got any crossbows?

949
00:52:39.365 --> 00:52:41.492
-Argh!
-

950
00:52:41.576 --> 00:52:43.119
Hey. Splat just stole my cards.

951
00:52:43.202 --> 00:52:44.996
-You get anything good? Hey!

952
00:52:45.079 --> 00:52:48.040
Okay. and time's up.

953
00:52:48.207 --> 00:52:49.292
Trading period has ended.

954
00:52:49.375 --> 00:52:50.585
A-ha! A crossbow.

955
00:52:50.668 --> 00:52:52.420
I knew you were holding out on me.

956
00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:55.047
-Ow.
-

957
00:52:56.632 --> 00:52:58.801
Okay. event card time.

958
00:52:59.218 --> 00:53:01.554
Are you ready to deal with

959
00:53:01.721 --> 00:53:03.180
a demon spider?

960
00:53:03.264 --> 00:53:04.265
JAEGER: Kill it.

961
00:53:04.348 --> 00:53:07.268
Uh. the point is not to kill it.

962
00:53:07.435 --> 00:53:09.270
I know demon spider sounds scary.

963
00:53:09.437 --> 00:53:11.272
Oh. yeah. That thing will
devour our crops for sure.

964
00:53:11.439 --> 00:53:12.732
That's what you're worried about?

965
00:53:13.149 --> 00:53:15.568
The objective of Primal Outpost

966
00:53:15.735 --> 00:53:17.945
is to live harmoniously
with your environment.

967
00:53:18.029 --> 00:53:19.196
I throw masonry stones at it.

968
00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:21.240
JAEGER: And I shoot it
with my brand-new crossbow.

969
00:53:21.324 --> 00:53:24.035
Hmm. Okay. fine. It's dead.
See. you killed it.

970
00:53:24.118 --> 00:53:25.912
That's what I'm talkin' about.

971
00:53:27.163 --> 00:53:28.164
Over. Uh...

972
00:53:28.623 --> 00:53:29.832
Over the... No. around the...

973
00:53:29.916 --> 00:53:31.834
SEARCHER: Open...

974
00:53:31.918 --> 00:53:33.794
-Oh. but wait.
-OTHERS: Hmm?

975
00:53:33.878 --> 00:53:36.172
The demon spider was the only thing

976
00:53:36.255 --> 00:53:37.632
keeping the murder locusts

977
00:53:37.798 --> 00:53:40.009
from destroying all your resources.

978
00:53:40.426 --> 00:53:42.970
-Congrats. you're dead.
-

979
00:53:43.054 --> 00:53:45.139
I agree with that snot bubble here. What?

980
00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:46.974
Wait. The demon spider
wasn't the bad guy?

981
00:53:47.141 --> 00:53:49.435
For the 27th time. there are no bad guys.

982
00:53:49.602 --> 00:53:53.230
The objective isn't to kill
or destroy monsters.

983
00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:56.692
You're just supposed to build
a working civilization

984
00:53:56.859 --> 00:53:58.694
utilizing the environment around you.

985
00:53:59.445 --> 00:54:00.613
Uh-huh. uh-huh.

986
00:54:00.696 --> 00:54:01.822
-SEARCHER: Mm-hmm.
-Uh-huh.

987
00:54:01.906 --> 00:54:03.240
Yeah. I don't get this game.

988
00:54:03.324 --> 00:54:04.909
Me neither.
-

989
00:54:04.992 --> 00:54:06.661
Oh. come...
It is not that complicated.

990
00:54:06.827 --> 00:54:07.912
Maybe I'll just farm Pando.

991
00:54:07.995 --> 00:54:09.038
Pando's not a part of the game.

992
00:54:09.121 --> 00:54:11.040
Can we conquer the monsters
and use them as weapons?

993
00:54:11.207 --> 00:54:12.625
Monsters aren't weapons.

994
00:54:12.792 --> 00:54:13.793
SPLAT: Ta-da!

995
00:54:13.876 --> 00:54:14.877
What? No.

996
00:54:15.044 --> 00:54:17.129
-Check out my new weapon.
-

997
00:54:17.213 --> 00:54:18.464
If he gets a monster. I get Pando.

998
00:54:18.547 --> 00:54:20.591
-No monster. no Pando.
-And no bad guys?

999
00:54:20.675 --> 00:54:22.385
What kind of game has no bad guys?

1000
00:54:22.551 --> 00:54:23.886
JAEGER: That's just poor storytelling.

1001
00:54:24.178 --> 00:54:25.179
Okay. You know what?

1002
00:54:25.554 --> 00:54:26.555
You want bad guys?

1003
00:54:26.722 --> 00:54:28.599
Fine. You two are the bad guys.

1004
00:54:28.766 --> 00:54:31.727
Because you both
are annoying me. Argh!

1005
00:54:35.731 --> 00:54:36.857
-

1006
00:54:36.941 --> 00:54:39.485
Ha. Teenagers. right?

1007
00:54:40.528 --> 00:54:42.571
-I win.
-

1008
00:54:51.831 --> 00:54:53.457
JAEGER: The Burning Sea.

1009
00:54:53.624 --> 00:54:57.086
It's the one obstacle that
stands between Jaeger Clade

1010
00:54:57.503 --> 00:54:59.088
and his destiny.

1011
00:54:59.171 --> 00:55:01.215
Can you go be dramatic
somewhere else?

1012
00:55:01.382 --> 00:55:02.508
What do you see?

1013
00:55:02.591 --> 00:55:03.843
SEARCHER: Looks like
the roots continue

1014
00:55:03.926 --> 00:55:05.678
across the ceiling to the other side.

1015
00:55:05.845 --> 00:55:08.180
Well. if we're gonna find
the heart of Pando.

1016
00:55:08.347 --> 00:55:09.557
we got to get through this.

1017
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:10.641
Hold up.

1018
00:55:10.725 --> 00:55:12.101
You all have eyeballs. right?

1019
00:55:12.268 --> 00:55:13.936
We're all seeing
the same thing. yeah?

1020
00:55:14.103 --> 00:55:15.229
That's acid.

1021
00:55:15.396 --> 00:55:16.605
No one can fly through that.

1022
00:55:31.787 --> 00:55:33.831
Um. what's happening here?

1023
00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:45.259
This is gonna be awesome.

1024
00:55:52.641 --> 00:55:54.685
Uh. are we...
Are we doing this?

1025
00:55:57.021 --> 00:55:58.689
Oh. we're doing this. Okay.

1026
00:56:02.902 --> 00:56:04.111
-

1027
00:56:11.577 --> 00:56:12.912
-

1028
00:56:43.359 --> 00:56:44.777
-

1029
00:56:56.288 --> 00:56:57.623
-

1030
00:56:58.791 --> 00:57:01.502
-That was so Primal Outpost.

1031
00:57:02.336 --> 00:57:04.505
Whew! So glad we're not dead.

1032
00:57:14.098 --> 00:57:15.516
CALLISTO: Get off my ship.

1033
00:57:25.526 --> 00:57:26.777
-JAEGER: No.

1034
00:57:33.868 --> 00:57:35.828
-CALLISTO: Ugh.

1035
00:57:35.911 --> 00:57:37.830
You don't happen to have
another one of these. do you?

1036
00:57:37.997 --> 00:57:39.999
It's okay. I got a better weapon.

1037
00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:46.964
Aim at center mass.

1038
00:57:47.965 --> 00:57:49.925
-Whew.

1039
00:57:51.302 --> 00:57:53.137
-

1040
00:57:53.637 --> 00:57:55.306
-Wow.
-Who taught you how to throw?

1041
00:57:55.472 --> 00:57:56.932
-Sheldon.
-

1042
00:57:57.016 --> 00:57:59.560
-Keep us covered.
-On it.

1043
00:57:59.643 --> 00:58:01.645
All right. This is how you throw.

1044
00:58:01.812 --> 00:58:02.813
Center your weight.

1045
00:58:02.897 --> 00:58:05.399
breathe in. focus

1046
00:58:05.608 --> 00:58:07.193
and follow through.

1047
00:58:07.276 --> 00:58:08.611
-You see.

1048
00:58:08.694 --> 00:58:10.321
it's all in the follow through.

1049
00:58:10.487 --> 00:58:11.739
All right. your turn.

1050
00:58:12.990 --> 00:58:14.867
Okay. Center weight.

1051
00:58:14.950 --> 00:58:16.368
breathe. focus

1052
00:58:16.452 --> 00:58:18.245
and follow through.

1053
00:58:18.495 --> 00:58:20.247
-There you go. Ha.

1054
00:58:20.581 --> 00:58:22.041
Now. take 'em out
on the right.

1055
00:58:22.750 --> 00:58:24.919
-Attaboy. Light 'em up.
-

1056
00:58:27.296 --> 00:58:29.131
-JAEGER: Oh. yeah!
-Serve it up.

1057
00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:31.091
Come on. Pops.

1058
00:58:32.509 --> 00:58:34.136
-Yeah!

1059
00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:37.056
JAEGER: Ah-ha!
You ain't nothin' against the Clades.

1060
00:58:47.358 --> 00:58:49.360
Not too bad for a farmer. right?

1061
00:58:49.902 --> 00:58:51.987
Yeah. not too bad at all.

1062
00:59:07.836 --> 00:59:10.047
Okay. I gotta ask.

1063
00:59:11.507 --> 00:59:12.967
why farming?

1064
00:59:14.218 --> 00:59:17.304
Well. I... I love being outside.

1065
00:59:17.471 --> 00:59:21.433
And being my own boss.

1066
00:59:21.684 --> 00:59:23.727
Right. I get that.

1067
00:59:24.770 --> 00:59:26.313
And I like that I can
pour my heart and soul

1068
00:59:26.397 --> 00:59:28.065
into what I'm growing.

1069
00:59:28.232 --> 00:59:31.777
You know. make sure it becomes
exactly what I need it to be.

1070
00:59:33.153 --> 00:59:35.072
something strong that lasts.

1071
00:59:36.282 --> 00:59:38.575
And a legacy
that my son can be proud of.

1072
00:59:39.743 --> 00:59:40.786
JAEGER: Hmm.

1073
00:59:41.453 --> 00:59:42.788
I get that too.

1074
00:59:58.846 --> 01:00:02.808
You want to know why I didn't
try harder to come home?

1075
01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.938
Well. the thought did cross my mind.

1076
01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:10.566
It's...

1077
01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.652
It's because I'm stuck.

1078
01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:15.612
Well. yeah. I know.

1079
01:00:15.696 --> 01:00:18.449
Yeah. Different kind of stuck.

1080
01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:22.328
You see. I've been an explorer
my whole life.

1081
01:00:23.454 --> 01:00:27.624
Chasing that horizon.
that's all I've ever known.

1082
01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:31.086
Even though it cost me everything.

1083
01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:33.756
You.

1084
01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.091
your mom.

1085
01:00:37.051 --> 01:00:40.054
the last 25 years of my life.

1086
01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:42.890
If I gave up on it.

1087
01:00:43.891 --> 01:00:45.184
what would I be?

1088
01:00:46.310 --> 01:00:48.062
Who would I be?

1089
01:00:57.363 --> 01:00:59.615
too old to change now.

1090
01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:04.161
Right.

1091
01:01:04.244 --> 01:01:07.539
Let's go get another drink
while we still can.

1092
01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.180
-Oh. hi. you.

1093
01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:24.681
-Hey. don't touch that.

1094
01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:26.934
Stop it.

1095
01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:28.227
Stop touching those things.

1096
01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:29.520
-Hey. Hey. Don't.
-

1097
01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:32.523
Hey. stop pushing buttons.
Bad Splat.

1098
01:01:37.069 --> 01:01:39.446
You tried.

1099
01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:44.201
ETHAN: Huh. Look at that.

1100
01:01:44.368 --> 01:01:45.702
They're finally gettin' along.

1101
01:01:45.786 --> 01:01:47.329
About time. right?

1102
01:01:47.413 --> 01:01:48.414
Yeah.

1103
01:01:48.497 --> 01:01:51.375
Especially since they're
basically the same person.

1104
01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:53.377
Mm. don't let your father
hear you say that.

1105
01:01:57.631 --> 01:01:59.425
Hey. you wanna take the wheel?

1106
01:01:59.591 --> 01:02:01.093
I'm dyin' for a cup of coffee.

1107
01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.302
-Wait. Really?
-Yeah.

1108
01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:03.637
Just follow the roots.

1109
01:02:03.804 --> 01:02:05.597
-

1110
01:02:13.397 --> 01:02:15.566
Whoa.
-

1111
01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:20.404
Hmm. If only Diazo could see you now.

1112
01:02:20.487 --> 01:02:21.488
-Huh?
-What?

1113
01:02:21.572 --> 01:02:23.198
You don't think your dad and I talk?

1114
01:02:25.701 --> 01:02:26.743
You're doing great.

1115
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:29.371
Yeah. just watch out
for the walking landmass!

1116
01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:33.417
ETHAN: And I got it. See?

1117
01:02:38.255 --> 01:02:39.548
Sorry. sorry.

1118
01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:41.383
Uh. my bad. We're all good.

1119
01:02:41.467 --> 01:02:43.886
-

1120
01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:45.179
Whew.

1121
01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:47.139
Why is this place so weird?

1122
01:02:47.681 --> 01:02:49.183
Uh. I don't know.

1123
01:02:49.558 --> 01:02:51.018
I think this place is...

1124
01:02:51.560 --> 01:02:52.853
it's kind of amazing.

1125
01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:58.650
You know. I...
I gotta say. Ethan.

1126
01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:01.862
I've never seen you so happy
as you are down here.

1127
01:03:01.945 --> 01:03:04.990
I guess. just...

1128
01:03:05.157 --> 01:03:06.992
The farm is so small.

1129
01:03:07.493 --> 01:03:09.495
The world is so big.

1130
01:03:10.245 --> 01:03:11.497
I just feel

1131
01:03:11.997 --> 01:03:14.041
like I'm in my element.
I don't know.

1132
01:03:18.045 --> 01:03:19.922
What? Why are you
looking at me like that?

1133
01:03:20.005 --> 01:03:21.006
I can look at you.

1134
01:03:21.089 --> 01:03:22.174
Mom. please don't make it weird.

1135
01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:23.592
Moms can't be weird.

1136
01:03:23.759 --> 01:03:25.052
-We gave birth to you.
-

1137
01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:26.220
We've got rights.

1138
01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:27.804
And I'd like to exercise my right

1139
01:03:27.888 --> 01:03:29.097
to stare at you uncomfortably.

1140
01:03:29.181 --> 01:03:30.974
No. you have to focus
on the road.

1141
01:03:31.058 --> 01:03:32.643
You have to look at the road.
You're driving.

1142
01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:33.977
Oh. calm down.

1143
01:03:34.561 --> 01:03:37.689
I'm just saying. you should
keep exploring those feelings.

1144
01:03:38.649 --> 01:03:40.943
Might just lead you down
some interesting paths.

1145
01:03:49.910 --> 01:03:52.663
-

1146
01:04:10.556 --> 01:04:12.724
I've been down here for 25 years

1147
01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:15.185
and I've never seen anything like this.

1148
01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.354
SEARCHER: This doesn't
make any sense.

1149
01:04:18.105 --> 01:04:20.857
Pando seems to be getting
stronger the deeper we go.

1150
01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:24.278
If Pando is dying.
shouldn't it be getting weaker?

1151
01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:26.113
President Mal. the Reapers are here.

1152
01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:27.698
and they brought friends.

1153
01:04:27.864 --> 01:04:29.032
-What?
-

1154
01:04:29.116 --> 01:04:30.659
Meridian. go!

1155
01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:35.998
-

1156
01:04:45.757 --> 01:04:46.758
I can't outrun 'em.

1157
01:04:57.019 --> 01:04:58.312
They didn't attack us.

1158
01:05:00.147 --> 01:05:01.607
But why didn't they attack us?

1159
01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:05.235
It might have something
to do with that.

1160
01:05:10.282 --> 01:05:12.534
I think we found the heart of Pando.

1161
01:05:23.462 --> 01:05:24.463
What are they doing?

1162
01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:25.839
Well. they're doing
what any pest would do.

1163
01:05:25.922 --> 01:05:27.507
They're trying to dig
into Pando's heart

1164
01:05:27.591 --> 01:05:29.176
and devour it from the inside.

1165
01:05:29.343 --> 01:05:31.303
It's fighting for its life out there.

1166
01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:33.805
That's why our plants
are dying up top.

1167
01:05:33.972 --> 01:05:35.641
Pando's rerouting all its energy

1168
01:05:35.724 --> 01:05:37.392
to protect itself right here.

1169
01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:38.852
Our plant's not sick.

1170
01:05:39.353 --> 01:05:40.562
it's at war.

1171
01:05:40.729 --> 01:05:42.773
Well. let's even the odds.

1172
01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:44.441
Easier said than done.

1173
01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:45.651
We have Pando.

1174
01:05:45.734 --> 01:05:47.402
Do you know how much Pando
that would take?

1175
01:05:47.486 --> 01:05:48.528
You got a better idea?

1176
01:05:48.612 --> 01:05:50.572
Yeah. We abandon this lost cause

1177
01:05:50.739 --> 01:05:52.282
and fly to the other side
of the mountains.

1178
01:05:52.366 --> 01:05:53.867
How does that save Pando exactly?

1179
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.286
JAEGER: It doesn't.
But I've lived my whole life

1180
01:05:56.370 --> 01:05:58.038
without the stuff. You'll be fine.

1181
01:05:58.205 --> 01:05:59.456
CALLISTO:
We're not dropping Pando

1182
01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:01.625
just so you can plant your flag.

1183
01:06:01.708 --> 01:06:04.169
Avalonia is depending on us to save it.

1184
01:06:04.336 --> 01:06:05.504
And that's what we're gonna do.

1185
01:06:05.587 --> 01:06:06.797
SEARCHER:
I couldn't agree more.

1186
01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.507
Dad. what are you doing?

1187
01:06:11.218 --> 01:06:13.428
-

1188
01:06:15.055 --> 01:06:17.140
Just like how we do it on our farm.

1189
01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:19.351
Now that's a Clade boy!

1190
01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:21.895
Listen up. bring up every
crate of Pando from the hull.

1191
01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:23.271
Looks like we're turning the Venture

1192
01:06:23.355 --> 01:06:25.399
into the world's biggest crop duster.

1193
01:06:44.251 --> 01:06:46.503
-

1194
01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.047
-Huh?

1195
01:06:49.131 --> 01:06:50.215
What is it. Splat?

1196
01:06:51.633 --> 01:06:52.634
What?

1197
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:55.011
What?

1198
01:06:55.095 --> 01:06:56.763
Oh.
-

1199
01:06:58.724 --> 01:07:00.392
What does that mean?
I don't understand.

1200
01:07:00.475 --> 01:07:02.477
Ethan. come here for a sec.

1201
01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:04.521
I'm sorry. Splat.
I gotta go.

1202
01:07:06.398 --> 01:07:07.399
Yeah. Dad?

1203
01:07:07.482 --> 01:07:09.401
We came down here to save our farm

1204
01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:11.361
and that's what
we're gonna do. together.

1205
01:07:12.195 --> 01:07:13.280
You know what?

1206
01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:16.116
Um. I'm good.
I wouldn't even know what to do.

1207
01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:17.784
It's simple. you just point and spray.

1208
01:07:17.951 --> 01:07:19.661
This is more your thing. Dad.

1209
01:07:19.828 --> 01:07:22.164
This is our thing. Ethan.
Father and son.

1210
01:07:22.330 --> 01:07:24.624
It just doesn't feel right to me.

1211
01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:26.668
I don't want to kill all these creatures.

1212
01:07:27.169 --> 01:07:28.670
Well. don't think of it as killing.

1213
01:07:28.837 --> 01:07:30.756
We're just exterminating some pests

1214
01:07:30.839 --> 01:07:32.632
trying to destroy our crops.

1215
01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:36.428
We're farmers. Ethan.

1216
01:07:37.179 --> 01:07:38.346
This is what farmers do.

1217
01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:41.308
Well. then. maybe I'm not a farmer.

1218
01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:42.809
What?

1219
01:07:43.185 --> 01:07:44.478
I'm not a farmer. Dad.

1220
01:07:45.896 --> 01:07:48.398
Ethan. where is all this coming from?

1221
01:07:48.482 --> 01:07:49.566
This doesn't sound like you.

1222
01:07:49.649 --> 01:07:50.984
But it is me. Dad.

1223
01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:53.987
This is probably the most me
I've ever been. I just...

1224
01:07:54.154 --> 01:07:57.115
I feel like I'm in my element
when I'm exploring this world.

1225
01:07:57.324 --> 01:07:58.825
Exploring?

1226
01:07:59.034 --> 01:08:00.911
Well. yeah. I mean. there's...

1227
01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.288
there's just so much
to discover here and...

1228
01:08:03.371 --> 01:08:05.290
Wait. wait. are you...
are you saying.

1229
01:08:05.373 --> 01:08:06.958
you want to be an explorer?

1230
01:08:07.042 --> 01:08:08.460
Hey. is everything all right?

1231
01:08:08.543 --> 01:08:09.669
-Is this because of him?
-What?

1232
01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:10.879
-It is. isn't it?
-No.

1233
01:08:10.962 --> 01:08:13.173
-What did you say to Ethan?
-I didn't say anything.

1234
01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:14.382
Dad. it's not Grandpa's fault.

1235
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:16.134
Are you trying to brainwash my son?

1236
01:08:16.218 --> 01:08:17.844
-Brainwash?
-Ethan. will you trust me?

1237
01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:19.888
You do not want to be like him.

1238
01:08:20.055 --> 01:08:22.224
The only thing he cares about is himself

1239
01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:24.351
and conquering those mountains.

1240
01:08:24.518 --> 01:08:26.853
I know you. Ethan. And this isn't you.

1241
01:08:29.272 --> 01:08:30.607
-Ethan. come back here.

1242
01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:33.443
Ethan. Ethan!

1243
01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:36.947
Are you crazy?

1244
01:08:37.364 --> 01:08:39.741
-Hey. get on this skiff now.
-Leave me alone.

1245
01:08:45.163 --> 01:08:46.540
Hey. what is this all about?

1246
01:08:46.623 --> 01:08:48.792
-You. Dad. You.
-Me?

1247
01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:50.669
You just assume
I'll follow in your footsteps.

1248
01:08:50.752 --> 01:08:52.712
but you never asked me
what I wanted.

1249
01:08:52.796 --> 01:08:53.922
You're a kid.

1250
01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:55.590
You don't know what you want.

1251
01:08:55.757 --> 01:08:58.051
I know I don't wanna be you.

1252
01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:27.455
My whole life. I worked so hard

1253
01:09:27.956 --> 01:09:29.958
to be the exact opposite of my dad.

1254
01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:34.838
And. uh. looks like
I ended up just like him.

1255
01:09:39.718 --> 01:09:41.970
I just wanted so badly
to build you a legacy

1256
01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:43.305
you could be proud of.

1257
01:09:44.723 --> 01:09:48.393
But I mighta got
a little bit caught up in it.

1258
01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:50.061
Dad. stop talking.

1259
01:09:50.145 --> 01:09:51.980
Ethan. I'm trying to apologize here.

1260
01:09:52.063 --> 01:09:53.064
Dad.

1261
01:09:59.988 --> 01:10:01.907
I think we're on the other side
of the mountains.

1262
01:10:10.874 --> 01:10:14.169
There is nothing but water out there.

1263
01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:15.503
-

1264
01:10:42.822 --> 01:10:45.408
That's an eye. right?

1265
01:10:45.909 --> 01:10:46.910
Yeah.

1266
01:10:46.993 --> 01:10:50.538
A... A really. really big eye.

1267
01:10:50.622 --> 01:10:51.623
Yeah.

1268
01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:54.209
SEARCHER: And it's looking right at us.

1269
01:10:54.626 --> 01:10:55.919
You...

1270
01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:57.379
You know what this means. right?

1271
01:10:57.462 --> 01:10:58.964
-It's judging me?
-No. no.

1272
01:10:59.047 --> 01:11:00.924
If this place has an eye.

1273
01:11:01.091 --> 01:11:02.676
it has to be attached to a head.

1274
01:11:02.842 --> 01:11:04.094
And if this place has a head.

1275
01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.137
that means what we've been
travelling through

1276
01:11:06.221 --> 01:11:08.139
this entire time was its insides.

1277
01:11:08.223 --> 01:11:09.516
Like. its guts and stuff?

1278
01:11:09.599 --> 01:11:11.101
Okay. yes. Hear me out.

1279
01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:12.852
The windy forests that we were in.

1280
01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:14.270
that's the lungs.

1281
01:11:14.354 --> 01:11:16.690
And... And the acid lake?
That's the stomach.

1282
01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:20.610
And this giant eye must be its eye.

1283
01:11:21.194 --> 01:11:22.404
The Reapers aren't monsters.

1284
01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:24.906
-They're an immune system.
-What?

1285
01:11:25.073 --> 01:11:27.075
That's what Splat was trying to tell me.

1286
01:11:27.242 --> 01:11:29.035
This place is alive.

1287
01:11:29.202 --> 01:11:30.328
It's a living thing.

1288
01:11:30.412 --> 01:11:31.871
We didn't find the heart of Pando.

1289
01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:33.915
We found an actual heart.

1290
01:11:34.499 --> 01:11:37.502
So. all this time.

1291
01:11:38.128 --> 01:11:40.296
we've been living on the back

1292
01:11:40.714 --> 01:11:42.674
of this giant creature?

1293
01:11:42.841 --> 01:11:45.677
Yeah. And Pando is killing it.

1294
01:11:46.761 --> 01:11:49.305
-

1295
01:11:57.480 --> 01:12:00.150
This creature's immune system
has no way to defend itself.

1296
01:12:00.233 --> 01:12:01.317
We need to hurry.

1297
01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:07.991
-

1298
01:12:08.867 --> 01:12:09.868
What?

1299
01:12:10.452 --> 01:12:11.995
Wha... I don't know
what you just said.

1300
01:12:12.078 --> 01:12:13.663
but I'm pretty sure
it was inappropriate.

1301
01:12:13.830 --> 01:12:15.206
Mom. you have to turn
the ship around.

1302
01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:16.791
-I'm sorry. what?
-Mission's over.

1303
01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:18.793
This place is not what it seems.

1304
01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.670
-Is there a problem?
-Big problem.

1305
01:12:20.754 --> 01:12:23.006
Listen. Ethan and I
got into a huge fight.

1306
01:12:23.298 --> 01:12:24.299
So I jumped off the ship.

1307
01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:25.467
You jumped off the ship?

1308
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:26.926
-But he's safe.
-Dad came after me.

1309
01:12:27.010 --> 01:12:28.011
And the next thing we know.

1310
01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:29.262
we're on the other side
of the mountains.

1311
01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:30.847
-What?
-Staring directly at

1312
01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:32.724
-a giant creature!
-A giant creature!

1313
01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:33.808
What?

1314
01:12:33.892 --> 01:12:35.226
-A giant creature?
-He can't be serious.

1315
01:12:35.310 --> 01:12:38.813
Okay. listen. This place.
this world that we live on.

1316
01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:40.190
is a living thing.

1317
01:12:40.356 --> 01:12:42.025
And Pando is killing it.

1318
01:12:42.192 --> 01:12:44.736
If we want to survive.
Pando has to go.

1319
01:12:44.819 --> 01:12:45.820
-What?
-What?

1320
01:12:45.904 --> 01:12:47.322
-You want us to destroy Pando?
-JAEGER: Pfft!

1321
01:12:47.405 --> 01:12:49.365
They don't know
what they saw out there.

1322
01:12:49.449 --> 01:12:51.201
Dad? Dad. stop.

1323
01:12:51.493 --> 01:12:52.494
Where are you going?

1324
01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:54.287
To the other side of the mountains.

1325
01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:55.997
I'm gonna see this for myself.

1326
01:12:56.164 --> 01:12:58.500
Are you serious? This world is dying.

1327
01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:00.043
-I need your help.
-

1328
01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:02.045
What do you know about this world?

1329
01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:03.254
What do I know about this world?

1330
01:13:03.338 --> 01:13:04.339
I know what I saw.

1331
01:13:04.506 --> 01:13:06.091
I dedicated my whole life

1332
01:13:06.174 --> 01:13:08.718
to doing something
that no one has ever done.

1333
01:13:08.885 --> 01:13:12.555
and I did everything I could
to train you up

1334
01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:14.849
so that you could be
right there with me

1335
01:13:14.933 --> 01:13:16.017
when I did it.

1336
01:13:16.184 --> 01:13:19.020
This was supposed to be our legacy.

1337
01:13:19.187 --> 01:13:20.814
Father and son.

1338
01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:22.565
You wanna talk about legacy?

1339
01:13:22.649 --> 01:13:24.067
I'm about to destroy mine.

1340
01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:25.985
For my son.

1341
01:13:26.069 --> 01:13:27.153
Something you could never do.

1342
01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.404
Oh. right.

1343
01:13:28.488 --> 01:13:30.073
Because I'm a horrible father.

1344
01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:31.157
Yeah.

1345
01:13:31.783 --> 01:13:33.368
But you didn't have to be.

1346
01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:39.582
Here.

1347
01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:42.377
The other side of the mountains
is due east.

1348
01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:56.224
Okay.

1349
01:13:56.307 --> 01:13:57.892
Callisto?
-ETHAN: Dad.

1350
01:13:57.976 --> 01:13:59.018
Get your hands off me.

1351
01:13:59.102 --> 01:14:00.854
Emotions are running
really high right now.

1352
01:14:01.020 --> 01:14:03.731
And I don't know
what you think you saw.

1353
01:14:03.815 --> 01:14:06.734
But we came down here to save Pando.

1354
01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:08.194
That plan hasn't changed.

1355
01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:09.946
You have no idea what you're doing.

1356
01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:12.115
-You are going to destroy Avalonia.
-MERIDIAN: No. let me go!

1357
01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:13.283
SEARCHER: Please.
you gotta listen to me!

1358
01:14:14.742 --> 01:14:16.661
-You're makin' a big mistake.

1359
01:14:16.828 --> 01:14:18.496
You gotta get us outta here.
Unlock this door.

1360
01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:21.249
No. you can't do this.
You have to listen to me.

1361
01:14:23.084 --> 01:14:24.377
-

1362
01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.880
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to see outside.

1363
01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:29.007
Hey. Ethan. you think you can
reach your arm under here

1364
01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:30.258
and up to the door handle?

1365
01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:31.718
-Clearly. no.
-

1366
01:14:31.801 --> 01:14:33.303
-Wait. What's that noise?
-

1367
01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:36.514
-Ugh! No tongue.
-Legend.

1368
01:14:38.141 --> 01:14:40.768
Hey. boy. Hey.
Open the door. Yeah.

1369
01:14:40.852 --> 01:14:42.312
-He can do it. Open the door.
-Open the door.

1370
01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:43.730
MERIDIAN: Come on. Legend.
You can do it.

1371
01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:45.106
-Come on. Legend.
-ETHAN: Open the door.

1372
01:14:45.190 --> 01:14:46.191
Open the door.

1373
01:14:46.274 --> 01:14:47.901
MERIDIAN: That's Mama's baby.
That's Mama's baby.

1374
01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:49.360
-You can do it. You can do it.
-SEARCHER: Open the door.

1375
01:14:49.444 --> 01:14:51.446
-Open the door!
-Can you not yell at my dog?

1376
01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:53.072
Well. I wouldn't yell
if he were actually trained.

1377
01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:54.157
He is trained.

1378
01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:55.867
He hasn't peed in the house
for the last two days.

1379
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:57.827
We've been on this ship
for the last two days.

1380
01:14:59.454 --> 01:15:01.414
-

1381
01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:05.001
You still have to unlock it.

1382
01:15:05.084 --> 01:15:06.586
There's a switch
right beside the handle.

1383
01:15:06.669 --> 01:15:08.046
Legend. do you see the switch?

1384
01:15:08.213 --> 01:15:09.422
Legend. you see the switch?

1385
01:15:12.133 --> 01:15:13.968
What is that sound?
Is he licking the switch?

1386
01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:15.762
Legend. stop licking the switch.

1387
01:15:15.845 --> 01:15:17.055
-Legend. stop.

1388
01:15:17.138 --> 01:15:18.389
Legend. stop licking the switch.

1389
01:15:18.473 --> 01:15:19.641
Stop licking the switch!

1390
01:15:36.824 --> 01:15:38.284
Okay. what's the plan?

1391
01:15:38.368 --> 01:15:39.786
Let's get back control of this ship.

1392
01:15:39.869 --> 01:15:41.162
-

1393
01:15:42.247 --> 01:15:43.748
-

1394
01:15:43.831 --> 01:15:45.375
I'm not qualified to fly this ship.

1395
01:15:47.335 --> 01:15:48.711
Piloting is hard.

1396
01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:52.090
-Huh. that was easy.
-Okay. What now?

1397
01:15:52.173 --> 01:15:54.050
Pando defenses
are keeping those creatures

1398
01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:55.843
from destroying it from the inside.

1399
01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:59.430
But if I can dig
a hole for them...

1400
01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:00.932
They can take care of the rest.

1401
01:16:01.015 --> 01:16:02.684
I'll keep Callisto off your back.

1402
01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:04.269
And you keep our son safe out there.

1403
01:16:04.435 --> 01:16:06.562
Wait. what?
He is not coming with me.

1404
01:16:06.646 --> 01:16:08.147
Tell him that.

1405
01:16:08.231 --> 01:16:10.149
Hey. you comin' or what?
We're on the clock.

1406
01:16:17.865 --> 01:16:20.493
Remember. everybody.
Avalonia's depending on us.

1407
01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:24.038
Oh. was that Searcher and Ethan?

1408
01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:25.915
What's happening?

1409
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:30.670
Argh! They took the bridge.
Come on.

1410
01:16:35.425 --> 01:16:36.759
-

1411
01:17:09.167 --> 01:17:11.419
-

1412
01:17:17.258 --> 01:17:18.343
Right there.

1413
01:17:18.426 --> 01:17:19.761
Where all the roots converge.

1414
01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:21.262
If the Reapers attack that.

1415
01:17:21.346 --> 01:17:22.847
the rest of the plant will crumble.

1416
01:17:24.182 --> 01:17:26.559
Meridian. open this door.

1417
01:17:26.642 --> 01:17:27.935
Sorry. Can't hear ya.

1418
01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:30.063
Don't worry. President Mal.

1419
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:31.606
I got this.

1420
01:17:34.901 --> 01:17:36.444
Wait here.

1421
01:17:41.407 --> 01:17:43.076
You and Splat round up
every creature you can

1422
01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:44.452
-and you send them my way.
-

1423
01:17:44.535 --> 01:17:46.329
-I'll do the rest.
-You've got it. Dad.

1424
01:17:48.206 --> 01:17:49.415
I'm sorry if I ever made you think

1425
01:17:49.499 --> 01:17:51.626
that you had to be a farmer
to make me proud.

1426
01:17:52.210 --> 01:17:53.211
I'm always proud of you.

1427
01:17:53.378 --> 01:17:55.380
I know. Dad. I know.

1428
01:18:07.225 --> 01:18:09.394
Let go of those controls.

1429
01:18:09.894 --> 01:18:11.062
-Okay.
-

1430
01:18:14.524 --> 01:18:15.775
Grab the controls.

1431
01:18:15.858 --> 01:18:18.111
Put 'em on. take 'em off.
put 'em on. take 'em...

1432
01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:19.320
Make up your mind.

1433
01:18:24.742 --> 01:18:25.743
Ugh!

1434
01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.420
-

1435
01:18:38.506 --> 01:18:40.174
Hey. guys. Remember me?

1436
01:18:45.012 --> 01:18:47.974
Meridian.
stop this ship right now.

1437
01:18:48.057 --> 01:18:49.976
No problem. We're here.

1438
01:18:53.938 --> 01:18:55.481
Now do you see
what we're dealing with?

1439
01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:57.942
-That's a heart.
-

1440
01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.745
-

1441
01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.474
-SEARCHER: No.
-

1442
01:19:31.434 --> 01:19:32.935
JAEGER: On your feet. Searcher.

1443
01:19:34.437 --> 01:19:35.438
Dad?

1444
01:19:46.032 --> 01:19:48.534
My legacy isn't those mountains.

1445
01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:51.746
It's you.

1446
01:19:53.414 --> 01:19:54.832
Now let's do this.

1447
01:19:55.917 --> 01:19:57.251
Father and son.

1448
01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:17.104
There.

1449
01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:30.326
Keep digging.

1450
01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:40.336
ETHAN: Dad!

1451
01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.838
Get out of the way!
Here they come!

1452
01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:03.276
-

1453
01:21:32.471 --> 01:21:34.348
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

1454
01:21:38.811 --> 01:21:41.480
-Yes! Yeah!

1455
01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:44.233
Yeah. we did it. We did it.

1456
01:21:44.734 --> 01:21:45.735
We did it.

1457
01:21:47.862 --> 01:21:48.863
Right?

1458
01:22:15.598 --> 01:22:16.766
We were too late.

1459
01:22:37.244 --> 01:22:39.372
-

1460
01:23:38.806 --> 01:23:40.516
-

1461
01:23:46.814 --> 01:23:49.066
-SEARCHER: Whoa.
-

1462
01:24:02.997 --> 01:24:03.998
Whew.

1463
01:24:12.173 --> 01:24:13.924
-

1464
01:24:24.810 --> 01:24:27.396
-

1465
01:25:05.226 --> 01:25:06.602
All right. next stop.

1466
01:25:06.685 --> 01:25:09.271
no power. cold coffee
and angry masses.

1467
01:25:09.355 --> 01:25:11.065
Who's ready to go home?

1468
01:25:16.111 --> 01:25:18.447
Actually. I'd like to make one stop

1469
01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:20.574
for my dad.

1470
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:42.012
-

1471
01:26:17.256 --> 01:26:20.843
I spent my whole life
wondering about this moment.

1472
01:26:22.136 --> 01:26:23.429
What'd it be like?

1473
01:26:23.596 --> 01:26:25.514
What it'd look like?

1474
01:26:25.681 --> 01:26:28.559
What'd it feel like?

1475
01:26:31.145 --> 01:26:32.438
And how does it feel?

1476
01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.690
Feels

1477
01:26:35.941 --> 01:26:37.526
perfect.

1478
01:26:38.152 --> 01:26:40.571
-

1479
01:27:15.981 --> 01:27:17.316
ETHAN: Dear Dad.

1480
01:27:17.399 --> 01:27:21.987
though it's been an incredibly
challenging year.

1481
01:27:22.071 --> 01:27:24.740
it's inspiring to see
how resilient people can be.

1482
01:27:29.036 --> 01:27:31.205
-Penelope.

1483
01:27:31.372 --> 01:27:32.665
ETHAN: We can be resourceful.

1484
01:27:36.794 --> 01:27:38.128
Sheldon?

1485
01:27:38.212 --> 01:27:40.255
-ETHAN: We can surprise.
-

1486
01:27:41.507 --> 01:27:43.550
The world's clearly changed.

1487
01:27:43.634 --> 01:27:44.635
MAN: Thanks. man.

1488
01:27:44.718 --> 01:27:46.261
And it continues to change.

1489
01:27:48.013 --> 01:27:50.182
And though we can't live
like we did in the past...

1490
01:27:53.102 --> 01:27:55.604
...we've now given ourselves
a better chance at a future.

1491
01:28:03.028 --> 01:28:06.532
We're not quite there yet.
but we will be.

1492
01:28:08.450 --> 01:28:10.619
Because the best legacy
we can leave

1493
01:28:10.786 --> 01:28:13.288
is making a present
worth opening tomorrow.

1494
01:28:14.957 --> 01:28:16.041
Thank you

1495
01:28:16.542 --> 01:28:18.127
for everything you've given me.

1496
01:28:19.753 --> 01:28:21.672
I'll do my best
to live up to your legacy.

1497
01:28:22.965 --> 01:28:24.383
I hope I make you proud.

1498
01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:26.135
Love always.

1499
01:28:26.677 --> 01:28:27.928
your son.

1500
01:39:40.934 --> 01:39:42.477
They're the Clades

1501
01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:43.853
They're the Clades

1502
01:39:43.937 --> 01:39:46.981
Cue the band
And start the grand parades

1503
01:39:47.065 --> 01:39:48.650
Ever bold

1504
01:39:48.733 --> 01:39:50.110
Hearts of gold

1505
01:39:50.193 --> 01:39:51.695
Over sea and sky and land

1506
01:39:51.778 --> 01:39:53.238
Bound together hand in hand

1507
01:39:53.321 --> 01:39:55.031
They're the Clades

1508
01:39:56.783 --> 01:39:59.744
MALE SINGER:
Forging brave new chapters

1509
01:39:59.828 --> 01:40:02.831
Of their legacy

1510
01:40:02.914 --> 01:40:05.959
Facing every scrape and jam

1511
01:40:06.042 --> 01:40:08.712
As a mighty family

1512
01:40:15.093 --> 01:40:16.469
MALE CHORUS:
They're the Clades

1513
01:40:16.553 --> 01:40:18.012
They're the Clades

1514
01:40:18.096 --> 01:40:21.182
Worthy of the highest accolades

1515
01:40:21.266 --> 01:40:22.642
Standing tall

1516
01:40:22.726 --> 01:40:24.269
Risking all

1517
01:40:24.352 --> 01:40:25.770
Braving roads beyond the maps

1518
01:40:25.854 --> 01:40:27.522
Bounding generation gaps

1519
01:40:28.982 --> 01:40:30.608
They're the Clades

1520
01:40:39.868 --> 01:40:41.703
Whether farming or exploring

1521
01:40:41.786 --> 01:40:42.954
Raise up your voice in roaring

1522
01:40:43.037 --> 01:40:44.372
Serenades

1523
01:40:44.456 --> 01:40:45.999
For the Clades

1524
01:40:46.082 --> 01:40:49.794
And their endless escapades

1525
01:40:50.587 --> 01:40:51.963
They're the Clades
