GAMBLING CHIP

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.550
Oh my God!

3
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.870
I must call for help.

4
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.992
I have something in my pocket
that you've never seen before.

5
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.551
Work-related.
irregularly regular. temporary-

6
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.439
subchronic lack of money.
- Jussi. what you just described -

7
00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.479
is painfully familiar to all of
us private entrepreneurs.

8
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.631
In earthly terms. "dirt-poorness".

9
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.476
A most familiar state of affairs
for us artists.

10
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.916
I see. Well. I'm going to
stimulate myself to home base. -

11
00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.832
at exactly 1.200 metres from here.

12
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.673
Hey. if push really comes to shove -

13
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.800
our Antiquarian Bookstore
will even buy encyclopaedias.

14
00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.553
Payment in cash.
- That's good to know.

15
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.518
In case of necessity. - Yeah.

16
00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.350
Chip card into the blue slot.
and you'll get home before dawn.

17
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.237
Oh...

18
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.631
Here you are.

19
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.711
Goddammit...

20
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.190
Try to concentrate. will you?

21
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.474
It might work better that way.
Can I help you?

22
00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.873
<i>The strange woman's purse was</i>
<i>definitely more expensive-</i>

23
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.508
<i>than my car.</i>

24
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.110
Transaction rejected
Insufficient funds

25
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.039
<i>Sole Sulavesi. 35.</i>
<i>Born in Helsinki.</i>

26
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.879
Hey. I'm sorry about what I said.

27
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.231
Oh. fuck!

28
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.079
Look. I'm sorry.
Is everything OK?

29
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.630
No! But how the hell would you know!

30
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.713
<i>In 30 seconds.</i>
<i>I knew more about this woman-</i>

31
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.000
<i>than I knew about my neighbours</i>
<i>whom I saw every day.</i>

<i>A woman's ungrounded hysteria</i>
<i>always attracts a man's attention.</i>

33
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.110
Yes. address the invoice to me
at the Natunen Corporation.

34
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.838
My name is Topi Penkki. Good.

35
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:47.195
I agree with you on this.
I just wanted to make sure.

36
00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.952
Mrs Natunen.

37
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.870
How did the old saying go?
What happens to the greedy ones?

38
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:55.552
Here you are.

39
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.154
All right.
I know a suitable subcontractor.

40
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.552
Great. That's all I want to know.

41
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.996
This thing won't be disturbing
our businesses much longer.

42
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.436
Can I set the wheels in motion
right away? - Of course.

43
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.589
The down payment.
- See you tomorrow.

44
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.836
Good morning. Jussi.
I didn't wake you up. did I? -No.

45
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.510
I noticed you came home
at a decent hour last night.

46
00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:44.672
<i>The almost daily need of Anna's</i>
<i>to use my shower-</i>

47
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.394
<i>as hers was always broken-</i>

48
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.915
<i>had been my only contact with women</i>
<i>in a long time.</i>

49
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.436
<i>Why did I suddenly feel that I
<i>needed something more from women?</i></i>

50
00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:59.119
Thanks a lot. once again.

51
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.710
You're welcome.

52
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.350
Thanks.

53
00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.555
Jussi. what's the matter?

54
00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.678
Cough up. What's wrong?
You're not yourself at all.

55
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.189
I hurt a stranger yesterday.

56
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.197
Am I getting old or something?

57
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.954
I feel bad about what I did.

58
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:36.029
Well. find the guy.
Say that you're sorry.

59
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.590
You're the private eye here.

60
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.230
Besides. isn't tracking someone down
all routine to you?

61
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.715
My shift starts soon.

62
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.077
I can drive you somewhere
if you want. OK?

63
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.430
This coffee tastes like shit.

64
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.191
Well. well. if it isn't Mr Vares
and his daily usual.

65
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.236
Did you get an inheritance -

66
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.949
or are you preparing
fora date with a femme fatal?

67
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:13.397
The latter is closer to the truth.
Come on. have a pint with me.

68
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:16.915
No can do. I'm having a one-on-one
with an ex-Playboy girl.

69
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:20.435
She's here in Turku
for some dog show. - Really?

70
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.514
That explains the pink poodle shirt
and the whiff of hairspray.

71
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.513
You're giving her
some drawing paper?

72
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:33.514
I've been sent some weird letters.
Possible source material.

73
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.671
Or toxic waste. don't know yet.

74
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.356
Come on. take one for the road.
- I can't. Good luck.

75
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.432
Hey. keep in mind that
too much booze-

76
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.910
may cause erectile dysfunction
in middle aged men.

77
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.195
Don't worry. you'll get used to it.

78
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.193
Hey. Ruuhio.
take these with you.

79
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.438
Keep out of trouble.

80
00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.153
I've been to this address before!

81
00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:15.875
Thanks. Put it on my tab. will you?

82
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.713
OK. Hey. good luck with the...

83
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.838
Good luck with...
with the hysteric.

84
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.672
Good morning.
Want a cup of espresso?

85
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:57.036
I'm more used to
the straight guy's coffee.

86
00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.709
It's hot in here.

87
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.915
Look... I have a bad memory...

88
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.792
Did we... you know?

89
00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:19.828
A. I never take a man into my bed
on the first night.

90
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.870
B. You saw fit
to pass out like a light last night.

91
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:28.348
I'm really sorry.

92
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.999
I slept in the guest room.

93
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:36.190
C. You know nothing
about a straight guy's coffee -

94
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.675
until you've tasted this.

95
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.516
What is it then?

96
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.234
<i>Caffè corretto.</i>

97
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.159
<i>Carajillo</i> in Spanish.

98
00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:00.874
What would be your D then?

99
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.276
The first night rule
does not necessarily apply-

100
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.316
the following morning.

101
00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.033
Should we skip over E
and go straight to F?

102
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.675
1 to 6 tablets daily
as needed for anxiety

103
00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.115
Juhani.

104
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.269
You know. I had a feeling
at the cash machine -

105
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.238
that we'd meet again.

106
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.790
Quite an unusual profession.
private detective.

107
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.518
What does it mean in practice?

108
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:55.668
Digging into people's private
affairs. sifting through archives -

109
00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.718
sitting in the car.
sleepless nights...

110
00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.518
Nothing romantic about it.

111
00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.029
Have you ever had...

112
00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:10.070
...any thrilling cases?
- You mean like...

113
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.835
Murder. for example?
- Of course I have.

114
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:18.318
But they're quite nasty cases.
Let's not talk about them.

115
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.194
I'd rather talk about you.

116
00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:25.031
What seems to be troubling you.
Mrs Sulavesi?

117
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:29.995
Ex-Mrs Sulavesi!
That's all you need to know for now.

118
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:11.958
Hey. Jussi Vares
and a clean white shirt!

119
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:18.798
The world's only private detective
who is also a male prostitute.

120
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.510
Starting to be as rare a sight
around these parts-

121
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:28.038
as the world's only
erotic pole dancer-

122
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:32.238
who is also a taxi chauffeuse.
- What is not rare at all is -

123
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:35.391
that our short-story writer
has marinated himself-

124
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.915
to light years away from
anywhere and beyond.

125
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:44.677
Even marinated. I can see that my
good friend Jussi Vares is in love.

126
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.118
Nonsense. I say!

127
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.272
Vares knows as much about love
as a pig knows about false teeth!

128
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:58.469
Anna. do you know what is the metal
of which they've made this pole-

129
00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.077
that you rub your most beautiful
body part against every night?

130
00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.715
No. I don't.

131
00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:11.872
Cunt-resistant metal!
- Why don't you piss off. Luusalmi!

132
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.871
That's the way to go. Nice style!

133
00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:16.600
Jussi. there's a car
waiting for you outside.

134
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.717
A penny for your thoughts.
Mrs Sulavesi.

135
00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:04.033
I can't afford more than that.
- I guess not.

136
00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:12.474
Are you cold? -No.

137
00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.153
Jussi. I'd like to ask you a favour.

138
00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:43.110
It's about my brother's
birthday party.

139
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.513
At your service.

140
00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:25.871
Mr Stahanov.
You are a punctual man.

141
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:30.749
Mr Penkki. In my profession.
punctuality is a virtue.

142
00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.876
That's great.

143
00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.636
Good.

144
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.031
Thank you.

145
00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:21.313
Thanks. - I'm not a suit man.
this tie is strangling me...

146
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.629
I hate this as much as you do.

147
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:28.589
What kind of people are they?
- Timppa owns an IT company.

148
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.189
His wife. Susanna. awful woman. -

149
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.557
is the head of
a private nursing home.

150
00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.630
Zip up your fly!

151
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.870
The mosquito repellents
never work...

152
00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.198
<i>Once again. one should have known</i>
<i>more than one knew.</i>

153
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:49.910
<i>About exchange rates.</i>
<i>golf handicaps and the VIPs.</i>

154
00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.396
<i>The birthday boy.</i>
<i>Sole's brother Timo Petterson-</i>

155
00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.279
<i>was a full-blooded Lions Club lion.</i>
<i>and hls wife Susanna-</i>

156
00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.034
<i>looked like she could have used</i>
<i>more cloth for her dress.</i>

157
00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:05.510
Agreat vintage...
- Of course. what else?

158
00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:10.954
This is... Jussi Vares.
- Jussi Vares. Congratulations.

159
00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.315
Timo Petterson. Thank you.

160
00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.788
Hi. Susanna. - My wife Susanna.

161
00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.953
...well it comes
all the way from Brussels...

Hello. - Hi.

Hi. - Hi.

Oh. it's you!

Hampus. hello.

00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.189
What do you think?

171
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:09.870
Nice party.

172
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.592
I meant the painting.
It's my latest purchase.

173
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.116
You've been staring at it quite
intensively for the last 30 minutes.

174
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.112
I bought it
from Liljevalchs in Stockholm.

175
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:27.114
Quite impressive. isn't it?
- It creates powerful associations.

176
00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:29.759
Yes. and it cost us
quite a bit of money!

177
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.115
Well. here you are.

178
00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:34.795
What a small glass I have.

179
00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:38.998
How about that!
- Dear Sole never gets tired -

180
00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.596
of dragging here
those pitiful fiancés-to-be.

181
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.672
Don't worry.
you'll find your Mr Right.

182
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:48.873
I think I've tested out
enough of them!

183
00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.317
Ouch!

184
00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:56.512
OK. we're out of here.

185
00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.594
[Skipped item nr. 185]

186
00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:05.594
Sole had enough of her brother.
her sister-in-law -

187
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:08.114
<i>and the insolent</i>
<i>bank manager von Knorr-</i>

188
00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:12.477
<i>just when I was starting to enjoy</i>
<i>their dull garden party.</i>

189
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:22.554
<i>But there was worse to come.</i>
<i>I had introduced Sole to Alanen-</i>

190
00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:27.714
<i>and they had agreed to take a tour</i>
<i>of the Turku cathedral.</i>

191
00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:31.352
<i>I could imagine how Luusalmi</i>
<i>would go on. evenings on end-</i>

192
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.638
<i>at the New Pharmacy Pub about</i>
<i>"checking out the wedding church".</i>

193
00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:39.394
Thanks for the nice chat. Reverend.
- Former reverend.

194
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:43.029
I hadn't set foot in a church
for decades.

195
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.395
Maybe it was high time to do it.

196
00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:48.995
It's high time to go for a beer.
- I see...

197
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:55.151
Can I ask one more question?
- Pray. open your soul. my child.

198
00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.713
What do you believe in?
- Good question.

199
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.712
I don't believe in lasting love
or marriage. -

200
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.156
nor in eternal life or
reincarnation. There's one thing -

201
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:09.558
that makes the cash register ring
in any religious sect. - What?

202
00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:15.192
Death. Whether due to old age.
illness. an accident or a crime-

203
00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.669
or even to taking one's own life. -

204
00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.389
death and the fear of it
is the best merchandise ever-

205
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:23.391
in the history of mankind.

206
00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.029
We could concentrate on
living fora change.

207
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.838
<i>Jussi darling.</i>
<i>I must tend to It today.</i>

208
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.037
<i>See you In the evening. At eight?</i>

209
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.833
Sure. why not. I must tend to
some business myself.

210
00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:44.919
But after eight.
I promise I'll pick up with you.

211
00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.356
<i>I'm not a pickupl-</i> OK.

212
00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:51.638
In alphabetical order.
if you please! - This is Eino Leino.

213
00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.029
Hello! - Alphabetically.

214
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:55.837
Want to buy some books?

215
00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:02.189
What. has our loverboy-detective
robbed the city library?

216
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.949
One guy paid with books.
couldn't find any cash.

217
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.830
I see. Lack of money seems to be
quite a common phenomenon. -

218
00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:16.312
or why else would short-story writer
Luusalmi be here. doing honest work?

219
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.357
And sober even.
- It breaks my artist's heart-

220
00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.870
to see how masterpieces
of Finnish literature-

221
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:25.952
are used as means of
commercial transaction!

222
00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.714
Mind you. the author's copies
that you gave me-

223
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:33.759
are on my bookshelf with a vodka
bottle and "The Unknown Soldier" -

224
00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:37.230
and will stay there.
despite my financial situation.

225
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:42.872
Good. But I must say that it makes
my heart bleed. as a man. -

226
00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.150
to see Jussi Vares in love.

227
00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:50.598
I suggest we leave my love life
off the agenda today.

228
00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:55.279
How is this young lady of yours
anyway?

229
00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:59.796
What was her name again?
Silja? As in "The Maid Silja"?

230
00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.713
Sole. Her name is Sole.

231
00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:06.316
Jussi. how serious
is this relationship of yours?

232
00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.308
I mean it.
dump that crazy bitch. Now.

233
00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.196
I must say this is
quite an impressive collection...

234
00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.955
Linna. Waltari...
Huovinen. Haanpää...

235
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:22.638
And even a few rarer editions.

236
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.589
This was a preliminary offer.

237
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.469
I shall give my final offer
once I've examined the whole bunch.

238
00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:42.277
Sometimes selling books can be
more profitable than writing them.

239
00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.433
That's true. A high-quality book
never comes cheap.

240
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.990
Here's a hat for you. Put it on.

241
00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.991
Alanen... Good afternoon!

242
00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.548
I've been thinking lately...

243
00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.075
For quite a while. actually. -

244
00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:09.709
and I've been wanting to
tell you something.

245
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:15.875
Oh... Darling. you'd even buy me
a ring if you had the money.

246
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.990
Are you upset? -What?

247
00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.597
Are you upset?
- Why would I be upset?

248
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:35.196
I mean. I thought I
was the expert on being upset.

249
00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.513
Don't come to my place
for the night.

250
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:46.350
You don't understand women
one little bit.

251
00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:53.917
Believe me when I tell you!

252
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:57.196
Talk things through with this Sole.

253
00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:03.193
It really hurts me to see
a grown man worry himself to death.

254
00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:10.835
<i>The number you have dialled</i>
<i>is not available at present.</i>

255
00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:15.873
<i>The number you have dialled</i>
<i>is not available....</i>

256
00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:24.391
Oh. the silent treatment. The oldest
and cruellest weapon of women.

257
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.834
Three days already.

258
00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:29.630
Three days is nothing. really.

259
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:33.155
But you can't say
that you haven't been warned.

260
00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:54.635
This isn't like Sole at all.
Let's go to her apartment.

261
00:28:55.720 --> 00:29:00.236
And. if necessary...
to the police station.

262
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.028
OK. I'm getting a bit worried too.

263
00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.235
Quite a stock of drugs.

264
00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:31.074
Her purse and car keys are missing.

265
00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:34.038
Maybe she took a trip somewhere.

266
00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:36.398
Three days' newspapers.

267
00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:41.031
If Sole had taken a trip somewhere.
she would have let me know.

268
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:33.074
So you're the one who last saw
Mrs Sulavesi? - Yes. I am.

269
00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:38.349
And you are the missing person's...
- Brother.

270
00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:42.154
...person's... - Friend.

271
00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:45.073
A boyfriend? -Yeah.

272
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:50.349
Are you cohabiting?
- No. We've only just met.

273
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.712
In most of these cases.
things turn out just fine-

274
00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.711
within a few days.

275
00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:00.713
I don't see any particular reason
to overreact. - Overreact?

276
00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:05.714
She's been missing for three days!
- That's exactly what I meant.

277
00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.798
Jaska. - Jussi. hi.

278
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.992
Why don't you grab your coat
and come with us.

279
00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.912
Where? - There's a place
we want to show you.

280
00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.436
Is Ruissalo a familiar place
to you. Mr Vares?

281
00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:55.512
I think everyone in Turku
has been there.

282
00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:01.789
Well. Mr Vares...
Have you paid a visit lately?

283
00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.071
Yes I have. Mr Hautavainio.

284
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:09.197
Last week or thereabouts.
With Mrs Sulavesi.

285
00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.392
For what purpose?
- It was a daytrip.

286
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:17.315
A little bit of quality time.
including a picnic. A car ride.

287
00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:27.349
Have you been to this place before?
- Not closer than a hundred metres.

288
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.432
Is that an official statement?

289
00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:34.877
This is a preliminary interview
related to an investigation.

290
00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.077
Jaska. what's going on?
- You'll soon find out.

291
00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:43.154
But first. tell us what was
your relation to this Sole Sulavesi.

292
00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:45.556
I'm a boyfriend or something.

293
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.190
One would expect you to come up
with a more precise definition.

294
00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:54.193
Have you had any problems lately?
Any disagreements?

295
00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.512
Yes. we're having problems.
I haven't seen her in four days.

296
00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:01.234
Have you ever climbed up there?

297
00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:05.313
Do I have to spell it out for you?
No. I have not.

298
00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:10.795
What has happened? -lf we find any
residual traces of your DNA there -

299
00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.995
it will be a very bad thing for you.

300
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.753
What's happened up there? Tell me!

301
00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.158
A passer-by found the body of
Sole Sulavesi up there.

302
00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:25.109
The criminal police are
investigating this as murder.

303
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:38.114
You don't look too upset.
Do you have anything to say?

304
00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.716
You'll be treated as a person
close to a homicide victim.

305
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:50.238
For operational reasons. I can't
give details of the cause of death.

306
00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:23.236
Has the past year been profitable
for a private detective?

307
00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:26.312
You know this isn't
exactly a gold mine.

308
00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:36.436
Sole Sulavesi was a substantially
wealthy woman. Did you know that?

309
00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.559
She had a posh flat
and didn't go to work-

310
00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:41.596
but I know nothing about her money.

311
00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:45.878
With her inheritance and the
post-divorce division of property. -

312
00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:48.189
she acquired considerable property.

313
00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.954
I don't think my name
will be mentioned in her will.

314
00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:56.636
Was there anything that might have
contributed to this tragedy?

315
00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.757
Any possible threats or...

316
00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.600
She was a bit skittish at times.

317
00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.196
But she...

318
00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.676
But she never specified
those fears of hers.

319
00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.200
We had other things to do.

320
00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:34.511
OK. you can go now.

321
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.508
What did she die from?

322
00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.388
There were some residues of
fluoxetine in her blood.

323
00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:52.351
We're most likely
dealing with a homicide here.

324
00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:57.117
That's all I can say for now.

325
00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:02.558
Your alibi depends on
those two barflies.

326
00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:07.079
One more thing. Jussi...
- I know. I know.

327
00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.197
I won't leave
the economic area of Turku.

328
00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:19.320
Don't leave
the economic area of Turku.

329
00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:25.876
Sole Aurora Sulavesi.
You are dust of the earth...

330
00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:33.239
To dust you will return.

331
00:36:35.520 --> 00:36:41.436
Jesus Christ. our Saviour.
will wake you up on the last day.

332
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.788
Let us pray for the soul
of the departed.

333
00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:04.990
Mister... - Jussi. Would you consider
investigating Sole's murder for me?

334
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.998
It might be a bit too personal
a case for me.

335
00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:18.593
The police have
no line of enquiry yet.

336
00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:21.239
Two weeks. and they've made
no progress at all.

337
00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.312
Sometimes these things take time.

338
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.192
Please. think about it.

339
00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:33.515
I will. I promise. - Thanks.
See you at the memorial service.

340
00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.110
You look like you've been
to a funeral.

341
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:42.279
Maybe it's because I <i>have</i>
been to a funeral.

342
00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:44.350
Thanks.

343
00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:54.676
Jussi. our deepest condolences
on your loss.

344
00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:08.391
As a clergyman.
I would be interested to hear-

345
00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:12.313
what subjects my colleague
dealt with in his sermon.

346
00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.149
Forgiveness and sin. - Sin?

347
00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:23.676
What did the honourable reverend say
about sin? - Seemed not to like it.

348
00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.876
OK guys. wake up!
Coffee or beer? -Beer.

349
00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.836
Beer. - Coffee would be nice.

350
00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:34.555
Jussi. get up. Gotta be in Helsinki
in two hours. -

351
00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:37.438
interviewing
the Prime Minister's girlfriend.

352
00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:41.428
The ex or the new one?
- Get up. Take those with you.

353
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:43.431
Let's get going. boys.

354
00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.477
Let's look at those papers
before you leave.

355
00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:50.155
What papers? -You don't remember?

356
00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.870
The papers we studied all night
with great devotion.

357
00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.678
You said you'd tackle them
to get things off your mind.

358
00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.114
You don't remember.

359
00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:01.953
Yeah. right... those papers.

360
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:08.637
"Dear Mr Ruuhio. I return to
the subject of my previous letter."

361
00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.790
"I hope that you received it."

362
00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.951
"I have a fine collection
of newspaperclippings -

363
00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:17.555
that I have been collecting
since I last wrote to you -

364
00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:19.630
more than three weeks ago."

365
00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.870
"God will not right this wrong. -

366
00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.918
so I'm sending these to you.
Mr Journalist."

367
00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:28.629
"Please. settle the scores.
Yours. Virtanen."

368
00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:32.997
Well. it's not the TPS starting
lineup forthis football season.

369
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.912
Even I have figured out that much.

370
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:40.357
The letter was signed by "Virtanen".
no phone number or address.

371
00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:44.751
Could it have something to do
with betting?

372
00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:48.393
Match-fixing or something like that?

373
00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:52.712
If you keep your word.
that's your headache. not mine.

374
00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:56.713
What did I promise exactly?
- What did you promise me?

375
00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:01.077
You promised to find out
about this list of names.

376
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:05.835
Take all the letters. Who knows. you
may even solve the Kennedy murder.

377
00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.991
Didn't your TV journalist friend
solve it already?

378
00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.232
OK. I'll do it 'cause I promised.
Besides. I've nothing else to do.

379
00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:17.392
I'll have an expense account.
won't I? -Very funny.

380
00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:24.996
Boys. How about singing the hymn
"Jesus Is My Friend Most Precious"?

381
00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.996
Or "I Turn My Gaze
unto Heaven on High"?

382
00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:31.390
How about it?

383
00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:34.915
<i>Jesus is my...</i>
- Alanen. stop it.

384
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:40.792
<i>.... I am safe in His embrace....</i>

385
00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:48.669
<i>The thought of Sole's fate</i>
<i>filled my mind.</i>

386
00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.514
<i>I missed that strange woman.</i>

387
00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:57.999
I even blamed myself. although
there was nothing I could've done

388
00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:20.396
I've been meaning
to tell you something.

389
00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.836
I just haven't had the chance.

390
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.398
I took Sole home in my taxi
some time ago.

391
00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:32.394
She was with a man.
They had quite an awful row.

392
00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:36.348
A tall. dark-haired man?

393
00:41:36.920 --> 00:41:39.229
How come you know that?

394
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.552
Hi.

395
00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.591
No. I'm not interested at all.

396
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.835
But I'll take it anyway.

397
00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:54.116
Death in a bird-watching tower!

398
00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:59.717
<i>"Eyewitness speaks out."Goddammit.</i>
<i>The things people do for money....</i>

399
00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.712
<i>And the birdwatche rwas</i>
<i>a retired policeman.</i> -

400
00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:07.635
<i>so the eyewitness report</i>
<i>has quite a professional touch.</i>

401
00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:16.637
<i>"Had been hanged"</i>
<i>or "had hanged herself"?</i>

402
00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.194
Jaska. - Are you in Turku?

403
00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:35.034
As ordered.
- <i>I have a delicate question to ask.</i>

404
00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:40.673
Were handcuffs part of
Sole Sulavesi's standard equipment?

405
00:42:41.440 --> 00:42:45.035
In the bedroom. I mean.

406
00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.515
No. not with me.

407
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:56.996
But maybe they were with this guy
from her bedroom photo gallery.

408
00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.959
One must check everything...
- So the investigation is stuck?

409
00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:05.112
"Stuck" is one hell of an
understatement.

410
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.317
Jussi. what did you just say?

411
00:43:13.080 --> 00:43:15.548
They're in there.

412
00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:25.676
That's where they were.

413
00:43:25.880 --> 00:43:29.395
True. The glue residues
are visible to the naked eye.

414
00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:32.312
Take fingerprints. will you?

415
00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:40.233
So. a 35-year-old. long-haired.
bohemian looking guy.

416
00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:45.235
Remember anything else?
- I don't know. he was kind of...

417
00:43:45.560 --> 00:43:48.199
Hey... don't touch. - Yeah yeah.

418
00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.670
I don't know.
I just had a quick glance at them.

419
00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:56.590
He looked like a poorman's
Cristiano Ronaldo.

420
00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.275
I want to ask you something.
- Go ahead.

421
00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:03.352
You never were a real suspect.

422
00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:07.831
In murder cases. you just have to
go by the book. You know that.

423
00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:12.431
We found all sorts of stains
and residues on Sole's nightgown.

424
00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:17.436
Jussi... I should take
a sperm sample from you.

425
00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.754
I mean... I. we... You should go
and give a sperm sample.

426
00:44:23.840 --> 00:44:27.799
I read in "Alibi"
that the handcuff keys are missing.

427
00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:32.828
True. The forensics team combed
the area with a metal detector.

428
00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:36.469
And the key wasn't here either.

429
00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:40.838
The stairs to the tower
are quite high. And steep.

430
00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.471
Could it be possible that Sole
went up there voluntarily?

431
00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.279
Or maybe she was forced.

432
00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:54.993
Tell me... Did you ever have keys
to this place? -No.

433
00:44:56.960 --> 00:45:00.316
Since you're going to
dig into this case anyway. -

434
00:45:00.320 --> 00:45:04.108
let's put all our cards
on the table. How about it?

435
00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:11.110
OK. - This isn't a killing
done in a drunken rage-

436
00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:14.271
but one hell of a tricky case.

437
00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:22.353
I wonder if anyone
has thought of the possibility-

438
00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:28.669
that Sole was just a random victim
of a violent lunatic?

439
00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:30.871
I think the police are assuming -

440
00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.350
that Sole had agreed to
meet someone at the tower.

441
00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:37.512
Could you tell me something
about Sole's friends?

442
00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:40.956
Male friends or her ex-husband.

443
00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:45.474
Sakari Sulavesi
is an heir to a metal corporation.

444
00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:48.392
Sole and Sakari
got married in a hurry-

445
00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:52.279
which caused quite a hullabaloo
in the groom's family.

446
00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:54.999
What did the man look like?

447
00:45:55.680 --> 00:45:57.989
Like an ordinary guy.

448
00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.355
But he was bald.

449
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:04.395
Their marriage didn't last
too long. did it?

450
00:46:04.720 --> 00:46:09.669
A couple of years.
And the divorce was a nasty one.

451
00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:14.556
A real lawyer's dream.

452
00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.110
Sole had to go to therapy
after the divorce.

453
00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:24.359
I guess Sole wasn't the most
balanced person in the world. - No.

454
00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:30.597
Sensitive. Vulnerable.

455
00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.719
From a big brother's view.
Sole was...

456
00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.108
A dreamer.

457
00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.873
That's how I remember her.

458
00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:04.393
I'm sorry to disturb you.

459
00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:11.435
I was having a meeting here.

460
00:47:11.640 --> 00:47:14.950
So perhaps the two of you -

461
00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:20.990
might go and maintain your
bank relationship somewhere else.

462
00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:32.590
<i>I guess It wasn't the best of days</i>
<i>for Mr Petterson.</i>

463
00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:37.754
<i>And the day didn't brlng me anythlng</i>
<i>new about Sole's mystery man.</i>

464
00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:41.514
<i>I realised how little</i>
<i>anyone knew about Sole's life.</i>

465
00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:04.511
Damn it...

466
00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.359
Bloody hell...

467
00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.028
There. go and run free in the wild.

468
00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:46.996
You'll find rats everywhere!

469
00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:04.390
Thank you very much
for the information. Bye.

470
00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:08.473
I contacted Sole's ex-husband.
his present wife -

471
00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:11.119
<i>and Sole's best friend.</i>

472
00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:14.670
They all confirmed
my impression of Sole:

473
00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:17.353
<i>A moody. sensitive.</i>
<i>emotional woman-</i>

474
00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:22.559
<i>who had difficulties with her</i>
<i>relationships. and not just with me.</i>

475
00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.437
<i>What I didn't know was</i>
<i>that the bird-watching tower-</i>

476
00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.910
<i>was one of her favourite places</i>
<i>throughout her life-</i>

477
00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:33.037
<i>and she used to go there</i>
<i>since she was a little girl.</i>

478
00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:37.518
<i>Directory enquiries. good evening.</i>
- Sundown nursing home. please.

479
00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:41.833
<i>The only person I hadn't talked to</i>
<i>was Susanna Petterson.</i>

480
00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:46.357
<i>Her intensive banking discussions</i>
<i>with von Knorr-</i>

481
00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.557
<i>added a new dimension to the case.</i>

482
00:49:49.560 --> 00:49:53.838
<i>Sole had said that von Knorr</i>
<i>had harassed her too.</i>

483
00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:05.389
A pint. please.

484
00:50:05.960 --> 00:50:09.236
What would your... pussycat like?

485
00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.030
Milk. cream. sardines?

486
00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:19.031
Yeah.
- Wife left? Girlfriend left?

487
00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:22.476
Yes. I mean... no. I...

488
00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:28.313
I'm Timppa. Timo. Petterson.

489
00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.029
Timo. A beautiful name.

490
00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:36.354
Thank you. What's your name?

491
00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:40.273
Irene. - Oh. Irene...

492
00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.909
That's a lot more beautiful name...

493
00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:51.913
This is Danny. - Danny?

494
00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:05.797
Here's a life saver for you.
- Oh. thank you.

495
00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:09.789
This will bring me back to
the land of the living. I'm sure.

496
00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:17.710
Ooh... Can I buy a round
for everyone?

497
00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:22.474
Sure. but it won't cost you much.

498
00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:27.554
There's only me and those two
loveable rogues over there.

499
00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:32.315
Well. it's four pints then.
And some cream for the cat.

500
00:51:35.800 --> 00:51:39.998
What's he buying us pints for. eh?

501
00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:48.709
That gentleman
over there at the bar counter-

502
00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:52.395
wanted to buy you...
- Beers. Well. thanks a million.

503
00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.834
I guess it's good manners -

504
00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:57.877
to ask the gentleman to join us.

505
00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.837
Timo...

506
00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:10.508
Hey there. I'm Timo. - Antidote.

507
00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:15.269
Geronimo. - Excuse me?

508
00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:19.034
Geronimo.
- What's your line of business then?

509
00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:22.549
I'm in the banking field.

510
00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:26.554
Oh. I thought the vault operators
are all doing time.

511
00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:30.758
We're having my...
well. my business partner's -

512
00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:33.399
shall we say... farewell party.

513
00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:36.399
How come I don't know you?

514
00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:40.951
I thought I knew all the guys
who pull bank jobs.

515
00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:44.953
You know. there are
many sorts of bank jobs.

516
00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:51.077
Aaltonen. Einola. Taanila...
Doesn't ring a bell.

517
00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:56.188
They're not from
the "Seven Brothers" -

518
00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:00.791
nor from any other work of
Finnish fiction or drama.

519
00:53:01.040 --> 00:53:03.952
Maybe they're Soile's ex-fiancés.

520
00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:15.470
Jussi. You've never taken
any of your cases personally.

521
00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.675
Forget about Ruuhio's list-

522
00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:20.638
and help the police
with this Soile case. -

523
00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.835
otherwise you'll find no peace.

524
00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:26.992
It's <i>Sole.</i> Get it?
- Sole. Sole. Sole...

525
00:53:27.360 --> 00:53:32.275
Danny. I don't understand
why you shed so much fur.

526
00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:37.911
Well. it hasn't been easy
for you either... - Timppa.

527
00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:43.590
Be seeing you.
We'll be there at the back table.

528
00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:48.993
It's kinda our own private
business meeting room.

529
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:53.353
Yeah. maybe we'll see again.
You never know.

530
00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:01.870
Hey. Danny. Come on. eat.

531
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:07.078
It'II make your coat nice and shiny.

532
00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:18.157
I guess you're... in desperate need
of a place to stay the night.

533
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:39.952
Who's gone missing now?
- Sole's brother.

534
00:54:39.960 --> 00:54:44.829
I've been trying to reach him for
two days. -Well. he's in mourning.

535
00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:54.673
Jussi Vares.
do you have a minute? - Sure.

536
00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.277
I'll tell you things that.
for operational reasons -

537
00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:14.512
haven't been revealed to anyone.
I need your help.

538
00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:18.509
We found a bunch of hair
in Sole Sulavesi's fist.

539
00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:23.196
Similar hair were found in a car
near the bird-watching tower.

540
00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:28.593
Could the hair belong to
the guy in the photo gallery?

541
00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.909
I can't say for sure.

542
00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:35.353
Can't you take a DNA sample?
- No. we can't.

543
00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:38.473
There were no hair follicles.

544
00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.597
So far. every single clue.
every little hint. everything -

545
00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:51.239
has drawn a blank.

546
00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:08.835
Nothing to worry about.
They have keys to this place.

547
00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:12.549
They're part of the furniture.
really. - Can they be trusted?

548
00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:14.676
I trust them.

549
00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:20.073
You see. there's nothing as honest
as an honest crook.

550
00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:24.389
I need two pros
who aren't afraid of the dark-

551
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:27.153
and can keep their mouths shut
afterwards.

552
00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:31.715
Sure. But I don't take
just any kind of job nowadays.

553
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:36.555
No banks. Their security systems
are too tight.

554
00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:42.635
This hit would take place
in a more private environment.

555
00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:46.189
You mean someone's got
that much dough in their pad?

556
00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.709
Something like that.

557
00:56:48.720 --> 00:56:54.113
Oh. now I see.
Money laundering.

558
00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:58.359
The plans have been laid
and the terrain has been surveyed.

559
00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:01.670
All we need is someone
to carry out the mission.

560
00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:07.190
I dunno. I'm not in a hurry
to go back to prison...

561
00:57:07.920 --> 00:57:12.277
Yeah. Antidote's kinda retired now.

562
00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:24.918
But then again... If I can stay
more in the background. -

563
00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:26.911
then why not.

564
00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:34.031
Our pal could use a little
student grant... for his "college".

565
00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:22.830
<i>I had a guilty conscience.</i>

566
00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:26.755
<i>If I had offered</i>
<i>another kind of love for Sole. -</i>

567
00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:31.072
<i>she would still be alive. Maybe.</i>

568
00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:55.915
What a palace! - OK. Let's go
through this one more time.

569
00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.992
Geronimo ties the guy up
with cable ties-

570
00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:03.073
and makes sure
he doesn't walk for a few days.

571
00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:08.996
I get the package and Antidote
stays outside. keeping watch.

572
00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:13.830
If something goes wrong.
nobody talks aloud.

573
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.355
The bastard
may recognise my voice.

574
00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:19.956
And Geronimo's articulation...
- What?

575
00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:26.153
...articulation is quite brutal.
so it'd be easy to recognise.

576
00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:31.389
Questions?
- How much does he owe you?

577
00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:36.194
A thoroughbred mare.

578
00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:40.397
I'll go first
and you'll come after.

579
00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:45.793
Wait here for a while.
Two short whistles is the sign. - OK.

580
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.309
No...

581
01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:45.393
No. no...

582
01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.834
You never whistled then.

583
01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:10.230
The job is off. - What?

584
01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:15.150
I don't have time to explain.
Read the papers tomorrow.

585
01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.595
Now let's get the hell out of here.

586
01:01:19.160 --> 01:01:23.711
Here's something for your trouble.
so you can manage for now.

587
01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:28.669
We won't see each other for a while.
and we keep a low profile.

588
01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:31.713
This will cause a huge sensation.

589
01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:56.029
<i>... a bank manager and the</i>
<i>managing director of a nursing home.</i>

590
01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:59.396
<i>The police have arrested a man-</i>

591
01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:04.110
<i>but will not reveal his identlty</i>
<i>for operational reasons.</i>

592
01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:05.997
<i>And now. news from abroad....</i>

593
01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.835
A cop I know says that
it's a solved case. One-shot.

594
01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.151
Did they steal anything?
- Not that I know of.

595
01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:16.675
The arrested man must be
Timo Petterson.

596
01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.149
Jussi. you know him.

597
01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:22.869
Would he be capable of
such a clinical execution?

598
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.670
I only know Petterson
a little bit. but I doubt it.

599
01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:31.878
To purchase a gun and hide it in
such a short time? No way. - True.

600
01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:34.997
I heard that it was he
who called the police.

601
01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.391
I think he decided to go and say
a few well-chosen words-

602
01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.712
to the bank manager.
But the police won't think so.

603
01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:47.396
Petterson may be in custody
for quite some time.

604
01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:49.994
OK boys. let's have some news.

605
01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:53.312
And weather. - Whether or not.

606
01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.549
<i>Ruuhio's list of names</i>
<i>was still a mystery to be solved.</i>

607
01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.755
<i>It would hardly make me rich-</i>

608
01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:06.799
<i>but at least I'd have</i>
<i>somethlng else on my mind.</i>

609
01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.469
Vares. - <i>Petterson.</i>

610
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:17.956
Petterson!
Is this the famous "one call" -

611
01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:20.758
that the accused is entitled to?

612
01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:25.629
<i>You watch too much TV.</i>
<i>This is the less famous call-</i>

613
01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:29.235
<i>that the client makes</i>
<i>to his private detective-</i>

614
01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:32.198
<i>to say that he wants to meet him.</i>

615
01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:35.518
So. you're officially a free man?

616
01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:39.551
They let me out this morning.
Hautavainio said -

617
01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:43.633
that suspicion towards me
has decreased.

618
01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:47.269
Thanks to the lie detector test.
I suppose.

619
01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:52.389
Well. well. The criminal police of
Turku have entered this century.

620
01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.035
How are you feeling?

621
01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:00.875
Great. My sister's been killed.
my wife turned out to be a whore -

622
01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:04.749
and I'm accused of
murdering them both.

623
01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.514
Go on. ask.

624
01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:17.108
Did you do it?

625
01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.989
No! - What the hell were you doing
in von Knorr's garden -

626
01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.036
in the middle of the night?

627
01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:28.355
What do you think? Five letters.
b-o-z-e. - That was only four.

628
01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:34.551
I was drunk. I decided to give
the ready soup man a lesson -

629
01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:38.678
that he'd never forget.
Now I'm sober-

630
01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:42.309
and I want you to
take this case too.

631
01:04:42.320 --> 01:04:46.074
With the killer on the loose.
I'll have no peace in this town.

632
01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:49.197
The town will assign
all available men to this case -

633
01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.668
and the Police College
will send them more.

634
01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.797
Don't waste your money on this.

635
01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:59.828
I was arrested for a week.
I had plenty of time to think.

636
01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:03.035
Yes or no?

637
01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:11.870
For Sole's sake.

638
01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:26.039
SUNDOWN
NURSING HOME

639
01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:32.235
<i>My visit to Sundown came way too</i>
<i>late to help solve Sole's case.</i>

640
01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:35.551
<i>Susanna Petterson</i>
<i>saw her final sundown-</i>

641
01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.712
<i>before I had the chance to hear</i>
<i>what she thought about Sole.</i>

642
01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:43.077
<i>Although now. Susanna</i>
<i>and the "ready soup man"-</i>

643
01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:45.913
<i>as Petterson called von Knorr-</i>

644
01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.640
<i>became a case of their own.</i>

645
01:05:56.200 --> 01:05:59.431
Mr Vares? - Yes.

646
01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:06.271
We haven't been introduced. though
we have met a couple of times.

647
01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.511
My name is Maria Rodriques.

648
01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:14.079
Sundown was much more
than a work place for Susanna.

649
01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:18.551
It was her whole life. - I see.

650
01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:24.678
In a nutshell. our company provides
high quality nursing services. -

651
01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:28.116
specialising in the care of
Ionely old people-

652
01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:31.317
with diminished physical capacity...

653
01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:36.195
...but we can offer various
recreational activities-

654
01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:40.398
and forms of care
that our competitors do not provide.

655
01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:43.717
What happens now
that Susanna is dead?

656
01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:47.759
We naturally wish to
continue our operation.

657
01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:52.072
May I now ask you a question?
- Of course.

658
01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:56.995
Who commissioned you to conduct
this inquiry? -Timo Petterson.

659
01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.834
I thought so.
I just wanted to make sure.

660
01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:04.390
Did you know about
Susanna and von Knorr's affair?

661
01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.278
I was Susanna's trusted friend.

662
01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:13.870
I hope I have been of some help.
- Yes. you have. Thank you.

663
01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:17.514
Einola needs something
to calm him down.

664
01:07:17.920 --> 01:07:21.196
Sorry. I didn't realise
you had company. - Doctor!

665
01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:24.830
Erkki Sariola.
activities supervisor. - Jussi Vares.

666
01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.834
I was just leaving.
It was nice to meet you.

667
01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:34.196
<i>On rare occasions. extremely rare. -</i>

668
01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:37.715
<i>a private eye</i>
<i>gets a stroke of luck.</i>

669
01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.996
<i>Of course. I should have</i>
<i>called Hautavainio-</i>

670
01:07:41.200 --> 01:07:44.875
<i>but I decided to</i>
<i>give myself three days.</i>

671
01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:47.155
<i>I didn't want a feather in my cap. -</i>

672
01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:51.199
<i>I just wanted to bring</i>
<i>Sole's killer to justice.</i>

673
01:07:55.360 --> 01:08:01.833
<i>Erkki Antero Sariola. 38.</i>
<i>Born in Hauho.</i> -

674
01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:06.755
<i>military rank: Sergeant.</i>
<i>a qualified sports therapist.</i>

675
01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:10.116
<i>Owns 10 per cent of</i>
<i>Sundown shares.</i>

676
01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:14.193
<i>Last year's Income.</i>
<i>38.000 euros.</i>

677
01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:17.119
<i>By inference. a bachelor.</i>

678
01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:20.237
<i>Not among the keenest users</i>
<i>of stimulant substances.</i>

679
01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:23.870
<i>Appears to be an ordinary.</i>
<i>decent man.</i>

680
01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:29.031
<i>Perhaps too decent.</i>
<i>llke many othercriminals.</i>

681
01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.157
Excuse me.
could I sit down for a moment?

682
01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:03.955
We met some time ago.
- Yes. Jussi Vares.

683
01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:07.953
Yes. I remember. Sit down.
- I must confess -

684
01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:11.953
that I'd seen you
before we met at Sundown.

685
01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.954
In dozens of photos.
in Sole Sulavesi's apartment.

686
01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:21.750
Now the photos have disappeared.
How well did you know Sole?

687
01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.798
First. tell me what gives you
the right and why-

688
01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:30.874
are you probing into my
private life? - I'm a private eye.

689
01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:37.797
Sole's brother hired me.
And I knew Sole. Quite intimately.

690
01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:40.997
It's no secret
that we had a love affair-

691
01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:46.154
that lasted for a few months.
Nothing unusual in Sole's case.

692
01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.399
What ended your relationship?

693
01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:52.597
Is this really relevant?

694
01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:58.118
I did. Our relationship had
no future. so I ended it.

695
01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:04.358
Sole took lots of photos. She kept
movie tickets and restaurant bills.

696
01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:08.239
I think she had a friends book.
like little girls have.

697
01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:11.557
She even wanted
a lock of my hair.

698
01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:17.759
You know that Sole was
quite wealthy. don't you?

699
01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:23.471
Yes. I also know that
this conversation ends here.

700
01:10:26.480 --> 01:10:32.430
Jaska. I know who was the guy
in Sole's photo gallery.

701
01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:37.036
It's Erkki... - Sariola.
Erkki Antero. We checked him out.

702
01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:41.636
<i>And?-</i> He's clean as a whistle.
Not even a parking ticket.

703
01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:45.758
At the time of Sole's murder.
he was lying in hospital.

704
01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:49.237
Jussi...

705
01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:59.436
Thanks.
I'm totally stuck with Sole's case.

706
01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:03.353
And I guess I'm not the only one.
- How about the list of names?

707
01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:06.717
Still a mystery to me.
How about you. anything new?

708
01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:10.714
About crimes. nothing. But one of
our financial editors said -

709
01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:14.589
that the late bank manager
von Knorr's final countdown -

710
01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.431
had begun quite a while ago.

711
01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.398
Dubious lending practices.
credit losses...

712
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:24.873
And: The Financial Supervisory
Authority had been observing him.

713
01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:28.874
He'd been living on a knife-edge
for quite a while.

714
01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:33.073
Until death he did part.
- Amen.

715
01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:37.631
This tastes awful.
Just like old news.

716
01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:41.674
Thanks anyway. - He's funny.

717
01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:47.388
<i>In all his eagerness. Ruuhio is</i>
<i>totally intolerable half the time.</i>

718
01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:50.870
<i>But some of that eagerness</i>
<i>is contagious.</i>

719
01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:55.351
<i>The case must have</i>
<i>some economic connection.</i>

720
01:12:06.720 --> 01:12:08.995
<i>"I can't ignore this anymore."</i>

721
01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.390
<i>"These people have been made</i>
<i>the puppets of gamblers.</i> -

722
01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:17.155

723
01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:20.436
<i>Signed by Ursula Virtanen.</i>

724
01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:27.992
Business merger of
the Natunen Corporation...

725
01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.750
Calcotec inquiry is withdrawn

726
01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:38.517
Bank manager von Knorr from
the Calcotec board of managers...

727
01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:41.035
Calcotec executive Topi Penkki
gives no comment

728
01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:51.068
<i>Einola needs something</i>
<i>to calm him down.</i>

729
01:12:51.080 --> 01:12:53.150
<i>Erkkl Sarlola.-</i> Jussi Vares. hi.

730
01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.948
Could I disturb you for a moment.
despite what happened last time?

731
01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.838
I want the perpetrator caught
as much as you do-

732
01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:03.310
so how can I help you?
- <i>I have a llst of names.</i>

733
01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:09.679
Hinkkanen. Taanila. Möller...
and Anttila.

734
01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:15.159
You just listed the names of Sundown
patients. in a random order-

735
01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:18.948
but there's nothing mysterious
or strange about them.

736
01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:23.158
<i>Can you tell me how the name</i>
<i>"Virtanen "Is related to this list?</i>

737
01:13:23.160 --> 01:13:26.869
We had a patient called
Ursula Virtanen. but she is gone.

738
01:13:27.080 --> 01:13:30.550
You mean she died?
- <i>Last February. I think.</i>

739
01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:33.791
How? - In a very natural way.
she stopped breathing.

740
01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.878
Do you know anything else
about this Virtanen?

741
01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:41.955
She was an ex-chief accountant.
so she helped out at the office.

742
01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:46.148
<i>But she was so nosy that</i>
<i>Susanna had to put an end to lt.</i>

743
01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:49.676
Did Mrs Virtanen
have all her china in the cupboard?

744
01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:51.871
Absolutely. Her only problem was -

745
01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:55.668
<i>that she poked her nose</i>
<i>into otherpeople's business.</i>

746
01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:33.955
Oh God... Do you know what a
60-year-old whore's pessary-

747
01:14:33.960 --> 01:14:36.554
that's neverbeen washed
smells like?

748
01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:39.552
No. and I don't want to know.
- Neither do I.

749
01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:42.632
But I'm sure this
smells worse than that.

750
01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:44.710
Through complex arrangements. -

751
01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:48.270
they've purchased
shares of high tech companies -

752
01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.430
and sold them for a high profit.

753
01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:56.037
Apparently everything was done
in the name of Sundown patients.

754
01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:59.559
Can you tell me about
the Natunen Corporation?

755
01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:04.680
It's one of the biggest
private wholesale firms in Turku.

756
01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:07.752
It is owned by
iron lady Selma Natunen.

757
01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.796
Her background is interesting.

758
01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:13.076
I don't know what its
line ofbusiness is at the moment-

759
01:15:13.080 --> 01:15:17.551
but the company has ballooned
during the past few years.

760
01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:21.350
And I'm getting to understand why.

761
01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.675
Goddammit...

762
01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:40.350
The scheme is
so diabolically brilliant-

763
01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:42.510
that it almost hurts.

764
01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:48.318
It works like this: Von Knorr gives
Natunen some inside information -

765
01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:52.229
about stock market transactions
and business deals.

766
01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:56.718
Then Von Knorr opens... opened
some phantom accounts-

767
01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.915
in the name of Sundown patients.

768
01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:02.549
Using those accounts.
Natunen buys and sells shares -

769
01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.711
and keeps the profits for herself.

770
01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:09.077
And the contact man is this
Mr Penkki -

771
01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:11.913
for whom you left a voicemail.

772
01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:16.193
Natunen is smart enough
to use a middleman.

773
01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:21.389
So you mean that Penkki
paid commission to von Knorr-

774
01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:27.157
who operated those phantom accounts.
Right? -Yes. Yes. yes...

775
01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.034
Of course he also paid
the director of the nursing home.

776
01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:37.909
Did you know that my wife was not
only a whore but also a criminal?

777
01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:41.435
I'm really sorry.
Did you ever notice-

778
01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:45.672
that your wife had
some extra money to spend? -No.

779
01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:53.073
Well. she made those
strange art purchases...

780
01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.753
What went wrong here?

781
01:16:55.760 --> 01:17:00.311
Why did Susanna and von Knorr
have to be eliminated -

782
01:17:00.480 --> 01:17:02.914
and who did it?

783
01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.515
Man's greed knows no limits.

784
01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:08.678
Maybe they were unhappy
about their share-

785
01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:11.717
and became blackmailers.

786
01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:16.990
OK. here's the USB modem.
Connect it to your laptop -

787
01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:20.197
and send an e-mail to Mr Penkki.

788
01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:26.269
Speak of the devil...

789
01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.711
Vares.
Thanks for calling back.

790
01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.951
I've left you quite enough
messages already.

791
01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.349
<i>Tell me who you're working for.</i>

792
01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:39.558
I'm working for myself.
just to earn some money.

793
01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:43.314
<i>You won't be earning much</i>
<i>after you hear from our lawyer.</i>

794
01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:45.880
Whatever.
I'll send you an e-mail.

795
01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:48.997
Read it. then we can talk business.

796
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.151
Or you can read the e-mail
in the next issue of "Alibi" -

797
01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:55.470
or in an intranet article of
the Financial Supervisory Authority.

798
01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:59.233
What? What do you want?

799
01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:05.711
I never take the risk-

800
01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:09.474
of pulling a job in the same town
within such a short time.

801
01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:12.119
Don't call me again!

802
01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:36.998
<i>You're hurting me Help!</i>

803
01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.997
You fucking asshole.
what the hell have you done!

804
01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:01.393
Detective Pohjola is from the
Economic Crime Unit of the NBI.

805
01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.914
Jussi Vares. - Ismo Pohjola.

806
01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:12.037
Boys. I think this is
a much bigger case-

807
01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:16.318
than we've even imagined.

808
01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:20.912
This Natunen Corporation
has been involved in -

809
01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:25.550
quite a few business acquisitions
lately. - Take a look at those.

810
01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:29.030
Most importantly. there is also
a possible connection -

811
01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:33.597
to very brutal
and ruthless homicides.

812
01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:38.710
In a case like this.
a special audit of accounts -

813
01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:41.792
can be conducted
within a short timeframe.

814
01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:46.078
But a court order is needed to gain
access to the account information.

815
01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.913
And murder cases
are pretty much a mystery?

816
01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:51.913
Unfortunately.
We have no hard evidence-

817
01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.548
but if we take
Natunen and Penkki in. -

818
01:19:54.720 --> 01:19:57.678
it should loosen some tongues.

819
01:19:57.880 --> 01:20:01.919
Check those. - There is.
of course. another option.

820
01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:07.756
Mr Penkki is a fish of deep waters
and just about to swallow the bait.

821
01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:12.271
Vares here.
I sent you a few charts yesterday.

822
01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.669
You have a pen and paper?

823
01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:23.910
I'll send you two series of numbers.

824
01:20:24.560 --> 01:20:27.438
The phone number of the
Financial Supervisory Authority-

825
01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:29.749
and my account number.

826
01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:33.230
The harbour. quay 13. When?

827
01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.509
That's fine by me.

828
01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.909
You must be Vares.

829
01:21:25.400 --> 01:21:28.676
MrPenkki. You're late.

830
01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:32.037
Cut the bull.
Let's get to the point.

831
01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:36.272
Fine by me.
I don't exactly enjoy your company.

832
01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.396
The feeling is mutual.

833
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.154
I've never met a blackmailer
before. though. - Really?

834
01:21:42.160 --> 01:21:44.674
I need to find out
how much you know.

835
01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:48.316
And who you've been singing to.
- I'm no choir boy.

836
01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:53.110
Goddammit!
- Besides. I know everything.

837
01:21:57.600 --> 01:22:02.196
For your information:
There's a guy over there. -

838
01:22:02.360 --> 01:22:07.115
aiming at your head
with a sniper scope. - Oh really?

839
01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:13.077
If I raise my right hand -

840
01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:16.311
you'll no longer have a head.

841
01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.193
<i>Goodbye. served you right!</i>

842
01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:38.708
Vares! Vares!

843
01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.711
I'm OK.

844
01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:51.911
Get anything on tape? I don't
remember what I said to him.

845
01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:56.596
Yes. we did.
His threat about the sniper.

846
01:22:56.600 --> 01:22:59.717
Though I'm not sure
if it would hold up in court.

847
01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.270
I don't get it.
Why did the sniper shoot Penkki -

848
01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:06.078
if he was aiming at me?

849
01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:11.313
This case turns
stranger and stranger.

850
01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:15.916
Now we must think about
our next move.

851
01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:19.708
Let's take Natunen in.
that should soften her up.

852
01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.515
Is there any way to connect her
to those homicides?

853
01:23:24.520 --> 01:23:28.752
No. Not yet anyway. The Economic
Crime Unit will do their job-

854
01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:31.399
once we get the investigation going.

855
01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:34.676
They have their strike units ready.

856
01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:40.032
What do you say to
a little bluff for the lady?

857
01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:45.878
I think we've been bluffing
enough for today.

858
01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:51.671
No. listen. I'm sure Penkki
had his phone with him.

859
01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:55.195
Let's send Natunen a message
like: "Didn't work out. -

860
01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:59.239
more instructions needed".
or something like that. OK?

861
01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:30.599
Natunen is far too smart.

862
01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:37.315
Dead end. - Well. let's call
the Economic Crime Unit.

863
01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:42.750
Captain Hautavainio. - Lieutenant.

864
01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:45.479
You have kept me here
for an intolerably long time.

865
01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:49.036
Do you have any idea of what harm
this will do to my business?

866
01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:51.315
2 weeks is a short time
compared to life.

867
01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:54.318
And I don't care one bit
about your business!

868
01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:58.195
I have an unsolved murder case
on my desk. - I run a company.

869
01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:02.352
And all the things related to it
are on my desk. - Right.

870
01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:07.435
You have friends in high places.

871
01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:14.675
I'm going to have to let you go.

872
01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:22.875
I can't connect you to a homicide.
At least not yet.

873
01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:27.230
I'm shocked at
your simplemindedness.

874
01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:32.520
Topi Penkki was my business partner
for more than 10 years.

875
01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:37.874
It is appalling to find such
dark sides in one's friends.

876
01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:40.599
You do know how to talk.

877
01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:45.233
And cover up your tracks.

878
01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:52.028
But we'll be meeting again.

879
01:25:52.760 --> 01:25:57.914
The economic charges will be enough
to get you sentenced. Believe me.

880
01:25:58.080 --> 01:26:01.914
By the way. can you explain
why a professional killer-

881
01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:06.948
decided to shoot his employer?
- How could I have an explanation?

882
01:26:07.440 --> 01:26:13.879
18. 12.
16. 18. 15...

883
01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:40.837
<i>Yummy... You sweet little</i>
<i>sugarbaby. Let me see....</i>

884
01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:52.239
<i>You're a gorgeous lady.</i>
<i>I'm dying to get to know you better.</i>

885
01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:08.709
<i>There. done.</i>

886
01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:19.392
Good evening. Mr Stahanov.

887
01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:22.438
Commercial Councellor Natunen.
I presume.

888
01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.271
How is your business going?

889
01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:28.273
I have suffered setbacks lately.
thank you for asking. - Oh?

890
01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:32.353
You shot my dear business associate
without being commissioned to do so.

891
01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.114
You shot the wrong man!

892
01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:52.350
A Russkie is a Russkie.
even if you fry him in butter!

893
01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:57.192
Thanks to you.
the Economic Crime Unit-

894
01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:01.433
harass me day and night!
- Maybe we could discuss this...

895
01:28:01.600 --> 01:28:06.196
The time of discussions is over.
MrStahanov. -

896
01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:11.638
narcissism is a dangerous trait of
character in your profession.

897
01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:22.749
<i>Dasvldanya.</i>

898
01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:30.515
Well. if it isn't Jussi.

899
01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:35.389
Come and watch
the reality show of the year.

900
01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:40.156
We've done all the tricks available.

901
01:28:40.400 --> 01:28:42.789
This is as clear as we could get it.

902
01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:46.110
Was this filmed by
our friend Penkki? - Yes.

903
01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:50.830
From the garage roof.
His shoe prints were found there.

904
01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:53.673
What the hell was he doing there?

905
01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:57.150
And the killer
doesn't look up even once.

906
01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:59.993
Another inexplicable detail.

907
01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:03.511
Is there anything familiar
about this man?

908
01:29:03.680 --> 01:29:07.514
About his physique
or the way he walks?

909
01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:11.509
I can't say there is.
- I didn't think so.

910
01:29:11.720 --> 01:29:14.871
We sent copies to the National
Bureau of Investigation. Interpol -

911
01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:18.668
and the Border Guard.
but I doubt that it helps.

912
01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:22.469
Mrs Virtanen died quite suddenly...

913
01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:26.350
Is it hard to get permission
to reopen a grave?

914
01:29:27.080 --> 01:29:30.356
An exhumation permit is no problem.

915
01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:32.916
Thanks.

916
01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:35.798
But it would be of no use.

917
01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:40.671
Ursula Virtanen was cremated.
according to her wishes.

918
01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:47.634
I have to concede that we must
close the investigation -

919
01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:52.839
into the events leading to
the death of Sole Sulavesi.

920
01:30:04.080 --> 01:30:09.677
<i>Oh... Darling. you'd even buy me</i>
<i>a ring if you had the money.</i>

921
01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.834
<i>Are you upset?</i>

922
01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:18.674
<i>I thought I
<i>was the expert on being upset.</i></i>

923
01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:22.112
Vares. Let's go for a drive.

924
01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:40.393
I can see that you don't like
high places. Jussi.

925
01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:43.392
You could tell me why we're here.

926
01:30:43.400 --> 01:30:46.756
I don't think
it's because of the view.

927
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:08.115
I mean. think about it.
A skittish. unbalanced woman -

928
01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:11.271
who'd had two
disappointments in her life.

929
01:31:11.280 --> 01:31:14.829
First this Sariola guy. then me.

930
01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:30.313
Get it? What if she planned
it all really carefully?

931
01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:33.551
Killed herself.
but framed Sariola for murder.

932
01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.950
A bitter woman's revenge.

933
01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:39.873
Your theory would explain
that bunch of hair.

934
01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:45.919
Could you hang yourself
wearing these? -What?

935
01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:01.469
Yeah. I could do that.

936
01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.750
What if she swallowed the key?

937
01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:08.672
They did a full autopsy on her-

938
01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:11.717
and found nothing unusual
in her stomach.

939
01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:15.679
Just some residuals of medicine.

940
01:32:15.680 --> 01:32:18.877
She loved to feed animals.
she did it often.

941
01:32:18.880 --> 01:32:23.670
What if she threw the key away
and a magpie took it?

942
01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:28.196
Even if we found the key. it should
only have Sole's fingerprints on it.

943
01:32:28.200 --> 01:32:31.272
If you think that the police
have the resources to check-

944
01:32:31.280 --> 01:32:34.431
every goddamn magpie nest
of Southwest Finland. -

945
01:32:34.440 --> 01:32:38.479
you're either drunk
or crazy or both.

946
01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:40.630
This isn't easy for me either.

947
01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:44.838
I have four unsolved homicides
on my desk.

948
01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:48.390
The theory of Sole's suicide
is possible-

949
01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:52.029
but there's no way to prove it.

950
01:32:52.040 --> 01:32:57.353
This is the toughest case
of my career. I can tell you.

951
01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:03.230
And it's not hard to admit that all
the lines of enquiry are blocked.

952
01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:06.198
It hurts my professional pride.

953
01:33:06.560 --> 01:33:11.554
There was no way
I could've saved her. -I guess not.

954
01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:16.350
And I couldn't bring the culprit
to justice. for that matter.

955
01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:20.672
Well. I'm glad that murder never
expires. - Yeah. but Jaska. we do.

956
01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:33.073
Cat food

957
01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:47.710
Congratulations... - Cheers!

958
01:33:47.880 --> 01:33:51.668
To the happily engaged couple!
- Congratulations and...

959
01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:55.399
A kiss. - Hey. good idea!

960
01:33:55.560 --> 01:33:59.553
A kiss.
- For the mother-in-law...

961
01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:05.073
On my behalf. I want to
congratulate the happy couple.

962
01:34:05.080 --> 01:34:08.152
A kiss!
- Hey. this one's on Geronimo.

963
