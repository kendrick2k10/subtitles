Do you know how lucky I am

30
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.266
to get a sublet in the West
Village of New York City

31
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.000
on my budget?

32
00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:02.400
Without six roommates and a bed
that folds into the wall.

33
00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:04.633
But honey. that apartment
belongs to a stranger you met

34
00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:06.133
on the internet.

35
00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:08.900
She's not a stranger.
We talked about this.

36
00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:11.266
My friend Abbie posted that her
friend Amelia was looking

37
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.600
for someone to sublet.

38
00:02:12.734 --> 00:02:14.767
I met her over Zoom
and she seems very nice.

39
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.834
And what if something
goes wrong?

40
00:02:15.967 --> 00:02:17.467
What if a pipe bursts?

41
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.100
Besides. Amelia left me
an entire checklist

42
00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:24.433
for the apartment in case
anything goes wrong.

43
00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:26.633
We just don't understand why
you had to leave Omaha

44
00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:28.600
and move halfway
across the country.

45
00:02:28.734 --> 00:02:31.300
Because it's time that I get
out on my own.

46
00:02:31.433 --> 00:02:32.734
What about work?

47
00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:34.800
A steady job and
a steady career.

48
00:02:34.934 --> 00:02:37.266
I have an appointment about
that very thing this afternoon.

49
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.100
So. I gotta go.

50
00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:40.967
We love you.

51
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.667
Just call us. alright?
Just keep us posted. ok?

52
00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.000
I love you. sweetheart.

53
00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:47.934
Love you too.
Gotta go. bye.

54
00:02:59.433 --> 00:03:00.467
Oh.

55
00:03:07.333 --> 00:03:10.467
Well. I have got
to go. My 1:00 is starting.

56
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.467
It's 1:30 Mom.
and who's counting?

57
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.567
Austin.
Wonderful to see you.

58
00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:22.233
Hi. We are both gonna have
the Kale Caesar.

59
00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:23.567
I was gonna get
the chicken sandwich.

60
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.834
Nonsense.

61
00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:27.400
It is my favorite salad
in the city.

62
00:03:28.433 --> 00:03:29.967
So. what's the occasion?

63
00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.000
You know it's not
my birthday. right?

64
00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:35.533
The Paley Center is hosting
a retrospective

65
00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:38.166
to celebrate my 40 years
in the news business.

66
00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.633
And I want to inspire the next
generation of journalists.

67
00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:44.133
I'll add it to my calendar.

68
00:03:44.266 --> 00:03:46.567
Well. I want you to do more
than that.

69
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.400
They're honoring my legacy.
which includes you as well

70
00:03:51.533 --> 00:03:53.800
and so naturally there will be
some questions

71
00:03:53.934 --> 00:03:56.166
about your current. um...

72
00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:00.400
Career status.

73
00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:04.800
I have arranged an interview for
you at the New York Chronicle .

74
00:04:04.934 --> 00:04:07.300
Mom. no. we've been over this
countless times.

75
00:04:07.433 --> 00:04:10.100
It's not what I want for myself.
I'm making my own way.

76
00:04:10.233 --> 00:04:11.734
By doing what? Tutoring?

77
00:04:11.867 --> 00:04:13.200
It's a means to an end.

78
00:04:13.333 --> 00:04:15.400
I saved up enough money
so I can focus on writing.

79
00:04:15.533 --> 00:04:17.066
Children's fairy tales.

80
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.967
Books. Mom.

81
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:20.900
I want to write exciting
and adventurous books

82
00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:22.400
for a young audience.

83
00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:24.900
Isn't that inspiring
the next generation too?

84
00:04:25.033 --> 00:04:27.400
Honey. you have
so much potential.

85
00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:28.900
You are smart.

86
00:04:29.033 --> 00:04:32.100
You have a degree in journalism
from Northwestern.

87
00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:34.066
Did you even read the pages
I sent you?

88
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.567
Oh. wow.

89
00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.133
That looks absolutely marvelous.

90
00:04:38.266 --> 00:04:40.367
They're just salads. Mom.

91
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.934
And it is just a meeting. Austin.

92
00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:45.700
The editor is an old friend
of mine.

93
00:04:45.834 --> 00:04:47.700
He's... he's expecting you.

94
00:04:49.867 --> 00:04:53.900
If I do this interview.
will you promise to drop it?

95
00:04:54.033 --> 00:04:55.033
Yes.

96
00:04:56.066 --> 00:04:59.934
Fine. I'll do it. but I'm not
gonna like it.

97
00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.600
Just like this salad.

98
00:05:06.633 --> 00:05:08.600
So what are
your job goals?

99
00:05:08.734 --> 00:05:11.700
I came here to figure out what
I want to do with my life.

100
00:05:11.834 --> 00:05:15.767
Well that is about as honest
an answer as I've ever heard.

101
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.834
Let's start with
your work history.

102
00:05:17.967 --> 00:05:21.033
Um. for the past seven years

103
00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:24.200
I've worked for my dad's patio
furniture company back home.

104
00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:26.000
And why did you quit?

105
00:05:26.133 --> 00:05:30.367
I realized I'm about to turn 30
and I was living the life

106
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.433
that my parents wanted for me.

107
00:05:32.567 --> 00:05:34.266
but not the life that I wanted
for myself

108
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.367
and I knew that if I stayed

109
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.667
I would never get up the courage
to get out on my own.

110
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.133
So. I quit my job and I gave up
my apartment

111
00:05:45.266 --> 00:05:47.166
and I moved to New York City.

112
00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.633
That's gutsy.

113
00:05:48.767 --> 00:05:50.800
I'm sure we can find work
for you pretty quickly.

114
00:05:50.934 --> 00:05:52.700
I know you see a lot of people

115
00:05:52.834 --> 00:05:54.800
who are just looking
for temp jobs

116
00:05:54.934 --> 00:05:56.834
but I really want more
than that.

117
00:05:56.967 --> 00:05:59.600
- Mmmhmm.
- I figure temping is
my best shot

118
00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.400
at trying out a lot of
different careers.

119
00:06:02.533 --> 00:06:04.900
And you're at the center
at the job market.

120
00:06:05.033 --> 00:06:08.233
I want to work with you
to find my calling.

121
00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:09.333
Well. that's a first.

122
00:06:09.467 --> 00:06:11.734
I would love to work
with you.

123
00:06:11.867 --> 00:06:13.600
Any particular field you'd like
to start with?

124
00:06:13.734 --> 00:06:15.266
I am flexible.

125
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.000
I mean. New York is full of
possibilities. right?

126
00:06:18.133 --> 00:06:21.333
Alright. Well. let's see
what we've got.

127
00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:27.500
We just got an opening this
afternoon for a fashion show.

128
00:06:27.633 --> 00:06:29.367
Great. Sign me up.

129
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.600
Ok.

130
00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.867
This is Isabella Demark's

131
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.166
most important fashion show
of the year.

132
00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.667
You are to be seen
and not heard.

133
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:41.667
is that understood?

134
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:42.867
Understood.

135
00:06:45.333 --> 00:06:47.400
Oh. seen. not heard.
Right. right.

136
00:06:47.533 --> 00:06:49.333
Um. I do have one question.

137
00:06:49.467 --> 00:06:52.567
When do we get to see
the collection?

138
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.934
None of you are to go anywhere
near the runway.

139
00:06:56.066 --> 00:06:58.767
the models or the couture.

140
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.166
I'm just curious. you know. are
we talking like classic staples

141
00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.133
or is it more like futuristic
and impractical pieces?

142
00:07:09.266 --> 00:07:11.400
I mean. that would be my vote.

143
00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:17.066
You hand out press passes.
You set up chairs.

144
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.300
You. pick up the order
from Juice Boost.

145
00:07:19.433 --> 00:07:21.834
Um. what's that?

146
00:07:21.967 --> 00:07:24.967
A micro metrics raw juice bar.
Downtown on Great Jones Street.

147
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:27.166
Here is the address
and the orders.

148
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.934
I need these exact and
I need them by 3:00PM.

149
00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:31.567
Don't be late.

150
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.233
Uh. right. I was thinking I...

151
00:07:35.367 --> 00:07:37.600
Is there a problem?

152
00:07:37.734 --> 00:07:41.300
No. No. I am... I am just
grateful to be here.

153
00:07:41.433 --> 00:07:42.934
You should be.

154
00:07:43.066 --> 00:07:45.066
3:00PM. I won't be late.

155
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.333
Actually. I will be early.

156
00:07:49.533 --> 00:07:51.166
Do you know the best way
to get...

157
00:07:59.767 --> 00:08:02.900
Austin. Alan Sandler.
Thanks so much for waiting.

158
00:08:03.033 --> 00:08:04.233
Busy day here?

159
00:08:04.367 --> 00:08:05.867
News never stops. does it?

160
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.633
Which is why I don't want to
take up too much of your time.

161
00:08:07.767 --> 00:08:09.000
My thoughts exactly.

162
00:08:09.133 --> 00:08:10.900
We're thrilled that
you're joining the team.

163
00:08:11.033 --> 00:08:13.066
Joining the team?

164
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.333
We'll start you on features
first thing tomorrow morning.

165
00:08:15.467 --> 00:08:16.867
I thought this was
an interview.

166
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.533
This is you.

167
00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:21.233
When Patricia calls and tells us
to give her son a job.

168
00:08:21.367 --> 00:08:22.200
we listen.

169
00:08:22.333 --> 00:08:23.367
Must be a big relief.

170
00:08:23.500 --> 00:08:24.500
I wish I had those kinds
of connections

171
00:08:24.633 --> 00:08:26.233
when I was coming up.

172
00:08:27.266 --> 00:08:29.033
Don't you want to see
if I'm the right fit?

173
00:08:29.166 --> 00:08:30.133
If you're anything
like your mother.

174
00:08:30.266 --> 00:08:31.734
you're gonna fit right in.

175
00:08:38.667 --> 00:08:40.133
Taxi!

176
00:08:40.266 --> 00:08:41.233
Taxi.

177
00:08:45.133 --> 00:08:47.233
- Hey. that's my cab!
- It's my taxi.

178
00:08:49.467 --> 00:08:51.734
Glad to know chivalry
is alive and well!

179
00:08:54.967 --> 00:08:56.000
Taxi!

180
00:08:57.834 --> 00:08:59.000
Taxi!

181
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.467
I know I'm late but this jerk
stole my cab

182
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:06.433
and proved that chivalry
is dead.

183
00:09:06.567 --> 00:09:08.700
Gone. caput.

184
00:09:08.834 --> 00:09:10.300
Did you know where I'm supposed
to put these?

185
00:09:12.433 --> 00:09:13.800
And you are not a person.

186
00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.467
Oh... I can... I can... I can
clean this.

187
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.066
Um. does anybody have any
club soda? Or uh... or um...

188
00:10:30.667 --> 00:10:37.400
Nathan the Squirrel stood
atop the pinnacle

189
00:10:37.533 --> 00:10:39.967
of the Empire State Building.

190
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.967
with his little pair
of flying shoes.

191
00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:52.467
But. the only thing he wanted
was to come back safely

192
00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.800
to the ground.

193
00:11:00.233 --> 00:11:02.033
Ok. that's how you want
to play it. huh?

194
00:11:03.467 --> 00:11:04.767
Ok. Ok.

195
00:11:07.467 --> 00:11:09.166
Let's see... Radiator.

196
00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.934
"Turn valve all the way
to the left." Check.

197
00:11:13.066 --> 00:11:15.266
"Kick twice for good luck."

198
00:11:16.867 --> 00:11:17.767
Ok.

199
00:11:23.767 --> 00:11:26.533
Ha. ha! Victory is mine.

200
00:11:28.467 --> 00:11:30.033
"And one last thing.

201
00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:32.600
"if the guy across the hall is
looking for me. tell him..."

202
00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.934
Oh. You're not Amelia.

203
00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:42.667
Wait. you're the guy
who stole my taxi.

204
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.033
What? That wasn't your taxi.
I flagged it.

205
00:11:46.166 --> 00:11:48.967
Yeah. for me.
I assumed you were being nice.

206
00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.433
Well you're clearly
not from New York.

207
00:11:50.567 --> 00:11:51.967
I just moved here.

208
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.000
I'm subletting for Amelia
for the next two months.

209
00:11:54.133 --> 00:11:55.967
Two months?
Where'd she go?

210
00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.000
Uh. work trip in Japan
and then traveling.

211
00:11:59.133 --> 00:12:02.500
I'm sure you'll see it
all over her feed.

212
00:12:02.633 --> 00:12:06.667
Wait a minute.
9:00PM. a bottle of wine?

213
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:08.567
I know what this is.

214
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.734
And I'm gonna go back across
the hall to my apartment now.

215
00:12:10.867 --> 00:12:12.266
Mmhm.

216
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:15.100
Goodnight!

217
00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.767
You again?

218
00:12:24.867 --> 00:12:26.367
Oh. you're the guy across
the hall.

219
00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:28.900
- Amelia left a message for you.
- She did?

220
00:12:29.033 --> 00:12:30.834
Uh. "Dear Austin." is that you?

221
00:12:30.967 --> 00:12:32.367
One and the same.

222
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:34.367
"I think you're great and we
always have fun together

223
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:36.700
"but I think it's time
we move on."

224
00:12:36.834 --> 00:12:38.367
Oh. I think she's breaking
up with you.

225
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.567
Yeah. thanks for making
that clear

226
00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.333
but we weren't actually dating.

227
00:12:41.467 --> 00:12:43.100
"I know we weren't
actually dating."

228
00:12:43.233 --> 00:12:45.767
Well. at least you two were on
the same page about something.

229
00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:47.233
"And that's the problem.

230
00:12:47.367 --> 00:12:49.367
"I'm ready for a relationship
but not with you.

231
00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:50.600
"I need someone who's
more serious

232
00:12:50.734 --> 00:12:51.900
"about their direction..."

233
00:12:52.033 --> 00:12:53.333
You don't have to keep reading.

234
00:12:53.467 --> 00:12:54.700
But I've never broken up
with somebody

235
00:12:54.834 --> 00:12:56.700
on behalf of somebody else before.

236
00:12:56.834 --> 00:12:57.767
You having fun?

237
00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.100
A little.

238
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:06.433
I'm sorry. who are you exactly
and why are you here?

239
00:13:06.567 --> 00:13:09.967
I'm Piper and I came here
to figure out my calling

240
00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:11.333
and make something of myself.

241
00:13:12.767 --> 00:13:13.934
Why are you laughing?

242
00:13:14.066 --> 00:13:15.900
That's cute.
No. no reason.

243
00:13:16.033 --> 00:13:19.000
I just didn't know people
actually used phrases like that.

244
00:13:19.133 --> 00:13:20.633
I'm sure it'll all work out
for you.

245
00:13:20.767 --> 00:13:22.900
It will. Thank you.

246
00:13:23.033 --> 00:13:24.500
- Good night.
- Good night!

247
00:13:26.967 --> 00:13:27.934
Ok.

248
00:13:33.734 --> 00:13:34.667
Ok. so this is really
bugging me

249
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.400
so I have to ask.

250
00:13:36.533 --> 00:13:38.500
What's your master plan for
the two months you're here?

251
00:13:38.633 --> 00:13:39.834
I signed up with
a temp agency.

252
00:13:39.967 --> 00:13:40.834
That's your plan?

253
00:13:40.967 --> 00:13:42.266
Yeah. I had my first job today.

254
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.400
And how'd it go?

255
00:13:43.533 --> 00:13:44.600
Hm. fashion isn't really
my thing.

256
00:13:44.734 --> 00:13:46.233
Let me see if I got this right.

257
00:13:46.367 --> 00:13:48.400
You gave yourself two months
to find your passion

258
00:13:48.533 --> 00:13:50.100
and then make it
but you don't even know

259
00:13:50.233 --> 00:13:51.266
what field that'll be in

260
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.300
and the first job you tried
fired you?

261
00:13:53.433 --> 00:13:54.800
I didn't say fired.

262
00:13:54.934 --> 00:13:56.400
You didn't have to.

263
00:13:57.467 --> 00:13:59.934
You seem like a nice.
if slightly deluded person

264
00:14:00.133 --> 00:14:02.700
so I'm just gonna tell you
straight up.

265
00:14:02.834 --> 00:14:04.867
Success isn't all
it's cracked up to be.

266
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.834
Hm. New Yorkers really
are opinionated.

267
00:14:07.967 --> 00:14:09.867
It's not an opinion.
it's a fact.

268
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.233
I've seen the inner circle.

269
00:14:11.367 --> 00:14:13.200
That must be nice.

270
00:14:13.333 --> 00:14:15.700
But. for the rest of us. we
have to take what we can get.

271
00:14:15.834 --> 00:14:16.734
So. thank you.

272
00:14:16.867 --> 00:14:17.734
For what?

273
00:14:17.867 --> 00:14:19.133
The wine.

274
00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.333
You're welcome.

275
00:15:22.667 --> 00:15:24.166
Pumpkin bread?

276
00:15:24.300 --> 00:15:25.300
Enjoy it.

277
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.200
Would you like to try some
seasonal pumpkin bread?

278
00:15:29.333 --> 00:15:32.066
Oh. uh. sure.
Thank you.

279
00:15:36.166 --> 00:15:38.066
This is really good.

280
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.867
Have you tried this
pumpkin bread?

281
00:15:41.533 --> 00:15:43.233
Maybe she's more of an apple
crumble person.

282
00:15:44.834 --> 00:15:45.934
Did you make this?

283
00:15:46.066 --> 00:15:47.567
No. that would be my husband. Toby.

284
00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:48.867
You should come in
and meet him.

285
00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.900
Your efforts have certainly
earned you

286
00:15:50.033 --> 00:15:51.567
a coffee on the house.

287
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:52.700
Wow. ok.

288
00:15:52.834 --> 00:15:53.900
Follow me.

289
00:15:55.867 --> 00:15:57.800
So. what lucky gust of wind
dropped you on our doorstep

290
00:15:57.934 --> 00:15:59.600
like Marlo Thomas
in "That Girl"

291
00:15:59.734 --> 00:16:01.667
'cause you are clearly not
from around here?

292
00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:03.367
Don't let Will fool you.

293
00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:06.767
He tumbled out of a Greyhound
bus too and never looked back.

294
00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:08.433
Where from?

295
00:16:08.567 --> 00:16:10.967
A part of Wisconsin you've
never heard of and never will.

296
00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:12.800
He's put that part of his life
behind him.

297
00:16:12.934 --> 00:16:14.934
I simply reinvented myself.

298
00:16:15.066 --> 00:16:15.967
It's a great thing
about this city.

299
00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.367
you can just start over.

300
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.500
And become the person
you were meant to be.

301
00:16:19.633 --> 00:16:21.367
That's exactly why I'm here.

302
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:24.033
To figure out who
I'm meant to be.

303
00:16:24.166 --> 00:16:26.800
I'm Piper and you two
are officially

304
00:16:26.934 --> 00:16:29.000
my new favorite people.

305
00:16:29.133 --> 00:16:32.467
You must be Toby.
I love the pumpkin bread.

306
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.000
Welcome to the Keystone Café.

307
00:16:34.133 --> 00:16:35.767
Yeah. we actually opened
the café as a refuge

308
00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:37.367
for anyone new to the city.

309
00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.467
We know what it's like
to move here on your own.

310
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.800
Usually with parents back home
who don't understand

311
00:16:41.934 --> 00:16:44.166
and don't approve.

312
00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.533
Am I wearing a sign
or something?

313
00:16:46.667 --> 00:16:48.467
How did you know?

314
00:16:48.600 --> 00:16:50.467
Oh. just one of my many
mysterious gifts.

315
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:53.367
Coming up. my special
pumpkin spice latte.

316
00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.000
Why don't you go take a seat
and I'll bring it right over.

317
00:16:56.133 --> 00:16:57.100
Thanks.

318
00:17:05.166 --> 00:17:07.333
Austin. what a surprise.

319
00:17:07.467 --> 00:17:09.266
I could say the same thing.

320
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.567
A job offer at the New York
Chronicle really?

321
00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:12.867
Some interview.

322
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.567
Well. I knew you wouldn't
go otherwise.

323
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.867
I am interviewing the secretary
of the UN.

324
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.500
You could be doing important
work like that too.

325
00:17:21.633 --> 00:17:23.734
Fictional stories provide
an escape.

326
00:17:23.867 --> 00:17:25.934
Entertainment.
Inspiration.

327
00:17:26.066 --> 00:17:30.233
That can be just as important
a public service as journalism.

328
00:17:30.367 --> 00:17:32.033
I'm not taking the job. Mom.

329
00:17:36.867 --> 00:17:39.233
Ah. do we have an artist
in our midst?

330
00:17:39.367 --> 00:17:43.166
No. It's just a silly hobby.

331
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.200
Coffee. Toby. black.

332
00:17:45.333 --> 00:17:48.500
Furthest reaches
of the galaxy black.

333
00:17:48.633 --> 00:17:51.734
You saw your mother. I take it?
Need a shot of whiskey instead?

334
00:17:51.867 --> 00:17:53.033
Don't get my hopes up.

335
00:17:53.166 --> 00:17:54.433
I know you don't have
a liquor license.

336
00:17:58.033 --> 00:17:59.200
What's this?

337
00:17:59.333 --> 00:18:00.433
First. you move in across
the hall

338
00:18:00.567 --> 00:18:02.633
and now you move in
on my favorite café?

339
00:18:02.767 --> 00:18:05.433
Oh. I must have missed your name
on the door.

340
00:18:05.567 --> 00:18:06.900
Wait. you two know each other?

341
00:18:07.033 --> 00:18:08.400
Yeah. we're temporary neighbors.

342
00:18:08.533 --> 00:18:10.900
Wait. how are you both
so buddy-buddy.

343
00:18:11.033 --> 00:18:13.100
It took months for Will and Toby
to warm up to me.

344
00:18:13.233 --> 00:18:14.467
That's because you're always
giving off

345
00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.800
total curmudgeon vibes.

346
00:18:15.934 --> 00:18:18.233
I doubt curmudgeon
is the right word.

347
00:18:18.367 --> 00:18:20.400
Holed up writing
your book all day.

348
00:18:20.533 --> 00:18:22.633
A grunt of acknowledgement
when I call your order.

349
00:18:22.767 --> 00:18:23.934
You're a writer?

350
00:18:24.066 --> 00:18:25.467
Working on it.

351
00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:28.567
But as of an hour ago.
I'm apparently a journalist.

352
00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.333
My mother got the New York
Chronicle to offer me a job.

353
00:18:31.467 --> 00:18:33.767
Your mother must be
very important.

354
00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.900
His mother is Patricia Edwards.

355
00:18:36.033 --> 00:18:38.133
Your mother is
Patricia Edwards?

356
00:18:38.266 --> 00:18:43.266
As in the famous journalist?
I mean. she's kind of a legend.

357
00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.000
Yeah. I guess she is.

358
00:18:45.133 --> 00:18:46.767
Well. you're not gonna take
the job. are you?

359
00:18:46.900 --> 00:18:48.467
What if I did?

360
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.667
But you always fought
to carve your own path?

361
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:52.667
I can't keep hoping she'll come
around to that.

362
00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:54.133
Maybe it's time for
a new strategy.

363
00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:55.266
Austin.

364
00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:56.900
Go with me here.

365
00:18:57.033 --> 00:18:59.233
I could do the bare minimum
and cash a good paycheck.

366
00:18:59.367 --> 00:19:01.166
All while secretly working
on my book.

367
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:04.667
Wait a minute. so you plan
on taking a good job

368
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.867
with the intent to do
a bad job?

369
00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.166
Yep.

370
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.000
I think you might regret that.

371
00:19:11.133 --> 00:19:12.367
And how is your job hunt going?

372
00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:15.867
Have you found your passion
and made it yet?

373
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.066
Not yet. but I will rub it in
your face when I do.

374
00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.834
She actually has a new job at
the Uptown Museum in New York.

375
00:19:23.967 --> 00:19:26.900
Austin. why don't you show her
how to get to the right subway?

376
00:19:27.033 --> 00:19:28.200
Good idea.

377
00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:31.500
She'd undoubtedly get
lost otherwise.

378
00:19:31.633 --> 00:19:34.467
There's nothing wrong with
getting lost along the way.

379
00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.734
That's how you stumble
upon the best things.

380
00:19:41.967 --> 00:19:43.333
In a hurry?

381
00:19:43.467 --> 00:19:44.800
No. why?

382
00:19:44.934 --> 00:19:46.066
How can you appreciate
everything around you

383
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.633
when you rush right by it?

384
00:19:47.767 --> 00:19:49.300
What's there to see?

385
00:19:49.433 --> 00:19:53.000
Oh! Who has the
cutest little sweater. huh?

386
00:19:53.133 --> 00:19:55.233
And the floppies little ears. huh?

387
00:19:57.667 --> 00:19:59.567
Yeah?

388
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.867
Don't you have some place
to be?

389
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.500
Yes. but I can take in

390
00:20:05.633 --> 00:20:08.367
all the beautiful sights of
the city on the way.

391
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:13.367
Like. look at these leaves.
Marvelous color.

392
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:16.967
Doesn't it make you just want
to curl up in a cozy flannel?

393
00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:18.967
No. makes me want to tell
the residents

394
00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.367
to sweep their sidewalks.

395
00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.533
Does New York really
hold no magic for you?

396
00:20:25.667 --> 00:20:28.800
In the fantasy of my mind
and the stories I write.

397
00:20:28.934 --> 00:20:30.333
Not in real life.

398
00:20:30.467 --> 00:20:32.500
So then why do you live here?

399
00:20:32.633 --> 00:20:34.400
Because New York's the greatest
city in the world.

400
00:20:36.767 --> 00:20:38.033
I thought you just said...

401
00:20:38.166 --> 00:20:42.200
I'm a New Yorker.
I'm supposed to hate everything.

402
00:20:42.333 --> 00:20:43.500
Yeah. when you're ready
to go to work.

403
00:20:43.633 --> 00:20:45.967
the subway's just straight up
that way.

404
00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:48.033
Unless of course you get
distracted romanticizing

405
00:20:48.166 --> 00:20:50.000
a sewer grate.

406
00:20:50.133 --> 00:20:52.567
You never know what wonders
lie beneath our feet.

407
00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:53.734
Have a good day!

408
00:20:53.867 --> 00:20:55.100
You too.

409
00:21:08.033 --> 00:21:10.533
As an attendant. you'll have
to answer any visitor questions

410
00:21:10.667 --> 00:21:12.166
and provide directions.

411
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.667
So. please familiarize yourself
with the layout.

412
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.367
Must be so exciting
working here.

413
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.367
Surrounded by all this.
you know. history and culture.

414
00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:21.467
Indeed.

415
00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.800
We don't allow food. drinks

416
00:21:22.934 --> 00:21:24.834
and definitely no touching
the collection.

417
00:21:24.967 --> 00:21:26.233
Hopefully you won't
be confronted

418
00:21:26.367 --> 00:21:29.000
with too many field trips
of rowdy school children.

419
00:21:29.133 --> 00:21:31.133
Well. if I have to defend
myself at least I know

420
00:21:31.266 --> 00:21:33.667
where the ancient
battle shields are.

421
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:35.400
That was a joke.

422
00:21:35.533 --> 00:21:39.033
Funny.
Let's get you a name tag.

423
00:21:39.166 --> 00:21:40.633
Great.

424
00:21:53.133 --> 00:21:54.500
Not a fan of museums?

425
00:21:54.633 --> 00:21:56.066
Huh?

426
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.467
Well. I just... I noticed
you glued to your phone.

427
00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.734
There's nothing here that's
piquing your interest?

428
00:22:02.867 --> 00:22:08.367
No. my mom made us come.
Most boring vacation ever.

429
00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.266
Where would you rather
have gone?

430
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.567
Hawaii. to surf.

431
00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:17.700
Surfing. that's fun.
But aren't you afraid of sharks?

432
00:22:17.834 --> 00:22:21.066
No. I love them.
They're so awesome.

433
00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:23.867
Oh. Well then you should
check out our third floor

434
00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.934
because we have a huge
shark exhibit.

435
00:22:26.066 --> 00:22:26.934
Are there hammerheads?

436
00:22:27.066 --> 00:22:27.934
Uh-huh.

437
00:22:28.066 --> 00:22:28.934
What about great whites?

438
00:22:29.066 --> 00:22:30.567
Oh yeah. Definitely.

439
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:32.633
I'm sorry. is my son
bothering you?

440
00:22:32.767 --> 00:22:35.300
Mom! She said there's
a shark exhibit.

441
00:22:35.433 --> 00:22:37.600
We have to go.

442
00:22:37.734 --> 00:22:40.266
Thank you.
I was beginning to lose hope.

443
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.567
I practically had
to drag him here.

444
00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:44.734
My pleasure.

445
00:22:44.867 --> 00:22:46.233
Uh. you can take the elevators
on the left.

446
00:22:46.367 --> 00:22:48.567
Third floor.
Can't miss it.

447
00:22:50.667 --> 00:22:53.200
Austin. let's hit
the ground running.

448
00:22:53.333 --> 00:22:56.033
We're doing a piece on the
founder of a new tech startup.

449
00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:58.300
Why don't you take the lead
on this?

450
00:22:58.433 --> 00:22:59.600
It's not really my scene.

451
00:23:00.934 --> 00:23:02.767
It's not really how things work.

452
00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:07.667
Ok. I'll get it to you
by the end of the week.

453
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.433
More like tomorrow. Austin.
News moves fast.

454
00:23:12.667 --> 00:23:14.600
But you're your mother's son.
you can handle it. right?

455
00:23:16.467 --> 00:23:17.467
Sure.

456
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.166
I'm gonna need a bit
more enthusiasm

457
00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.266
than that around here.

458
00:23:34.633 --> 00:23:37.934
Piper! You've received
excellent remarks

459
00:23:38.066 --> 00:23:39.300
on the visitor cards
left behind.

460
00:23:39.433 --> 00:23:41.333
That's so nice.

461
00:23:41.467 --> 00:23:43.834
Does it correspond
to any kind of perks?

462
00:23:43.967 --> 00:23:47.266
Because I have had my eye
on Cleopatra's bracelet.

463
00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.967
No perks. but it does come
with an offer.

464
00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:51.033
The department is looking for

465
00:23:51.166 --> 00:23:52.867
a new visitor relations supervisor.

466
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.300
I'd like to recommend you
for the job.

467
00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:55.433
Oh.

468
00:23:55.567 --> 00:23:57.000
It's a full-time position.

469
00:23:57.133 --> 00:23:58.333
Not one that opens up
here too often.

470
00:23:58.467 --> 00:23:59.867
Are you interested?

471
00:24:02.533 --> 00:24:05.433
You turned the job down?
Why?

472
00:24:05.567 --> 00:24:07.867
I don't know. it just...

473
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.533
Wasn't the right fit?

474
00:24:09.667 --> 00:24:10.767
Exactly.

475
00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.166
Any idea what the right fit
might be?

476
00:24:13.300 --> 00:24:18.667
It's a gut feeling.
I'll know it when I see it.

477
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.433
Ok. Piper.

478
00:24:20.567 --> 00:24:23.734
But you told me that
you only have two months.

479
00:24:23.867 --> 00:24:25.667
At some point. you're going
to have to figure out

480
00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:27.867
what it is that you want.

481
00:24:42.533 --> 00:24:44.333
- After you.
- After you.

482
00:24:44.467 --> 00:24:45.834
Go frolic in the leaf piles

483
00:24:45.967 --> 00:24:47.934
before I kick them
out of the way.

484
00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.767
Pantheon Publicity.
please hold.

485
00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:00.233
Pantheon Publicity.
please hold.

486
00:25:01.867 --> 00:25:03.266
Pantheon Publicity.
please hold.

487
00:25:04.567 --> 00:25:06.600
Pantheon Publicity.
please hold.

488
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.767
Pantheon Publicity.
please hold.

489
00:25:13.734 --> 00:25:15.667
Try again. Austin.
My desk. two hours.

490
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:24.300
Wow! This is pretty great.

491
00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.567
Are none of my spots sacred?

492
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:29.467
Why so grumpy?

493
00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.567
Let me guess. your master plan
isn't working out how you hoped?

494
00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.200
Not exactly.
How about yours?

495
00:26:34.333 --> 00:26:36.066
Hm.

496
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.667
May have told the temp agency to
throw everything they got at me.

497
00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.467
And?

498
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.333
And. a hedge fund offered me
a full-time admin job today.

499
00:26:43.467 --> 00:26:46.367
Let me guess.
you turned it down?

500
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.734
How did you know that?

501
00:26:47.867 --> 00:26:50.033
You did the same thing
at the museum.

502
00:26:50.166 --> 00:26:51.834
Will told me.

503
00:26:51.967 --> 00:26:54.700
One cappuccino in that guy and
suddenly he's Lady Whistledown.

504
00:26:54.834 --> 00:26:56.967
Doesn't it seem odd that you
keep turning down jobs

505
00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:58.533
without even giving them
a chance?

506
00:26:58.667 --> 00:27:02.433
No. Because I'm not looking
for just a job.

507
00:27:02.567 --> 00:27:04.767
I am looking for a
fulfilling career.

508
00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.633
And when I find it. it's going
to feel like a lightning bolt.

509
00:27:07.767 --> 00:27:09.533
What's with the deadline
anyway?

510
00:27:09.667 --> 00:27:11.100
Why don't you give yourself
more time?

511
00:27:11.233 --> 00:27:13.867
Well. I gave myself
until my 30th birthday.

512
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.533
Uh-ha. it all makes sense now.
You're scared.

513
00:27:18.667 --> 00:27:19.800
I am not sacred.

514
00:27:19.934 --> 00:27:21.600
Your 20's are in the rearview.

515
00:27:21.734 --> 00:27:24.033
The choice you make now
will have consequences.

516
00:27:24.166 --> 00:27:26.800
Make the wrong one and you
could end up stuck for life.

517
00:27:26.934 --> 00:27:28.700
Exactly. That's the point.

518
00:27:28.834 --> 00:27:31.266
Which is why I gave myself
the freedom to try out

519
00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.800
multiple careers so I can make
the right decision.

520
00:27:34.934 --> 00:27:37.700
And. in fact. I think you're
the one who's scared.

521
00:27:37.834 --> 00:27:39.567
Obsessing over every
little punctuation

522
00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:40.767
in an otherwise finished book.

523
00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:41.767
How do you know that?

524
00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:42.767
Toby.

525
00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:44.800
Those two. I swear.

526
00:27:46.900 --> 00:27:50.467
So. why not just send it out?

527
00:27:52.266 --> 00:27:54.400
Unless you're scared
of succeeding?

528
00:27:54.533 --> 00:27:57.233
No. Now who's making
baseless accusations?

529
00:27:57.367 --> 00:27:58.734
Oh. ok.

530
00:27:58.867 --> 00:28:01.467
If they're so baseless
then why not just send it?

531
00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:03.300
All due respect.
you're the last person

532
00:28:03.433 --> 00:28:05.133
I'll be taking
career advice from.

533
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:07.834
Well. then why don't you
take it from your mom?

534
00:28:07.967 --> 00:28:10.667
I bet she didn't get
where she is by holding back.

535
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.800
You have no idea the choices
my mom made to get where she is.

536
00:28:13.934 --> 00:28:15.867
Well. I know she. at least.
made some choices.

537
00:28:18.734 --> 00:28:20.033
Good night. Austin.

538
00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.100
Good night.

539
00:28:59.033 --> 00:29:01.700
One pumpkin spice latte.
extra cinnamon.

540
00:29:01.834 --> 00:29:02.734
Piper!

541
00:29:02.867 --> 00:29:03.900
Hm? Oh!

542
00:29:04.033 --> 00:29:05.000
Thanks.

543
00:29:08.767 --> 00:29:12.000
Question. don't you think
that turning 30 is a benchmark?

544
00:29:12.133 --> 00:29:14.066
One of those mornings. is it?

545
00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:19.567
Well. as a wizened oracle of 44.
I'd say age is just a number.

546
00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.100
But three zero is a number
worth celebrating.

547
00:29:24.233 --> 00:29:25.400
When's the big day?

548
00:29:25.533 --> 00:29:26.900
Uh. in five weeks.

549
00:29:27.033 --> 00:29:28.066
Oooh. I'm already planning
your party.

550
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.300
You don't have to.

551
00:29:29.433 --> 00:29:31.000
No. it's too late.
It's already in my head.

552
00:29:31.133 --> 00:29:32.834
And once the train leaves the
station there's no stopping it.

553
00:29:32.967 --> 00:29:34.467
How do you feel about
funny hats?

554
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.000
Uh...

555
00:29:36.133 --> 00:29:38.333
I've learned to just go along
for the ride.

556
00:29:38.467 --> 00:29:40.300
Love them.

557
00:29:40.433 --> 00:29:43.834
Getting the big 3-0 jitters?

558
00:29:43.967 --> 00:29:46.400
It's just something Austin said
on the rooftop the other night.

559
00:29:46.533 --> 00:29:48.633
The roof? What roof?

560
00:29:48.767 --> 00:29:50.967
Is there a great view and
a place to string lights?

561
00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:52.133
I think so.

562
00:29:52.266 --> 00:29:54.266
That's where we'll do
your party.

563
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.967
Carry on.

564
00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:57.934
He basically said that my fear
of making the wrong choice

565
00:29:58.066 --> 00:30:00.166
is holding me back
from finding my path.

566
00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:02.133
You think there's any truth
to that?

567
00:30:02.266 --> 00:30:03.900
Maybe.

568
00:30:04.033 --> 00:30:05.333
I wasn't always a baker.
you know.

569
00:30:05.467 --> 00:30:06.633
It's true.

570
00:30:06.767 --> 00:30:07.967
I fell in love with
a corporate attorney

571
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.000
who risked it all for what
he really wanted.

572
00:30:10.133 --> 00:30:11.233
- Me.
- Pumpkin bread.

573
00:30:15.233 --> 00:30:17.000
Finding your dream.

574
00:30:17.133 --> 00:30:21.900
the thing that makes you want
to jump out of bed each day.

575
00:30:22.033 --> 00:30:23.433
you'll know it
when you find it.

576
00:30:24.467 --> 00:30:25.500
What if I don't?

577
00:30:26.633 --> 00:30:28.000
Don't lose hope just yet.

578
00:30:29.967 --> 00:30:31.967
Thanks for the pep talk.

579
00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.633
So what wild temp job
are you headed off to now?

580
00:30:34.767 --> 00:30:37.967
Actually. it's an interview
to be a dinner hostess.

581
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.734
I figured I could bank
some extra cash

582
00:30:39.867 --> 00:30:41.400
in between the temp jobs.

583
00:30:41.533 --> 00:30:43.233
It's not like I can make
a career out of drawing

584
00:30:43.367 --> 00:30:44.934
in my apartment at night.

585
00:30:45.066 --> 00:30:47.400
- Good luck.
- Thanks. See ya later!

586
00:30:55.734 --> 00:30:57.834
This must be a very
popular restaurant.

587
00:30:59.233 --> 00:31:00.233
Doesn't look like a restaurant

588
00:31:00.367 --> 00:31:02.333
but maybe they're having
some interviews.

589
00:31:02.467 --> 00:31:03.467
Hi.

590
00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:20.867
Hey. Alan.

591
00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:22.800
I forgot to mention I've got
a dentist appointment today.

592
00:31:22.934 --> 00:31:24.500
Gotta lay off the candy
in the break room.

593
00:31:24.633 --> 00:31:27.867
so I'm gonna be a day late
with my article.

594
00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.467
I hope you understand.

595
00:31:36.633 --> 00:31:38.967
- Piper Grant?
- Oh. yep!

596
00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.300
We're ready for you.

597
00:31:40.433 --> 00:31:42.400
Ok. Thanks.

598
00:31:50.533 --> 00:31:52.800
You can leave your headshot
and resumé on the table. please.

599
00:31:52.934 --> 00:31:55.967
Oh. I just have a resumé.
I don't have a headshot.

600
00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.300
Of course not.
Did you prepare the sides?

601
00:31:58.433 --> 00:32:02.266
Uh. sides?
Like. curly fries?

602
00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:04.967
Isn't... isn't that
the chef's job?

603
00:32:06.233 --> 00:32:11.233
Oh. is this one of those
performance restaurants

604
00:32:11.367 --> 00:32:14.367
like Medieval Times
or Ed Debevic's? Like...

605
00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.967
No. honey.

606
00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:19.033
We're casting for
a Broadway musical.

607
00:32:19.166 --> 00:32:23.300
Oh. Broadway.
Like. Broadway. Broadway.

608
00:32:23.433 --> 00:32:24.967
Can you sing us something?

609
00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:28.233
Oh. um. I. I don't...

610
00:32:32.166 --> 00:32:36.400
You know. there is one song
I know...

611
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:45.767
♪ Give my
regards to Broadway ♪

612
00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:50.567
♪ Remember me
from Herald Square ♪

613
00:32:56.734 --> 00:32:59.133
Just setting you all up
for success.

614
00:33:03.834 --> 00:33:05.200
You're welcome.

615
00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.300
It's well-written
and very interesting.

616
00:33:17.433 --> 00:33:20.800
A squirrel finds an oak tree
who's acorns grant wishes.

617
00:33:20.934 --> 00:33:23.133
Charming concept.

618
00:33:23.266 --> 00:33:26.166
There's so much potential here.
I wanted more.

619
00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.967
That's so great to hear. Susan.

620
00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.500
No. I mean I wanted more story.

621
00:33:30.633 --> 00:33:32.333
I don't follow.

622
00:33:32.467 --> 00:33:35.867
One-off books are hard to sell.
It's all about series nowadays.

623
00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.500
I guess I never
considered that.

624
00:33:37.633 --> 00:33:39.200
I'd like you to come back
in a couple of weeks.

625
00:33:39.333 --> 00:33:42.100
Pitch your vision
for a larger series.

626
00:33:42.233 --> 00:33:44.100
Then I can assess whether it
might be a good fit for us.

627
00:33:44.233 --> 00:33:45.200
A couple weeks?

628
00:33:46.834 --> 00:33:49.633
Yeah. yeah I can...
I can do that.

629
00:33:52.166 --> 00:33:54.767
Ok. I'll. uh. we'll talk.

630
00:33:54.900 --> 00:33:55.967
My assistant said
the restaurant

631
00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.500
couldn't fit a table for 20.

632
00:33:57.633 --> 00:34:00.200
It's my opening night.
for goodness sake.

633
00:34:00.333 --> 00:34:02.734
You know the place that has
the wallpaper with the birds

634
00:34:02.867 --> 00:34:05.000
and the dessert
with the rose petals.

635
00:34:05.133 --> 00:34:06.100
What's it called...

636
00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:08.934
Constellation.

637
00:34:09.066 --> 00:34:12.333
And that rose petal pie
is incredible.

638
00:34:12.467 --> 00:34:13.600
I'll call you back.

639
00:34:15.033 --> 00:34:17.166
I could probably get you
a table if you wanted.

640
00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.500
I lugged apples around
for them last week

641
00:34:19.633 --> 00:34:21.266
and I made friends
with the chef.

642
00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.934
If only my last two assistants
were as resourceful.

643
00:34:24.066 --> 00:34:26.700
Are. are you looking
for an assistant?

644
00:34:26.834 --> 00:34:29.000
That depends.
Are you an actress?

645
00:34:29.133 --> 00:34:32.700
Uh. recent experience
proves no.

646
00:34:32.834 --> 00:34:34.500
Definitely. definitely. not.

647
00:34:34.633 --> 00:34:36.100
Do you have any references?

648
00:34:36.233 --> 00:34:38.400
Oh. never mind. my previous
two girls had great references

649
00:34:38.533 --> 00:34:40.333
and look where that got us.

650
00:34:40.467 --> 00:34:43.700
This is a full-time job.
Are you up to the task?

651
00:34:43.834 --> 00:34:46.767
A full-time job is exactly
what I'm looking for.

652
00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:49.200
You're hired.
For a trial period.

653
00:34:49.333 --> 00:34:50.367
You start tomorrow.

654
00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:51.533
Great.

655
00:34:52.967 --> 00:34:55.900
So. does it come with
health benefits or...

656
00:34:56.033 --> 00:34:57.266
Don't be late.

657
00:35:00.567 --> 00:35:01.667
Great!

658
00:35:08.467 --> 00:35:09.467
Water.

659
00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:17.300
Oh. Don't want you to smudge
your lipstick.

660
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:20.667
Thank you.

661
00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.133
"Miss Chilton's performance
shone like a sparkling diamond

662
00:35:33.266 --> 00:35:35.533
"in a career full of gems."

663
00:35:35.667 --> 00:35:37.333
From the top.

664
00:35:37.467 --> 00:35:42.300
Uh. "Miss Chilton's performance
shone like a sparkling diamond

665
00:35:42.433 --> 00:35:44.533
"in a career full of gems."

666
00:35:44.667 --> 00:35:45.800
Again.

667
00:35:45.934 --> 00:35:47.700
But I just read it twice.

668
00:35:47.834 --> 00:35:49.900
Oh. you think I'm being silly.
don't you?

669
00:35:50.033 --> 00:35:51.867
Well. maybe you're right.

670
00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.834
but I worked hard to get
to where I am

671
00:35:53.967 --> 00:35:55.567
and so when someone acknowledges
my skill.

672
00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.567
I listen.
And I listen well.

673
00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.633
These moments. they don't come
along every day.

674
00:36:01.767 --> 00:36:04.233
Once again. from the top.

675
00:36:04.367 --> 00:36:08.433
"Miss Chilton's performance.
it shone like a sparkling
diamond..."

676
00:36:10.867 --> 00:36:12.767
When can you get me and Tobes
tickets to her new show?

677
00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.533
Ugh.

678
00:36:14.667 --> 00:36:16.033
Come on. it's the whole point
of having famous friends.

679
00:36:16.166 --> 00:36:17.867
Yeah. well I'm not
the famous one.

680
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.433
But. it is pretty exciting.

681
00:36:19.567 --> 00:36:21.066
That's because you're famous
by association.

682
00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.200
Ryan Gosling once ordered
a cold brew at the café

683
00:36:23.333 --> 00:36:26.033
and I'm basically
a D-list celeb now.

684
00:36:26.166 --> 00:36:28.600
Maybe something in theatre
is what I'm meant to do.

685
00:36:28.734 --> 00:36:30.867
Now I really wish we had
a liquor license

686
00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.900
so I could pour you
a celebratory drink.

687
00:36:33.033 --> 00:36:34.400
Not so fast.

688
00:36:34.533 --> 00:36:36.767
I haven't even pitched
for this series yet.

689
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:38.066
Details.

690
00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:39.700
Have you told Piper
the good news?

691
00:36:39.834 --> 00:36:42.300
No. Last we spoke
we got into an-

692
00:36:42.433 --> 00:36:43.600
Argument.

693
00:36:43.734 --> 00:36:44.934
And we haven't spoken since.

694
00:36:45.066 --> 00:36:46.400
Well you should tell him
about your new job.

695
00:36:46.533 --> 00:36:48.600
If anything. he'll be happy
you took his advice.

696
00:36:48.734 --> 00:36:51.400
And give him the satisfaction?
I would rather-

697
00:36:51.533 --> 00:36:52.900
Not.

698
00:36:53.033 --> 00:36:54.266
I'd never hear the end of it.

699
00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.734
You know how she can be.

700
00:36:55.867 --> 00:36:58.567
Always so confident she has
all the right moves.

701
00:36:58.700 --> 00:36:59.567
Uh-huh.

702
00:37:01.333 --> 00:37:02.867
Hey. do you want to picnic
tomorrow in Central Park?

703
00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.934
- I'd love to.
- Great.

704
00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.300
Austin? What are you doing here?

705
00:37:16.433 --> 00:37:17.266
What are you doing here?

706
00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:18.667
I'm meeting Will for lunch.

707
00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:20.500
I'm having lunch with Toby.

708
00:37:20.633 --> 00:37:21.867
They weren't planning
for the four of us...

709
00:37:24.567 --> 00:37:26.033
"Hey guys. sorry.
can't make it.

710
00:37:26.166 --> 00:37:27.834
"Busy at the café.

711
00:37:27.967 --> 00:37:30.367
"Have fun without us."

712
00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:33.300
He could have at least tried
to make that sound convincing.

713
00:37:34.433 --> 00:37:35.700
Austin and Piper?

714
00:37:35.834 --> 00:37:37.800
Toby sends you both
the harvest lunch.

715
00:37:37.934 --> 00:37:39.934
Um. thank you?

716
00:37:41.633 --> 00:37:42.767
Thanks.

717
00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.533
We don't have to do this.

718
00:37:46.667 --> 00:37:48.300
Nope. we do not.

719
00:37:50.734 --> 00:37:52.300
There is a lot of cheese.

720
00:37:52.433 --> 00:37:56.934
- What about charcuterie?
- Yep. Oh! Fig jam.

721
00:37:57.066 --> 00:38:00.533
It would be a chance
at a new experience.

722
00:38:00.667 --> 00:38:02.233
It is always nice here
in autumn.

723
00:38:02.367 --> 00:38:05.433
I'm sorry. did you
just compliment the city?

724
00:38:06.967 --> 00:38:09.433
What has gotten into you?

725
00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.233
You never mentioned
you draw.

726
00:38:13.367 --> 00:38:15.567
You never asked.

727
00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:16.767
Can I see?

728
00:38:22.567 --> 00:38:24.667
These are seriously great.

729
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:28.400
You ever consider pursuing art
as your dream?

730
00:38:28.533 --> 00:38:29.734
No. absolutely not.

731
00:38:29.867 --> 00:38:31.233
It's just something I do
for fun.

732
00:38:31.367 --> 00:38:33.767
You ever wanted to make
something more of it?

733
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:37.000
My parents scrimped and saved
to send me to college

734
00:38:37.133 --> 00:38:38.900
and in return.
the expectation was

735
00:38:39.033 --> 00:38:40.533
that I would take over
the family business

736
00:38:40.667 --> 00:38:44.500
or at least secure a practical
job in a practical career.

737
00:38:44.633 --> 00:38:46.433
But art is a career.

738
00:38:46.567 --> 00:38:48.700
Growing up. if a career
wasn't stable

739
00:38:48.834 --> 00:38:51.166
then it wasn't a
legitimate career.

740
00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:53.567
Choosing something creative
was throwing your life away.

741
00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.934
You know. there's good sense
in that.

742
00:38:56.066 --> 00:38:59.767
Art is fun but it's really
difficult to make a living

743
00:38:59.900 --> 00:39:01.767
drawing sketches.

744
00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:04.000
Well. you're very talented.

745
00:39:05.867 --> 00:39:07.867
I call dibs on all
the stinky cheese.

746
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.633
Listen. I feel like I owe you
an apology.

747
00:39:14.767 --> 00:39:16.967
I'm sorry for the way
I acted last week.

748
00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:20.967
No. I... You were right.
I was jumping from job to job.

749
00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.300
No. you were just testing
out the waters.

750
00:39:23.433 --> 00:39:27.133
I just hadn't found anything
that felt right.

751
00:39:27.266 --> 00:39:28.900
And I didn't want to waste
any more time.

752
00:39:29.033 --> 00:39:31.400
I mean. everyone my age already
had their life figured out

753
00:39:31.533 --> 00:39:34.900
and I'm just at
the starting line.

754
00:39:35.033 --> 00:39:37.500
What's that advice about
everyone running their own race

755
00:39:37.633 --> 00:39:39.400
at their own pace?

756
00:39:39.533 --> 00:39:40.633
Not the advice you want
to hear

757
00:39:40.767 --> 00:39:43.233
when you're on a
four-week deadline.

758
00:39:43.367 --> 00:39:46.834
But. I did actually accept a
full-time job as an assistant

759
00:39:46.967 --> 00:39:49.500
to a famous Broadway actress.

760
00:39:49.633 --> 00:39:53.600
Wow. That's great.
Piper. I'm so happy for you.

761
00:39:53.734 --> 00:39:54.667
Thanks.

762
00:39:55.734 --> 00:39:57.934
And I owe you an apology too.

763
00:39:58.066 --> 00:39:59.834
I shouldn't have butted in
on your writing.

764
00:39:59.967 --> 00:40:01.734
No. I'm glad you did.

765
00:40:01.867 --> 00:40:04.600
I took your advice and
reached out to a publisher.

766
00:40:04.734 --> 00:40:06.834
She wants to hear my pitch
for the book as a series

767
00:40:06.967 --> 00:40:07.834
in a couple weeks.

768
00:40:07.967 --> 00:40:09.734
That's incredible.

769
00:40:09.867 --> 00:40:11.266
I owe it all to you.

770
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:13.967
So what is this book about?

771
00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.800
Well. it's about a squirrel
named Nathan

772
00:40:16.934 --> 00:40:19.667
who finds an oak tree
with magical acorns

773
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.600
that grant wishes.

774
00:40:21.734 --> 00:40:23.967
His first wish is to become
a movie star.

775
00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:27.300
Then. to bat a home run
at the world series

776
00:40:27.433 --> 00:40:30.900
and then to become the first
squirrel to walk on the moon.

777
00:40:31.033 --> 00:40:33.266
He doesn't have friends
so his wishes wind up

778
00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.600
being a way he keeps
himself company.

779
00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:38.600
Am I boring you?

780
00:40:38.734 --> 00:40:39.667
No. no. no.

781
00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:41.066
No. I'm listening.
Keep going.

782
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.734
So. for the series. I was
thinking that maybe

783
00:40:43.867 --> 00:40:45.800
another animal finds
the oak tree too.

784
00:40:45.934 --> 00:40:47.633
A blue jay.

785
00:40:47.767 --> 00:40:50.100
The squirrel and the blue jay
are initially rivals

786
00:40:50.233 --> 00:40:52.266
but then they eventually become
best friends

787
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.233
and go on adventures together.

788
00:40:57.066 --> 00:41:00.066
But I can see it's not
as engaging as I had hoped.

789
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.000
Maybe it needs a new direction.

790
00:41:02.133 --> 00:41:04.734
No. I think... I think
the direction is perfect.

791
00:41:04.867 --> 00:41:06.166
Kind of like this?

792
00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Wow.

793
00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:15.400
This is even better
than I imagined.

794
00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.333
I always pictured it
in the summer

795
00:41:20.467 --> 00:41:24.400
but it's better in the fall.
It's beautiful.

796
00:41:25.667 --> 00:41:26.500
What?

797
00:41:26.633 --> 00:41:27.867
Nothing. I just-

798
00:41:30.867 --> 00:41:33.533
It's my mother.
I'll call her back.

799
00:41:33.667 --> 00:41:35.400
No. answer it.
It's your mom.

800
00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.967
Hi. Mom.

801
00:41:39.100 --> 00:41:40.800
Austin. swing by for dinner
on Friday.

802
00:41:40.934 --> 00:41:44.033
I want to hear how your job
is going.

803
00:41:44.166 --> 00:41:46.567
Alright. see ya then.

804
00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.533
Dinner with your mom.
That sounds fun.

805
00:41:48.667 --> 00:41:50.200
The evening's menu
will include catering

806
00:41:50.333 --> 00:41:52.000
from my mother's favorite restaurant

807
00:41:52.133 --> 00:41:54.166
and parental disappointment.

808
00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.633
I'm sure it's not gonna be
that bad.

809
00:41:57.767 --> 00:41:59.533
Why don't you come and see
for yourself?

810
00:41:59.667 --> 00:42:01.200
No. no.

811
00:42:01.333 --> 00:42:02.433
Come on. You're the one
who's always talking about

812
00:42:02.567 --> 00:42:03.967
trying new experiences.

813
00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:06.567
Yeah. like a picnic
in Central Park.

814
00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:10.433
Not dinner at a famous broadcast
journalist's home.

815
00:42:10.567 --> 00:42:12.433
It'll be a chance to see
New York success

816
00:42:12.567 --> 00:42:14.233
up close and personal.

817
00:42:14.367 --> 00:42:16.967
Dine with the hoi polloi
in Brooklyn Heights.

818
00:42:17.100 --> 00:42:19.767
Come on. at the very least
it'll be a free meal

819
00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.100
and a chance to see

820
00:42:21.233 --> 00:42:23.100
what a famous person's
bathroom looks like.

821
00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:27.800
Well. when you put it that way.

822
00:42:38.934 --> 00:42:40.800
Austin.

823
00:42:40.934 --> 00:42:43.166
This is the third time in as
many weeks that you're late.

824
00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.767
I'm not really much
of a morning person.

825
00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.300
I'm not talking about
when you get here.

826
00:42:46.433 --> 00:42:47.967
although you are usually late.

827
00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.333
Your last few assignments have
been turned in past deadline

828
00:42:49.467 --> 00:42:50.867
which puts a squeeze
on copy edit.

829
00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.467
I shouldn't even have
to explain this to you.

830
00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.200
Ok. Faster turnarounds.
you got it.

831
00:42:54.333 --> 00:42:55.467
Even when it's on time.

832
00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.467
your work is below
what you're capable of.

833
00:42:57.600 --> 00:42:59.166
It's clear your heart's
not in this.

834
00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:00.767
I have to let you go.

835
00:43:10.533 --> 00:43:13.333
Ha. ha. ha. ha.
La. la. la. la...

836
00:43:16.867 --> 00:43:21.834
La... La. la. la. la. la. la...

837
00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:25.066
Just answer it!

838
00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:26.200
Sorry.

839
00:43:27.667 --> 00:43:28.700
Hello?

840
00:43:28.834 --> 00:43:30.433
Hi. Piper.
It's Barbara.

841
00:43:30.567 --> 00:43:33.100
We have a new job listing.
it starts tomorrow.

842
00:43:33.233 --> 00:43:37.900
Hi. Barbara. I actually took
a full-time position.

843
00:43:38.033 --> 00:43:40.934
Oh. Well. that's great.

844
00:43:41.066 --> 00:43:42.834
I know how important it was
for you to find a job

845
00:43:42.967 --> 00:43:44.266
that was a good fit.

846
00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:45.900
La. la. la. la...

847
00:43:46.033 --> 00:43:49.367
Well it looks like you
finally found your calling.

848
00:43:49.500 --> 00:43:51.700
Yes. Yes. I have.

849
00:43:51.834 --> 00:43:53.500
I really appreciate
all your hard work.

850
00:43:53.633 --> 00:43:54.767
Thank you so much.

851
00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.066
La. la. la. la...

852
00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:02.066
Sorry about that.

853
00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.900
It's fine.

854
00:44:04.033 --> 00:44:05.467
You'll need to get your affairs
in order anyway

855
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:06.767
before we go on tour.

856
00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:08.834
Uh. on tour?

857
00:44:08.967 --> 00:44:12.834
Yes. My agent called yesterday
with an offer I couldn't refuse.

858
00:44:12.967 --> 00:44:15.266
Playing Maria in
the Sound of Music.

859
00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:17.767
Like a tour outside
of New York?

860
00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:20.567
That is generally what happens
when you go on tour.

861
00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:23.467
And how long would that be?

862
00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:24.834
Three months.

863
00:44:24.967 --> 00:44:26.467
But then. it's off to
the West End in London

864
00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:28.433
for the run of the new
Andrew Lloyd Webber.

865
00:44:28.567 --> 00:44:31.967
That is a fantastic opportunity.

866
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:35.834
You know. see the country.
travel abroad...

867
00:44:35.967 --> 00:44:37.934
Why do I get the feeling you're
trying to convince yourself?

868
00:44:38.066 --> 00:44:40.333
No. no that is...
that is not it.

869
00:44:40.467 --> 00:44:42.300
I thought the world of theatre
was what you wanted?

870
00:44:42.433 --> 00:44:46.333
I guess I just hadn't really
considered all of the details.

871
00:44:46.467 --> 00:44:49.400
Well. I couldn't forgive myself
if I stood in the way of you

872
00:44:49.533 --> 00:44:52.066
becoming the person
that you were meant to be.

873
00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:54.066
What does that mean?

874
00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.400
I need someone by my side
who's lifeblood is the theatre.

875
00:44:57.533 --> 00:45:00.834
It's just not you.
I'm sorry. Piper.

876
00:45:00.967 --> 00:45:02.233
I'm going to have
to let you go.

877
00:45:02.367 --> 00:45:03.200
But... but. what?

878
00:45:03.333 --> 00:45:04.967
Oh. don't look so sad.

879
00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:07.900
Think of this as your
fantastic opportunity.

880
00:45:08.033 --> 00:45:10.967
A chance for you to discover
your true calling.

881
00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:16.133
Yes. yes. it is. Yes.

882
00:45:16.266 --> 00:45:18.300
La. la. la. la. la. la...

883
00:45:20.867 --> 00:45:23.033
It seems like we both
got kicked to the curb today.

884
00:45:23.166 --> 00:45:25.200
Not our finest hour.

885
00:45:25.333 --> 00:45:27.333
I haven't got a foothold
in anywhere.

886
00:45:27.467 --> 00:45:29.567
I have less than a month left
in my sublet

887
00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:31.734
and I feel like I'm back
at square one.

888
00:45:31.867 --> 00:45:34.033
Why didn't you want to go
on tour with Misty?

889
00:45:34.166 --> 00:45:36.200
I guess it was a great opportunity

890
00:45:36.333 --> 00:45:37.700
but all of my instincts
were telling me

891
00:45:37.834 --> 00:45:39.000
it was the wrong choice.

892
00:45:41.333 --> 00:45:42.834
Hm. my dad.

893
00:45:44.133 --> 00:45:45.667
Don't want to answer?

894
00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:48.000
And let him know
that I was fired?

895
00:45:48.133 --> 00:45:50.066
I'd would never hear
the end of it.

896
00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.467
Sometimes I feel like my
parents care a little too much.

897
00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:56.200
I wouldn't have minded
that kind of attention
growing up here.

898
00:45:56.333 --> 00:45:59.700
What was that like?
You never mentioned your dad.

899
00:45:59.834 --> 00:46:01.533
My dad and I haven't had much of
a relationship

900
00:46:01.667 --> 00:46:03.400
since the divorce.

901
00:46:03.533 --> 00:46:06.734
Another consequence
of the successful life.

902
00:46:06.867 --> 00:46:08.734
So. what happened?

903
00:46:08.867 --> 00:46:10.200
My dad was a segment producer

904
00:46:10.333 --> 00:46:12.400
and my mom was just
a junior anchor.

905
00:46:12.533 --> 00:46:14.233
Network wanted to give her.
her own hour

906
00:46:14.367 --> 00:46:16.400
but they didn't want
my dad involved.

907
00:46:16.533 --> 00:46:19.767
She took the job and that became
a running theme in my life.

908
00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:22.066
Her choosing work
over everything else.

909
00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.734
I'm sorry you went
through that.

910
00:46:24.867 --> 00:46:28.600
So. we won't be telling
my mom I got fired either.

911
00:46:28.734 --> 00:46:29.967
Deal.

912
00:46:32.734 --> 00:46:35.533
When I covered the '92 Olympics.
Christie said to me

913
00:46:35.667 --> 00:46:39.433
"I have faced an audience
of millions of people

914
00:46:39.567 --> 00:46:42.233
"waiting for me to fall.
but nothing compared

915
00:46:42.367 --> 00:46:44.233
"to facing an interview
with you."

916
00:46:45.867 --> 00:46:47.700
Imagine that?

917
00:46:47.834 --> 00:46:51.367
A gold medalist and she was
nervous to sit down with me.

918
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:55.600
You have had such
amazing experiences.

919
00:46:55.734 --> 00:46:58.934
I have and preparing for this
retrospective has been quite

920
00:46:59.066 --> 00:47:02.100
the jaunt down memory lane.

921
00:47:02.233 --> 00:47:05.667
But I feel like I've been doing
the talking all evening.

922
00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.200
Maybe because you have.

923
00:47:07.333 --> 00:47:09.533
Oh. honey.

924
00:47:09.667 --> 00:47:13.500
You know I read your piece on
the piano teacher in Brooklyn.

925
00:47:13.633 --> 00:47:15.333
It was good.

926
00:47:15.467 --> 00:47:20.300
I thought it could maybe use
a little more. um. pizazz maybe?

927
00:47:21.433 --> 00:47:23.000
Well. I

928
00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.266
Is that the paper?

929
00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.200
I better take this.
Excuse me.

930
00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:39.834
It's a relief seeing him
marching forward with his life.

931
00:47:39.967 --> 00:47:43.467
Now if only I could figure out
what to do with my life.

932
00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:48.300
I feel like I'm just bobbing
along kind of directionless.

933
00:47:48.433 --> 00:47:50.700
You know. I have something
for you to see.

934
00:47:51.834 --> 00:47:53.200
Come with me.

935
00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:00.500
This is what I wanted
to show you.

936
00:48:00.633 --> 00:48:04.367
This is the pen that I used
to write my first article.

937
00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:07.600
The one that kicked off
my career.

938
00:48:07.734 --> 00:48:11.867
Now. this is back in the day of
carbon paper and fax machines.

939
00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.700
What's a fax machine?

940
00:48:15.367 --> 00:48:16.266
It was a joke.

941
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.767
You have a sparkle. Piper.

942
00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:22.867
And you know this city will try
its best to dull that.

943
00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.734
so. don't let it.

944
00:48:25.867 --> 00:48:28.934
You know. my family wasn't
very thrilled

945
00:48:29.066 --> 00:48:32.000
that I left our little town
in Ohio.

946
00:48:32.133 --> 00:48:35.567
And they figured that I would
fail and come running home

947
00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:37.600
with my tail between my legs.

948
00:48:37.734 --> 00:48:42.033
But once they saw my first
article in print.

949
00:48:42.166 --> 00:48:45.500
they saw something tangible
and they started to understand.

950
00:48:45.633 --> 00:48:48.367
My family is the exact
same way.

951
00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.533
They think that I don't know
what I'm doing.

952
00:48:51.667 --> 00:48:53.700
I don't know.
Maybe. maybe they're right.

953
00:48:53.834 --> 00:48:56.066
Maybe I'm crazy for chasing
after a dream

954
00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:00.600
that I don't even know
what it is yet.

955
00:49:00.734 --> 00:49:03.433
How did you figure out that
journalism was your passion?

956
00:49:03.567 --> 00:49:06.066
I took it as an elective
in college.

957
00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:10.500
And from my very first lecture.
I was hooked.

958
00:49:10.633 --> 00:49:12.567
I'm starting to think I'm never
gonna have that feeling.

959
00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.333
Trust in yourself. Piper.

960
00:49:15.467 --> 00:49:19.233
Nothing is more important
for a woman in this world.

961
00:49:19.367 --> 00:49:22.800
Especially for a woman looking
to find her way.

962
00:49:22.934 --> 00:49:24.934
It can be hard to resist
the pressures

963
00:49:25.066 --> 00:49:27.600
of what other people
want for us.

964
00:49:27.734 --> 00:49:30.166
But we must double down
on ourselves

965
00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:34.734
and never expect others
to hand us what we want.

966
00:49:34.867 --> 00:49:36.500
So. remember one thing.

967
00:49:36.633 --> 00:49:41.333
Always. always be your
own champion.

968
00:49:47.533 --> 00:49:51.967
Thank you for dinner. Mom.
Top-notch selection as always.

969
00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:55.300
They're going to be holding the
retrospective at the restaurant.

970
00:49:55.433 --> 00:49:57.934
Piper. you must come.

971
00:49:58.066 --> 00:50:00.333
That would be great
and thank you again

972
00:50:00.467 --> 00:50:02.800
for the wonderful dinner.

973
00:50:02.934 --> 00:50:05.433
I really love this painting.
by the way.

974
00:50:05.567 --> 00:50:09.633
The texture and composition
really balance the vivid hues.

975
00:50:09.767 --> 00:50:12.266
Most people just say
"pretty colors."

976
00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:15.967
Well. I'm friends with
the gallery owner.

977
00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:18.300
Piper's a wonderful
artist herself.

978
00:50:18.433 --> 00:50:21.333
I... I just doodle sometimes.
that's all.

979
00:50:21.467 --> 00:50:23.266
Maybe you should introduce her
to your friend.

980
00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.567
He might know of
an open position.

981
00:50:24.700 --> 00:50:25.967
I don't... I don't want
to impose.

982
00:50:26.100 --> 00:50:27.400
Well. I'd be happy to.

983
00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:31.600
I would really appreciate that.
Thank you.

984
00:50:31.734 --> 00:50:34.333
My pleasure.
It was lovely meeting you.

985
00:50:34.467 --> 00:50:36.734
So lovely meeting you.

986
00:50:36.867 --> 00:50:38.066
Thank you for dinner. Mom.

987
00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:40.667
- Alright. hon. Good night.
- Good night.

988
00:50:45.734 --> 00:50:47.834
That wasn't The Chronicle
calling. was it?

989
00:50:47.967 --> 00:50:49.066
Publisher. I told her my idea

990
00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.967
for the rough shape
of the series.

991
00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:52.300
I pitch it in 10 days.

992
00:50:52.433 --> 00:50:55.000
- Wow. that's soon. isn't it?
- Yeah. it is.

993
00:50:55.133 --> 00:50:58.300
I better get home and put
my nose to the grindstone.

994
00:50:58.433 --> 00:50:59.767
Since we're already
in Brooklyn.

995
00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:02.667
I figured we could take
a little detour first.

996
00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.834
If you're going to be
a real New Yorker.

997
00:51:04.967 --> 00:51:06.633
there's something you need
to see.

998
00:51:12.734 --> 00:51:15.900
ful music]

999
00:51:16.033 --> 00:51:17.700
This is incredible!

1000
00:51:18.734 --> 00:51:20.734
For once. I actually
agree with you.

1001
00:51:21.867 --> 00:51:24.266
This is why I came
to New York City.

1002
00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.266
It's just so alive
with possibility.

1003
00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.734
Traffic jams
and tiny apartments.

1004
00:51:30.867 --> 00:51:31.800
Stop.

1005
00:51:33.667 --> 00:51:35.633
Just take it all in.

1006
00:51:36.934 --> 00:51:40.467
There is nothing else like
this view in the whole world.

1007
00:51:42.934 --> 00:51:46.433
It's unique.
I give you that.

1008
00:51:46.567 --> 00:51:48.100
It's like a dream.

1009
00:51:48.233 --> 00:51:53.066
Life and movement and energy.
It makes me want to draw.

1010
00:51:56.533 --> 00:51:58.066
Makes me want to eat.

1011
00:52:00.467 --> 00:52:01.867
Are you hungry?

1012
00:52:03.834 --> 00:52:06.433
- I can go for a bite.
- I'm starving.

1013
00:52:06.567 --> 00:52:09.533
Of course you are.
Do you have some place in mind?

1014
00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:11.867
Come with me.

1015
00:52:18.266 --> 00:52:19.433
Thank you.

1016
00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:28.834
Now this is a real taste
of New York.

1017
00:52:31.066 --> 00:52:34.166
That veggie dog does look
pretty good.

1018
00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.166
And I am kind of hungry.

1019
00:52:36.300 --> 00:52:37.967
Who wouldn't be after a dinner
of two lettuce leaves

1020
00:52:38.100 --> 00:52:40.467
a celery dish that
wouldn't feed a rabbit.

1021
00:52:42.133 --> 00:52:45.834
It was um... refreshing.

1022
00:52:45.967 --> 00:52:47.633
Here you go. try that.

1023
00:52:47.767 --> 00:52:49.100
Oh! Sorry. Sorry.

1024
00:52:49.233 --> 00:52:50.200
Sorry.

1025
00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:57.767
Woah.

1026
00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.367
Ok. don't make fun.

1027
00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:03.367
I'm not. Not at all.

1028
00:53:09.066 --> 00:53:11.100
You're really talented.

1029
00:53:11.233 --> 00:53:12.700
Ok.

1030
00:53:12.834 --> 00:53:14.333
I mean it.

1031
00:53:20.667 --> 00:53:24.333
Piper. I want you to do
the illustrations

1032
00:53:24.467 --> 00:53:26.200
for the book pitch.

1033
00:53:26.333 --> 00:53:27.567
What?

1034
00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:29.867
I can't believe I didn't realize
this sooner.

1035
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.667
I mean. look at these drawings.
They're fun and imaginative.

1036
00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:35.000
You'd be perfect
for the book.

1037
00:53:35.133 --> 00:53:38.233
That's a crazy idea and also

1038
00:53:38.367 --> 00:53:40.734
I couldn't possibly illustrate
an entire book in two weeks.

1039
00:53:40.867 --> 00:53:42.266
Just sketches

1040
00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.400
for the key moments of
the presentation. that's it.

1041
00:53:44.533 --> 00:53:46.500
Well. what if they reject
your book

1042
00:53:46.633 --> 00:53:48.066
because they don't like
my work?

1043
00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.433
This is your one shot.

1044
00:53:49.567 --> 00:53:52.266
You should really find
a professional artist.

1045
00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.734
Maybe you are a
professional artist.

1046
00:53:54.867 --> 00:53:57.767
Maybe this is exactly
what you've been looking for.

1047
00:53:57.900 --> 00:54:00.934
I know you feel the need to have
a steady job that's dependable.

1048
00:54:01.066 --> 00:54:03.233
but you've tried
everything else out.

1049
00:54:03.367 --> 00:54:05.166
Why don't you try
doing something

1050
00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:06.834
you actually love doing?

1051
00:54:07.934 --> 00:54:10.433
That is very flattering.

1052
00:54:10.567 --> 00:54:14.266
But my time in New York
is running out

1053
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:18.333
and I really need to focus
on my long term.

1054
00:54:18.467 --> 00:54:20.233
Doesn't mean you have
to stop looking.

1055
00:54:20.367 --> 00:54:23.266
Come on. this will be like
a fun little side thing.

1056
00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:24.400
Come on.

1057
00:54:26.533 --> 00:54:29.100
Wait a second.
do you hear that?

1058
00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:31.734
What?

1059
00:54:31.867 --> 00:54:32.967
That sound. you
can't hear that?

1060
00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:34.800
No...

1061
00:54:34.934 --> 00:54:37.066
It's adventure calling.

1062
00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:39.500
Are you going to answer it
or not?

1063
00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:44.066
Come on.

1064
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:51.133
You know. I. uh. I think
I hear it now.

1065
00:54:51.266 --> 00:54:52.900
What do you say?

1066
00:54:53.033 --> 00:54:54.333
You and me.

1067
00:54:56.767 --> 00:54:58.633
Ok. I'll do it.

1068
00:54:58.767 --> 00:55:00.800
Just for fun.

1069
00:55:02.667 --> 00:55:03.734
For fun.

1070
00:55:18.033 --> 00:55:21.834
"I'd love to meet at 11:00.
Arnold."

1071
00:55:21.967 --> 00:55:24.367
Wonderful. see you then.

1072
00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:25.834
Ok.

1073
00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:31.834
Hey. Mom and Dad.

1074
00:55:31.967 --> 00:55:34.166
Piper! We haven't heard from you
in so long.

1075
00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.066
I know. I've just been
really busy.

1076
00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.000
Look. I actually gotta go.

1077
00:55:38.133 --> 00:55:40.533
Wait. didn't you forget
something yesterday?

1078
00:55:40.667 --> 00:55:44.133
Oh. it was your anniversary!
I completely forgot.

1079
00:55:44.266 --> 00:55:46.700
I've just been so busy
and I was working yesterday

1080
00:55:46.834 --> 00:55:49.200
and then I had a dinner
and that ran late.

1081
00:55:49.333 --> 00:55:50.667
Sorry.

1082
00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:52.734
It... it's ok. honey.
We know you're busy.

1083
00:55:52.867 --> 00:55:56.400
I'm sure that job of yours has
you running all over the city.

1084
00:55:56.533 --> 00:55:58.834
Actually. that job
didn't end up panning out.

1085
00:55:58.967 --> 00:55:59.967
You got fired?

1086
00:56:00.166 --> 00:56:01.567
It wasn't like that.

1087
00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:04.066
Don't worry. I'll work
something else out.

1088
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.633
You keep saying that and
it keeps not working out.

1089
00:56:06.767 --> 00:56:08.700
You had a perfectly good job
at the family business

1090
00:56:08.834 --> 00:56:10.066
and it wasn't good enough.

1091
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.233
Dad. that is not fair.

1092
00:56:12.367 --> 00:56:14.734
It's not that it wasn't
good enough.

1093
00:56:14.867 --> 00:56:18.100
I just need to find a life
that's right for me.

1094
00:56:18.233 --> 00:56:20.734
And I hope someday
you can support that.

1095
00:56:20.867 --> 00:56:23.133
But I really gotta go.
Love you.

1096
00:56:26.166 --> 00:56:29.266
They just miss you
and care about you a lot.

1097
00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:31.100
Well. if they want to show
that they care

1098
00:56:31.233 --> 00:56:33.700
they should support me
being out here.

1099
00:56:33.834 --> 00:56:35.300
You know. when I told
my parents

1100
00:56:35.433 --> 00:56:38.934
I was moving to New York.
they didn't take it well.

1101
00:56:39.066 --> 00:56:41.700
And then. when I came out
in the same conversation.

1102
00:56:41.834 --> 00:56:43.467
they really didn't
take it well.

1103
00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:44.867
But that didn't stop me
from building

1104
00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.100
a life I wanted for myself.

1105
00:56:47.233 --> 00:56:50.266
And. you know. eventually
they came around.

1106
00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:53.533
So. you shouldn't let anything
stop you either.

1107
00:56:53.667 --> 00:56:59.133
Thank you for sharing that.
I won't.

1108
00:56:59.266 --> 00:57:03.166
You know. this café really
became a home for us

1109
00:57:03.300 --> 00:57:07.500
once we started to give it
a personal touch.

1110
00:57:07.633 --> 00:57:11.133
So. now it's your turn
to make a contribution.

1111
00:57:11.266 --> 00:57:14.200
I don't have anything
to contribute.

1112
00:57:14.333 --> 00:57:15.433
Of course you do.

1113
00:57:15.567 --> 00:57:17.600
Your art would look great
on the wall.

1114
00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:26.367
There was this one little sketch
I was kind of working on.

1115
00:57:27.934 --> 00:57:29.266
No way.

1116
00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:32.200
The café?

1117
00:57:34.166 --> 00:57:36.300
Oh. I love it.

1118
00:57:36.433 --> 00:57:37.834
We'll get this framed right up

1119
00:57:37.967 --> 00:57:40.266
and then this place can start
to feel like yours too.

1120
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:51.033
Well. Patricia said
I would enjoy meeting you.

1121
00:57:51.166 --> 00:57:55.266
She was right.
You're a breath of fresh air.

1122
00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:56.867
I'd love to hire you
as a greeter.

1123
00:57:57.900 --> 00:57:59.033
Really?

1124
00:57:59.166 --> 00:58:00.500
It's only part time
and I know it's beneath

1125
00:58:00.633 --> 00:58:03.633
your experience level but
it's yours if you want it.

1126
00:58:03.767 --> 00:58:06.233
That would be wonderful.

1127
00:58:11.567 --> 00:58:13.400
It's just a greeting position

1128
00:58:13.533 --> 00:58:15.000
but I'm really looking
forward to it.

1129
00:58:15.133 --> 00:58:16.667
It's a foot in the door.

1130
00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:20.066
It's oddly comfortable
wedged in there.

1131
00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.667
How was your day?

1132
00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:24.934
Spent anxiously anticipating
your thoughts on my book.

1133
00:58:25.066 --> 00:58:26.467
Oh my gosh.
It was great.

1134
00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:28.300
Truly.

1135
00:58:28.433 --> 00:58:32.800
It was funny and imaginative
but what I really loved the most

1136
00:58:32.934 --> 00:58:35.300
was your point of view
on loneliness.

1137
00:58:35.433 --> 00:58:37.133
Really?

1138
00:58:37.266 --> 00:58:39.800
About how all the wishes in
the world don't mean anything

1139
00:58:39.934 --> 00:58:42.767
if you don't have anybody
to share it with.

1140
00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:44.333
I have so many ideas
for some sketches.

1141
00:58:44.467 --> 00:58:45.900
I'm feeling very inspired.

1142
00:58:46.033 --> 00:58:47.967
Me too. I've been
writing up a storm.

1143
00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:49.900
Can't wait to show you.

1144
00:58:50.033 --> 00:58:52.100
Do you. um. you want
to meet up tonight?

1145
00:58:52.233 --> 00:58:53.500
Definitely.

1146
00:58:55.567 --> 00:58:57.400
Ooh. which one of these
will best set the mood

1147
00:58:57.533 --> 00:58:59.333
for toiling away
by candlelight?

1148
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:03.867
What? I'm a writer.
you're an artist.

1149
00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.467
goes with the territory.

1150
00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:07.834
Hey. I know you're joking.

1151
00:59:07.967 --> 00:59:11.333
but don't underestimate
the power of a good candle.

1152
00:59:11.467 --> 00:59:13.900
I would never joke about
Perfectly Persimmon.

1153
00:59:15.834 --> 00:59:17.467
It's. um. refreshing.

1154
00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.400
Eh. not the word I'd use.

1155
00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:21.667
Oooh...

1156
00:59:23.867 --> 00:59:26.700
Apple pie.
Mm-mm-mm.

1157
00:59:26.834 --> 00:59:27.900
And that is a classic.

1158
00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:32.233
You can have that one
all to yourself.

1159
00:59:32.367 --> 00:59:38.066
Hm. What about Autumn
Woodland?

1160
00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:40.300
Now that's uh.
that's perfect.

1161
00:59:42.767 --> 00:59:45.467
Oh wow.
That is perfect.

1162
00:59:46.834 --> 00:59:49.066
I um. I should. um. get back
to the gallery.

1163
00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.867
My shift starts soon.

1164
00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.533
Right. yeah. yeah.
foot in the door.

1165
00:59:52.667 --> 00:59:55.033
You just gotta break down the
hinges and walk right through.

1166
00:59:55.166 --> 00:59:58.500
Yes. Right. exactly.
I... I will see you tonight.

1167
00:59:58.633 --> 00:59:59.900
You bet.

1168
01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:05.500
I will take one of those.
thank you.

1169
01:00:11.767 --> 01:00:13.367
What do you think?

1170
01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:15.734
Well I'm not usually one
for abstract art.

1171
01:00:15.867 --> 01:00:18.867
I can never tell what
it's supposed to mean.

1172
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.367
I used to think
the same thing

1173
01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:24.900
but then I realized
that's what makes it unique.

1174
01:00:25.033 --> 01:00:27.834
Like. where the brushstrokes meet.

1175
01:00:27.967 --> 01:00:29.967
What does that make
you think of?

1176
01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.233
The horizon?

1177
01:00:32.367 --> 01:00:35.033
And those bursts of color?

1178
01:00:35.166 --> 01:00:38.400
Two people watching a sunset.

1179
01:00:38.533 --> 01:00:41.400
I love it.
A bit of romance in the air.

1180
01:00:43.300 --> 01:00:45.867
What do you see?

1181
01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:50.700
A woman looking at the future
version of herself.

1182
01:00:50.834 --> 01:00:54.800
At what she could become if
she were brave enough to try.

1183
01:00:59.033 --> 01:01:01.033
Well done. Piper.

1184
01:01:01.166 --> 01:01:03.700
I've been trying to sell
this piece for ages.

1185
01:01:03.834 --> 01:01:05.567
You have a real eye for art.

1186
01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.066
I was just describing
what I saw.

1187
01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:12.100
Well. I see someone who just
made 10 percent commission.

1188
01:01:12.233 --> 01:01:14.100
That's not necessary.

1189
01:01:14.233 --> 01:01:15.867
You earned it.

1190
01:02:39.266 --> 01:02:40.200
Are you sure you don't want

1191
01:02:40.333 --> 01:02:42.433
to rethink illustration
as a career?

1192
01:02:42.567 --> 01:02:44.166
You're really good.

1193
01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:45.266
Thanks.

1194
01:02:46.934 --> 01:02:48.367
Wow!

1195
01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:50.000
It's the first time

1196
01:02:50.133 --> 01:02:53.333
you haven't shrugged off a
compliment about your art.

1197
01:02:53.467 --> 01:02:57.500
I have to admit. I really love
creating these illustrations.

1198
01:02:57.633 --> 01:02:58.834
I wake up every morning

1199
01:02:58.967 --> 01:03:02.166
and I can't wait to start
working on them.

1200
01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:06.100
And. um. you can keep
the compliments coming.

1201
01:03:06.233 --> 01:03:08.400
You can say it again.

1202
01:03:10.166 --> 01:03:11.500
You're really good.

1203
01:03:11.633 --> 01:03:14.367
And again.

1204
01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:18.066
You're really. really good.

1205
01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.367
And I can't imagine my book
without you.

1206
01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.767
You're really good too.
you know that?

1207
01:03:33.066 --> 01:03:34.667
It's... it's getting late.

1208
01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:37.667
I should...
I should probably get going.

1209
01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.066
Right. yeah.

1210
01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:40.367
Yeah.

1211
01:03:44.734 --> 01:03:45.934
I'll uh...

1212
01:03:48.233 --> 01:03:49.900
- Good night.
- Yeah. good night.

1213
01:03:50.033 --> 01:03:51.000
Yeah.

1214
01:03:52.867 --> 01:03:53.934
Ok.

1215
01:03:54.967 --> 01:03:56.667
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

1216
01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.333
Uh. where's the portfolio?

1217
01:04:15.133 --> 01:04:16.567
And where are the backup
flash cards?

1218
01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:18.867
- Oh. I threw them out.
- What?

1219
01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:21.533
Just kidding.
Just breathe.

1220
01:04:21.667 --> 01:04:22.700
You're gonna be great.

1221
01:04:22.834 --> 01:04:24.533
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

1222
01:04:24.667 --> 01:04:28.033
Just go in there and invite her
into the world of your story.

1223
01:04:28.166 --> 01:04:29.800
Show her the spark
that inspired you

1224
01:04:29.934 --> 01:04:31.367
and I know she'll
feel it too.

1225
01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:32.967
What if she doesn't like
what she feels?

1226
01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:35.367
That's impossible because
it comes from the heart

1227
01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:36.734
and your work is strong.

1228
01:04:36.867 --> 01:04:38.633
Our work is strong

1229
01:04:38.767 --> 01:04:40.800
and I couldn't have done it
without you.

1230
01:04:40.934 --> 01:04:42.000
I'll make sure the publisher
knows that.

1231
01:04:42.133 --> 01:04:43.066
Mm.

1232
01:04:44.533 --> 01:04:46.367
Here goes nothing.

1233
01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.800
Here goes everything.

1234
01:04:56.166 --> 01:04:59.467
Well. Austin. we've got nothing
like it on our slate

1235
01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:02.400
and we'd like to publish it.

1236
01:05:02.533 --> 01:05:04.100
Wow.

1237
01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:07.467
I am just going to bask in
this feeling for a moment.

1238
01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.734
I'll have our contracts
department work out the details.

1239
01:05:09.867 --> 01:05:11.900
From there.
we'll discuss timeline

1240
01:05:12.033 --> 01:05:13.600
and an illustrator we can
pair you with.

1241
01:05:13.734 --> 01:05:16.934
Oh. I was planning on keeping
the original illustrator.

1242
01:05:17.066 --> 01:05:19.734
The... the one who worked on
the pitch samples. Piper Grant.

1243
01:05:19.867 --> 01:05:22.700
Her work was good.
but as a debut author.

1244
01:05:22.834 --> 01:05:23.900
we'll pair you with

1245
01:05:24.033 --> 01:05:25.367
a recognizable. established artist.

1246
01:05:25.500 --> 01:05:26.567
But she. she really.

1247
01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:28.433
she really brought
these books to life.

1248
01:05:28.567 --> 01:05:30.033
Her work is perfect
for the book.

1249
01:05:30.166 --> 01:05:32.633
The choice of illustrator
is the publisher's decision.

1250
01:05:32.767 --> 01:05:35.033
That's just how it's done.

1251
01:05:35.166 --> 01:05:37.633
I understand. but she really
is the real deal.

1252
01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.033
I can assure you.

1253
01:05:39.166 --> 01:05:41.767
we will find someone
whose work you will love.

1254
01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:44.200
But. for now. go. Celebrate.

1255
01:05:44.333 --> 01:05:46.233
You just sold
your first series.

1256
01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:52.633
Congratulations. Austin.
Congratulations. Piper.

1257
01:05:52.767 --> 01:05:55.400
This is huge.
You've hit the big time.

1258
01:05:55.533 --> 01:05:56.600
We need to celebrate.

1259
01:05:56.734 --> 01:05:57.767
Isn't that what we're doing?

1260
01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:59.367
No. this is a pre-celebration.

1261
01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.033
I'm throwing you a party
next week.

1262
01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:02.667
But you're already planning
one for Piper's birthday.

1263
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:05.834
Well. I can party plan
multi-task. obviously.

1264
01:06:05.967 --> 01:06:08.667
So what did your mom say when
you told her about the book?

1265
01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:11.133
Oh. I haven't told her yet.

1266
01:06:11.266 --> 01:06:12.300
Why not?

1267
01:06:12.433 --> 01:06:13.667
It seems like
perfect vindication.

1268
01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.967
Well. I never told her I got
fired from the paper.

1269
01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.834
Austin... you gotta
come clean.

1270
01:06:18.967 --> 01:06:21.033
I promise I will soon.

1271
01:06:23.233 --> 01:06:26.600
Well. enough celebrating.
Back to work.

1272
01:06:26.734 --> 01:06:28.700
Such a party pooper.

1273
01:06:28.834 --> 01:06:30.433
I've got dough rising

1274
01:06:30.567 --> 01:06:31.800
and it's gonna take over the
kitchen if I don't get back.

1275
01:06:34.333 --> 01:06:38.800
So. um. did they say if they had
a favorite illustration?

1276
01:06:38.934 --> 01:06:40.433
Um. yeah. yeah.

1277
01:06:40.567 --> 01:06:44.300
No. I think she... I think she
liked them all.

1278
01:06:44.433 --> 01:06:47.600
I just want to say thank you
for talking me into this.

1279
01:06:47.734 --> 01:06:50.200
You really were my champion.

1280
01:06:50.333 --> 01:06:52.767
And to think...

1281
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:55.934
my calling was right there in
front of me this entire time.

1282
01:06:56.066 --> 01:06:57.166
Yeah. yeah.

1283
01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:59.333
But um. make sure
you think it through.

1284
01:06:59.467 --> 01:07:01.500
It's a big step.

1285
01:07:01.633 --> 01:07:03.367
Yeah. it is and you know.

1286
01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:07.567
it's scary to leave
the security of a 9-5.

1287
01:07:07.700 --> 01:07:10.400
but I've just got to trust
that if I'm doing what I love

1288
01:07:10.533 --> 01:07:12.667
then everything else
will fall into place.

1289
01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:17.266
So take it slow. you know?
Don't quit your day job.

1290
01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:21.000
Why don't you show your boss
your work at the gallery?

1291
01:07:21.133 --> 01:07:22.767
Seriously?

1292
01:07:22.900 --> 01:07:24.367
Yeah. would be a good way for
you to get your name out there.

1293
01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.867
I mean. you helped sell
a book series.

1294
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.367
It's about time you started
promoting yourself.

1295
01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:31.233
You're right.

1296
01:07:31.367 --> 01:07:35.367
It suddenly feels like the whole
world is opening its doors.

1297
01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.600
Like I've been struck by
a bolt of lightning.

1298
01:07:42.166 --> 01:07:43.500
Cheers.

1299
01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.233
Piper. the paintings
for the new exhibit

1300
01:07:53.367 --> 01:07:55.000
are coming in Monday.

1301
01:07:55.133 --> 01:07:57.500
I thought you could help decide
on wall placement.

1302
01:07:57.633 --> 01:07:59.066
You have such a good eye.

1303
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.834
I'd be happy to help.

1304
01:08:00.967 --> 01:08:02.000
Excellent.

1305
01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:11.066
Hey. um. Arnold. I was hoping
I could ask for a favor.

1306
01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.333
I don't know if I
mentioned it before

1307
01:08:12.467 --> 01:08:14.567
but I actually do sketching
in my spare time.

1308
01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:15.567
Oh.

1309
01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:16.934
My work was recently used

1310
01:08:17.066 --> 01:08:19.266
to help sell a book
at Snowburry Publishing

1311
01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.300
and I was hoping I could get
your professional opinion

1312
01:08:21.433 --> 01:08:22.967
on my portfolio.

1313
01:08:23.100 --> 01:08:24.333
It'd be my pleasure.

1314
01:08:24.467 --> 01:08:25.667
Why don't you leave a copy
of your work

1315
01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:27.066
and I'll look at it
this weekend.

1316
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.433
That would be great.
Thank you.

1317
01:09:09.834 --> 01:09:11.333
Piper...

1318
01:09:11.467 --> 01:09:12.967
Mom. hi.

1319
01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:14.467
Two days in a row.
Wow. I actually-

1320
01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:16.033
I was in midtown
and I thought

1321
01:09:16.166 --> 01:09:19.400
I would stop by the paper
and visit my son at work

1322
01:09:19.533 --> 01:09:23.033
but imagine my surprise
when I discover

1323
01:09:23.166 --> 01:09:26.133
that there's no longer an Austin
Edwards employed there.

1324
01:09:26.266 --> 01:09:27.700
I have great news.

1325
01:09:27.834 --> 01:09:31.367
I thought. surely there must be
some sort of mistake.

1326
01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.200
Until your boss told me
about the late articles.

1327
01:09:34.333 --> 01:09:37.000
the sub-par work and that
you were fired.

1328
01:09:37.133 --> 01:09:38.333
I know.

1329
01:09:38.467 --> 01:09:41.800
Everything I have done
has been to help you

1330
01:09:41.934 --> 01:09:43.700
develop the skills you need
to succeed.

1331
01:09:43.834 --> 01:09:44.734
I know.

1332
01:09:44.867 --> 01:09:46.467
And at this point. I just.

1333
01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.000
I don't know what more
I can do for you.

1334
01:09:55.266 --> 01:09:58.133
This retrospective
for your mom is a big deal.

1335
01:09:58.266 --> 01:10:00.367
Come on. just come inside.

1336
01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.533
Could be your birthday present
to me.

1337
01:10:02.667 --> 01:10:04.467
It's not your birthday
until tomorrow.

1338
01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.567
Well. I'm currently
accepting gifts.

1339
01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:09.233
Or. leads on a new sublet.

1340
01:10:09.367 --> 01:10:10.700
I don't know about this.

1341
01:10:10.834 --> 01:10:12.400
I doubt she even wants me
in there.

1342
01:10:12.533 --> 01:10:15.233
It was a heated moment.
I'm sure she didn't mean it.

1343
01:10:15.367 --> 01:10:17.700
She wasn't wrong.
I hurt her.

1344
01:10:17.834 --> 01:10:21.367
I knew what I was doing
and I kept doing it anyway.

1345
01:10:21.500 --> 01:10:24.533
So apologize. and then share
with her the good news

1346
01:10:24.667 --> 01:10:26.333
about the book.

1347
01:10:26.467 --> 01:10:29.000
She'll be proud.
Come on. trust me.

1348
01:10:29.133 --> 01:10:30.133
Ok.

1349
01:10:32.633 --> 01:10:34.166
So. there we were.
sitting in the Jeep

1350
01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:35.834
in the middle of
the dessert

1351
01:10:35.967 --> 01:10:37.867
and the prince says.

1352
01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.467
"You have been chasing me
for days!

1353
01:10:40.600 --> 01:10:42.700
"You never give up. Enough!"

1354
01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:47.166
And that is how I got
the famous interview.

1355
01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:49.367
I never gave up.

1356
01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.567
So thank you for coming.

1357
01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:53.500
It is wonderful to see
you all.

1358
01:10:53.633 --> 01:10:57.000
Have a lovely evening
and enjoy the party.

1359
01:10:58.633 --> 01:11:01.400
Thank you. I am so glad
you made it.

1360
01:11:01.533 --> 01:11:04.567
Mom. I'm really sorry.
I never meant to hurt you.

1361
01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.700
Can we please
just talk about it?

1362
01:11:06.834 --> 01:11:08.867
I have some really
great news.

1363
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.600
Sweetheart. I've had
an amazing career.

1364
01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:15.367
And I've achieved more
than I could have dreamed.

1365
01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:19.734
But the one thing I never got
right was how to be your mother.

1366
01:11:19.867 --> 01:11:22.433
And it breaks my heart
that I failed you.

1367
01:11:22.567 --> 01:11:24.266
You didn't. Mom.

1368
01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.767
I'm just trying to carve
my own path.

1369
01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:28.934
That's not failing me.

1370
01:11:29.066 --> 01:11:30.467
It is to me.

1371
01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.734
Ms. Edwards...

1372
01:11:36.867 --> 01:11:40.100
I think you should know
that Austin sold his book.

1373
01:11:40.233 --> 01:11:43.300
And not just one book.
but an entire series.

1374
01:11:43.433 --> 01:11:45.900
It goes back to what you said
about your parents.

1375
01:11:46.033 --> 01:11:48.967
If you could just see
what Austin created.

1376
01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:50.633
hold it as something tangible...

1377
01:11:50.767 --> 01:11:55.300
I know you mean well but Austin
has a lot to answer for.

1378
01:11:57.266 --> 01:11:58.900
Patricia!
Congratulations!

1379
01:11:59.033 --> 01:11:59.900
Oh!

1380
01:12:00.100 --> 01:12:01.033
What an incredible night.

1381
01:12:01.166 --> 01:12:02.500
Thank you. Alan.

1382
01:12:02.633 --> 01:12:05.633
You know. again. I am so sorry
the way my son acted.

1383
01:12:05.767 --> 01:12:08.033
You did me a huge favor
hiring him.

1384
01:12:08.166 --> 01:12:09.867
I couldn't be more embarrassed.

1385
01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:11.166
Don't even think about it.

1386
01:12:11.300 --> 01:12:12.533
Austin sent me the most
beautiful apology note

1387
01:12:12.667 --> 01:12:14.467
owning all his mistakes.

1388
01:12:14.600 --> 01:12:16.033
He's a good guy.

1389
01:12:17.567 --> 01:12:18.433
Congratulations.

1390
01:12:21.233 --> 01:12:22.767
Hi. Piper. It's Arnold.

1391
01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:24.633
I had a chance to review
your work.

1392
01:12:24.767 --> 01:12:27.033
It's sweet but
not really suited

1393
01:12:27.166 --> 01:12:29.367
for the New York
art gallery scene.

1394
01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:40.967
There you are!

1395
01:12:42.633 --> 01:12:45.166
My mom is never gonna see me
for who I am.

1396
01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:46.934
Let alone support me.

1397
01:12:47.066 --> 01:12:48.467
Don't be so sure.

1398
01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:50.467
When she sees the wonderful
books we're creating.

1399
01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.633
she'll feel differently.

1400
01:12:52.767 --> 01:12:54.700
Just another reason we have
to work super hard.

1401
01:12:56.934 --> 01:12:57.934
Piper...

1402
01:13:00.166 --> 01:13:02.834
I don't know how to tell
you this...

1403
01:13:02.967 --> 01:13:04.700
The publisher isn't going
to use you

1404
01:13:04.834 --> 01:13:06.600
as an illustrator
on the book.

1405
01:13:08.967 --> 01:13:10.700
What do you mean?

1406
01:13:10.834 --> 01:13:13.433
She wants to use someone
more established.

1407
01:13:13.567 --> 01:13:15.767
That's why I tried to convince
you to show Arnold your work.

1408
01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:17.900
so that maybe you could get
some gallery recognition

1409
01:13:18.033 --> 01:13:22.266
and that your work
would gain value.

1410
01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:28.100
Right. 'Cause my work
has no value.

1411
01:13:28.233 --> 01:13:29.500
Of course it does.

1412
01:13:32.967 --> 01:13:36.200
I um... I gotta. I gotta go.

1413
01:13:36.333 --> 01:13:37.600
Piper...

1414
01:14:14.467 --> 01:14:17.166
Happy birthday to me.

1415
01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:13.266
Thank you.

1416
01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:16.066
I'm really gonna miss
you guys.

1417
01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:17.166
Oh.

1418
01:15:18.433 --> 01:15:19.800
I couldn't have asked
for better friends.

1419
01:15:19.934 --> 01:15:22.433
Please stay for
your birthday party.

1420
01:15:22.567 --> 01:15:27.734
I uh. I would love to
but I gotta be realistic.

1421
01:15:27.867 --> 01:15:30.400
My two months is up
and I took my shot.

1422
01:15:30.533 --> 01:15:32.266
and it just didn't
work out.

1423
01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.767
But you worked so hard.

1424
01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:36.500
And just think about
all the jobs you tried.

1425
01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.934
You were such a champion.

1426
01:15:42.767 --> 01:15:45.133
Wait. say that again?

1427
01:15:45.266 --> 01:15:47.734
Um. you were a champion.

1428
01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:50.166
I...

1429
01:15:51.734 --> 01:15:53.967
No. um. would you. sorry.
open the back?

1430
01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:55.166
Open the...

1431
01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.934
Would you guys mind. um.
just watching this stuff

1432
01:16:00.133 --> 01:16:01.033
for a little while?

1433
01:16:01.166 --> 01:16:02.066
- Uh...
- Um...

1434
01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.667
So a bit of change
of plans.

1435
01:16:14.333 --> 01:16:16.066
Piper. you in there?

1436
01:16:27.867 --> 01:16:30.500
I've been thinking about
something that you told me.

1437
01:16:30.633 --> 01:16:34.533
About always being
my own champion.

1438
01:16:34.667 --> 01:16:36.066
So. I have a question.

1439
01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:37.133
Ask away.

1440
01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:43.467
I came to New York City
and I found my calling.

1441
01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.667
Which is?

1442
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.367
To be an illustrator.

1443
01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.700
Here in the city
that inspires me.

1444
01:16:48.834 --> 01:16:52.400
That's wonderful. Piper.
So. what's your question?

1445
01:16:52.533 --> 01:16:56.867
You said that you need to be
your own champion.

1446
01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:00.300
You said that you always need
to fight for yourself.

1447
01:17:00.433 --> 01:17:04.200
Well. I have and I've failed.

1448
01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:07.633
So my question is. how do I know
if the universe is telling me

1449
01:17:07.767 --> 01:17:12.066
that it's time to give up or
if I just need to fight harder?

1450
01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.300
What makes you think
you've failed?

1451
01:17:14.433 --> 01:17:16.200
Every door that I tried
to get through

1452
01:17:16.333 --> 01:17:18.433
just keeps getting slammed
in my face.

1453
01:17:18.567 --> 01:17:21.400
It's so frustrating.

1454
01:17:21.533 --> 01:17:24.567
I... I can't get hired
because I'm unknown

1455
01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:25.900
and I can't become known

1456
01:17:26.033 --> 01:17:29.533
unless I'm hired and I don't
know what to do.

1457
01:17:29.667 --> 01:17:31.767
Piper. how do you think
established people

1458
01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:34.066
get established?

1459
01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:37.367
If a door gets closed.
you bust it down.

1460
01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.800
If you don't do it.
someone else will.

1461
01:17:39.934 --> 01:17:43.033
Either you believe in yourself
or you don't.

1462
01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:54.767
Well aren't you going to stay
for tea?

1463
01:17:54.900 --> 01:17:56.133
Thank you for the offer

1464
01:17:56.266 --> 01:18:01.533
but I've got some
door-busting to do.

1465
01:18:01.667 --> 01:18:03.633
You're amazing.
by the way.

1466
01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.033
Hey. Will!

1467
01:18:10.166 --> 01:18:11.700
Have either of you guys
seen Piper?

1468
01:18:11.834 --> 01:18:12.934
She was just heading
to the airport

1469
01:18:13.066 --> 01:18:13.967
and then she suddenly changed
her mind.

1470
01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:15.000
Where'd she go?

1471
01:18:15.133 --> 01:18:16.667
No idea.

1472
01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:19.333
The only thing we do know
is that she is coming back

1473
01:18:19.467 --> 01:18:21.300
before she leaves again.

1474
01:18:29.767 --> 01:18:32.166
Ms. Snowburry?

1475
01:18:32.300 --> 01:18:37.500
My name is Piper Grant and no.
I don't have an appointment.

1476
01:18:37.633 --> 01:18:40.367
but I'm gonna ask for
three minutes of your time.

1477
01:18:40.500 --> 01:18:42.600
And why would I give you
any time at all?

1478
01:18:42.734 --> 01:18:45.467
Because I'm an illustrator.

1479
01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:50.767
I'm not established. my work
is not recognizable.

1480
01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:54.100
Actually. no one has ever
heard of me.

1481
01:18:54.233 --> 01:18:59.700
But they will.
Because I'm good.

1482
01:18:59.834 --> 01:19:03.166
I am really. really good.

1483
01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:08.033
I'm such an idiot.

1484
01:19:08.166 --> 01:19:09.767
There's gotta be a way
to fix this.

1485
01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:10.834
Fix what?

1486
01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:13.867
I've been terribly unfair
to Piper.

1487
01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.266
She's worked so hard
on this book.

1488
01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.266
You really like this girl.

1489
01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.333
Told you.

1490
01:19:21.533 --> 01:19:23.567
I should have pushed
for her harder.

1491
01:19:23.700 --> 01:19:25.266
Maybe you still can?

1492
01:19:28.967 --> 01:19:30.200
You turned down
my illustrations

1493
01:19:30.333 --> 01:19:32.734
for Austin Edwards'
new book series

1494
01:19:32.867 --> 01:19:35.533
but I'm wondering if you
really looked at my work

1495
01:19:35.667 --> 01:19:37.166
or you just dismissed it
out of hand

1496
01:19:37.300 --> 01:19:38.834
because I'm unknown.

1497
01:19:38.967 --> 01:19:41.700
It's not personal.
It's company policy.

1498
01:19:41.834 --> 01:19:43.367
We use established illustrators

1499
01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:45.367
who's work we know
is outstanding.

1500
01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.867
Fair enough.

1501
01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.266
But I'm gonna ask you to look
again and if you don't think

1502
01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:56.533
it is outstanding and absolutely
perfect for the series.

1503
01:19:56.667 --> 01:19:59.433
then I will thank you for
your time and I will leave.

1504
01:20:04.867 --> 01:20:06.166
Fair enough.

Where've you been?

1510
01:20:34.133 --> 01:20:35.700
You were just gonna up and
leave without saying goodbye?

1511
01:20:35.834 --> 01:20:38.233
I knew if I saw you it would
make leaving that much harder.

1512
01:20:38.367 --> 01:20:40.400
Look. I called the publisher.

1513
01:20:40.533 --> 01:20:42.734
I did what I should have done
in the first place.

1514
01:20:42.867 --> 01:20:45.066
I told her we're
a package deal.

1515
01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.734
And what did she say?

1516
01:20:46.867 --> 01:20:48.934
She said I was too late.

1517
01:20:49.066 --> 01:20:51.266
She already found an illustrator
who'd be perfect for the book.

1518
01:20:53.166 --> 01:20:54.266
You.

1519
01:20:57.333 --> 01:20:58.400
We did it.

1520
01:20:58.533 --> 01:21:00.166
No. you did it.

1521
01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.934
What did you even say
to her?

1522
01:21:04.066 --> 01:21:07.166
I took some advice
from a very wise woman.

1523
01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:09.633
And I doubled down
on myself.

1524
01:21:09.767 --> 01:21:11.633
So does that mean
you're gonna stay?

1525

or the world's best hot dog.

or even the autumn leaves.

1527
01:21:15.433 --> 01:21:17.333
which. I admit. you're right.
They're great.

1528
01:21:20.266 --> 01:21:25.433
But stay because this place is
more magical with you in it.

1529
01:21:25.567 --> 01:21:27.600

without you.
