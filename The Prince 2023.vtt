3
00:00:27.078 --> 00:00:31.869
So shaken as we are. so wan with care

4
00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.319
find we a time for frighted peace to pant

5
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.729
and breathe short-winded
accents of new broils

6
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.359
to be commenced in strands afar remote.

7
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.319
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil

8
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.971
shall daub her lips with
her own children's blood

9
00:00:51.972 --> 00:00:56.199
nor more shall trenching
war channel her field

10
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.954
nor bruise her flowerets
with the armèd hoofs

11
00:00:59.955 --> 00:01:04.357
of hostile paces: those opposèd eyes

12
00:01:04.358 --> 00:01:07.456
which. like the meteors
of a troubled heaven

13
00:01:07.457 --> 00:01:10.179
all of one nature. of one substance bred

14
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.999
did lately meet in the intestine shock

15
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.579
and furious close of civil butchery

16
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.209
shall now. in mutual well-beseeming ranks

17
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.326
march all one way

18
00:01:23.476 --> 00:01:25.933
and be no more opposed

19
00:01:25.934 --> 00:01:28.495
against acquaintance

20
00:01:28.496 --> 00:01:29.329
kindred

21
00:01:30.688 --> 00:01:32.012
and allies.

22
00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.149
The edge of war. like
an ill-sheathèd knife

23
00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.849
no more shall cut his master.

24
00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.649
Therefore. friends

25
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.274
as far as to the sepulchre of Christ

26
00:01:45.275 --> 00:01:49.779
forthwith a power of English shall we levy

27
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.109
whose arms were moulded
in their mothers' womb

28
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.273
to chase those pagans
from those holy fields.

29
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.531
But this our purpose
now is twelve month old

30
00:02:03.532 --> 00:02:05.259
and bootless 'tis to tell you we will go

31
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.669
therefore we meet not now.

32
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.469
Then let me hear from you. my
noble lord and loyal friend

33
00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.349
what yesternight our council did decree

34
00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.479
in forwarding this dear expedience.

35
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.059
My liege. this haste was hot in question

36
00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.979
and many limits of the charge set down

37
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.976
but yesternight: when
all athwart there came

38
00:02:25.977 --> 00:02:29.617
a post from Scotland.
leaden with grave news.

39
00:02:30.452 --> 00:02:34.254
On Holy-rood day. the
gallant Hotspur there

40
00:02:36.753 --> 00:02:39.444
and the Earl of Douglas

41
00:02:41.003 --> 00:02:45.594
that ever-valiant and approvèd
Scot. at Holmedon met!

42
00:02:47.587 --> 00:02:48.777
Ragh!

43
00:02:51.387 --> 00:02:53.575
Rrr-ragh!

44
00:02:53.576 --> 00:02:54.909
Lay on!

45
00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.761
Lay on ya wee and scrawny thing

46
00:02:56.762 --> 00:02:59.828
I've fought grandmothers
with more strength than ye!

47
00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.335
Those two did spend a sad

48
00:03:07.336 --> 00:03:08.769
and bloody hour

49
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.399
ten thousand bold Scots.
two and twenty knights

50
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.979
did our rider see on Holmedon's plains.

51
00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.899
If Harry Hotspur wins

52
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.307
it would be conquest for
a prince to boast of.

53
00:03:21.308 --> 00:03:22.283
Ragh!

54
00:03:24.602 --> 00:03:25.868
Raaagh!

55
00:03:28.095 --> 00:03:32.827
Yea. there thou makest me
sad and makest me sin in envy

56
00:03:32.828 --> 00:03:34.989
♪ that my Lord Northumberland

57
00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:39.109
should be the father to so blest a son

58
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.050
a son who is the theme of honour's tongue.

59
00:03:43.276 --> 00:03:46.359
Whilst I. by looking on the praise of him

60
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.729
see riot and dishonour stain
the brow of my young Harry.

61
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.689
On your feet. Prince Hal!

62
00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.329
These wars make men of us. Are you a man?

63
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.859
A spent one!

64
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.746
O. I cannot match thy
pace. my lungs will burst!

65
00:04:00.747 --> 00:04:02.588
Would I had never come from

66
00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:04.948
cosy London to this damnèd place!

67
00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:08.705
Then get thee to thy tent. I say. go to!

68
00:04:08.706 --> 00:04:11.755
We have no use for women on the field.

69
00:04:13.005 --> 00:04:14.537
O
that it could be proved

70
00:04:14.538 --> 00:04:16.843
that some night-tripping
fairy had exchanged

71
00:04:16.844 --> 00:04:19.993
Northumberland's child with
mine when they were born

72
00:04:19.994 --> 00:04:23.130
then would I have his Harry. and he mine.

73
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.582
It seems then that the
tidings of this broil

74
00:04:27.583 --> 00:04:29.715
brake off our business for the Holy Land

75
00:04:29.716 --> 00:04:31.817
and for this cause awhile
we should shake off

76
00:04:31.818 --> 00:04:33.558
our purpose for Jerusalem.

77
00:04:33.559 --> 00:04:36.549
Bring any word you hear. my noble friends

78
00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.447
of how the battle at our border stands.

79
00:04:39.448 --> 00:04:42.489
With Hotspur at its head I do not doubt

80
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:44.960
that soon we shall have victory and peace.

81
00:04:52.555 --> 00:04:54.761
I didn't understand
a bloody word of that!

82
00:04:56.103 --> 00:04:56.936
What's going on?

83
00:04:56.937 --> 00:04:58.034
It's okay. it's okay. you're all right!

84
00:04:58.035 --> 00:05:01.024
What is this? And who was that? And...

85
00:05:01.025 --> 00:05:01.858
Who are you?

86
00:05:01.858 --> 00:05:02.691
You're safe. it's okay!

87
00:05:02.692 --> 00:05:04.065
I'm a friend.

88
00:05:04.066 --> 00:05:05.619
Here. have some water.

89
00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.719
Right. I'm going to need
you to remain calm. okay?

90
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.652
Just take a deep breath. Come on.

91
00:05:10.495 --> 00:05:13.454
There you are. So. think
very carefully and calmly.

92
00:05:13.455 --> 00:05:16.063
Can you tell me. what is your name?

93
00:05:23.338 --> 00:05:24.354
Portia.

94
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.980
I'm Portia. I'm Brutus' wife. I have to...

95
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.519
You've ungently. Brutus

96
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.360
stole from my bed: and
yesternight. at supper

97
00:05:37.361 --> 00:05:39.989
you suddenly arose. and walk'd about--

98
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.823
Hello!

99
00:05:40.824 --> 00:05:44.133
Musing and sighing.
with your arms across

100
00:05:44.134 --> 00:05:45.466
and when I ask'd you

101
00:05:45.467 --> 00:05:46.302
what the matter was--

102
00:05:46.303 --> 00:05:47.319
No no no. stay with me. stay with me!

103
00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.929
I grant I am a woman; but withal

104
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.819
a woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.

105
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:55.329
I grant I am a woman; but withal

106
00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.911
a woman well-reputed. Cato's daughter--

107
00:05:57.912 --> 00:05:59.229
Snap out of it!

108
00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:00.063
Who are you?

109
00:06:00.064 --> 00:06:01.734
Just stay calm and think
very carefully and clearly

110
00:06:01.735 --> 00:06:04.179
and can you tell me. what is your name?

111
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.163
Portia?

112
00:06:05.164 --> 00:06:06.804
I'm Brutus' wife.

113
00:06:08.058 --> 00:06:09.298
Are you sure it's Portia?

114
00:06:09.299 --> 00:06:10.639
Are you sure you're married to Brutus

115
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.135
as in Ancient Roman Brutus

116
00:06:12.136 --> 00:06:14.469
as in best mates with
Julius Caesar Brutus?

117
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:16.149
Yes. I'm Portia.

118
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.720
I'm Brutus' wife.

119
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.789
What kind of bottle is that?

120
00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:22.759
Diet Coke.

121
00:06:24.198 --> 00:06:25.820
So. if you're from Ancient Rome

122
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:28.028
how do you recognise Diet Coke?

123
00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:29.547
What the fuck?

124
00:06:29.548 --> 00:06:30.805
It's okay! It's okay--

125
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.705
No no no no no.

126
00:06:38.696 --> 00:06:39.529
Jen!

127
00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:40.362
Jen?

128
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:45.084
Jen! My name is Jen!

129
00:06:45.085 --> 00:06:46.479
Oh. Jen! Jen. Jen. Jen!

130
00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.463
Oh my God. I completely
believed I was an Ancient Roman!

131
00:06:49.464 --> 00:06:52.179
Well. that's right. I rescued you.

132
00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.083
I'm Sam.

133
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.409
Or Sammy or Samantha.
whichever you prefer.

134
00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.049
I'm from Liverpool and I'm
a manager in a care home

135
00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.289
which is all arse holes and noses

136
00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.079
wiping arse holes and
wiping noses all day!

137
00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.825
Oh. but don't worry. I've
washed my hand since then.

138
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:15.157
Where am I?

139
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.136
Well. right now we're
somewhere between 'in the shit'

140
00:07:20.137 --> 00:07:21.612
and 'in harm's way.'

141
00:07:21.613 --> 00:07:23.187
Just...

142
00:07:23.188 --> 00:07:26.745
Keep your head down
and do what I tell you.

143
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.806
That was Scene One. It's about to change.

144
00:07:32.807 --> 00:07:34.190
Change? Into what?

145
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:36.485
1402. Northumberland.

146
00:07:36.486 --> 00:07:39.468
The Battle of Holmedon Hill!

147
00:07:40.485 --> 00:07:43.839
God's wounds. I thought
my sword fell hereabout!

148
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.899
Good nephew. in this
battle smoke and marsh

149
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.909
I fear to find it is impossible.

150
00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.249
I had it of my father years ago!

151
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.826
That wayward blade
hath done our noble cause

152
00:07:53.827 --> 00:07:55.633
great service. there's comfort.

153
00:07:55.634 --> 00:07:56.774
The Thane of Fife

154
00:07:56.775 --> 00:07:59.049
is taken as our prisoner. and Menteith.

155
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.299
I dare believe we may have victory!

156
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.809
The Earl of Douglas
yet evades our grasp.

157
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.212
He slipped by me when last our armies met

158
00:08:07.213 --> 00:08:09.581
at Otterburn. and left my brother dead.

159
00:08:11.206 --> 00:08:14.259
Good nephew. our knights
returning from their charge!

160
00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.366
The Scottish lines are
broken; we have won!

161
00:08:16.367 --> 00:08:17.915
Yet where is Douglas?

162
00:08:19.216 --> 00:08:22.804
- I cannot make him out.
- But here's a friendly face!

163
00:08:22.805 --> 00:08:25.179
My brother Northumberland.

164
00:08:26.288 --> 00:08:28.408
My boy. my boy!

165
00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:30.571
Father! How stands the day?

166
00:08:30.572 --> 00:08:32.678
My boy. the day is ours.

167
00:08:32.679 --> 00:08:34.928
While watching from my
horse I saw thee fight

168
00:08:34.929 --> 00:08:37.836
all glinting in the sun like mailèd Mars

169
00:08:37.837 --> 00:08:40.749
thy voice like thunder
shook the startled birds

170
00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:41.859
from every tree!

171
00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:43.119
The rabbits hereabout

172
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:45.609
did dive into their burrows as in fear

173
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.489
that they beheld a second Hercules!

174
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:50.469
A knight who rode beside me did exclaim

175
00:08:50.470 --> 00:08:53.559
the courage of. 'That warrior who strides

176
00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:56.139
into a battle like the foaming sea

177
00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:59.319
and parts it with defiant manly will!'

178
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:02.119
I with laughter

179
00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:05.060
proudly turned and cried to all

180
00:09:05.061 --> 00:09:06.549
'He is my son!'

181
00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.000
Thou hast brought
honour to our family name!

182
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:12.129
Enough! These gilded
garments fit me not.

183
00:09:12.130 --> 00:09:14.479
What of the Earl of Douglas? Where is he?

184
00:09:18.912 --> 00:09:20.612
Accursèd Scot!

185
00:09:20.613 --> 00:09:23.259
Thou villain! Thou base thing!

186
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.498
Good morrow. Harry Percy.

187
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:27.879
And my lord?

188
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.442
I am Sir Thomas Percy. Earl of Worcester

189
00:09:31.443 --> 00:09:33.661
the brother of the elder Henry here.

190
00:09:33.662 --> 00:09:34.969
Oooh.

191
00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.195
I see the landscape of Northumberland

192
00:09:37.196 --> 00:09:40.382
makes Percys grow like dandelions: weeds

193
00:09:40.383 --> 00:09:42.593
that are cut down and
then sprout up again.

194
00:09:42.594 --> 00:09:44.469
You cut my brother Ralph down.

195
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:49.470
Aye. I did. when you were
but a stripling. years ago.

196
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:54.220
And now I am your prisoner.

197
00:09:54.221 --> 00:09:56.079
Not for long.

198
00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:58.892
Father. lend me your sword.

199
00:09:58.893 --> 00:10:00.969
Send me to
meet my cousin Archibald

200
00:10:00.970 --> 00:10:03.849
who you dispatched today.
and we'll make hell

201
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:07.894
hold three prime places
for the Percy boys!

202
00:10:07.895 --> 00:10:11.778
Come. make it quick.

203
00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:16.333
Make way there! In Prince
Henry's name make way!

204
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:24.819
Which of you untaught knaves. unmannerly

205
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:27.849
to top the basest varlet. ranks enough

206
00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:30.159
among what out of London generously

207
00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.739
are flattered with the name of gentlemen

208
00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:34.929
to parlay with the issue of a King?

209
00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:39.309
These untaught knaves.
my prince. have won the day

210
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:42.184
and at a Kingly cost vanquished the Scot!

211
00:10:42.185 --> 00:10:43.359
Or were about to.

212
00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.369
Nay. put up that sword!

213
00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:46.719
Deliver any other prisoners

214
00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.599
that you may have without ransom or delay.

215
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.029
I shall escort them South with every speed

216
00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:54.309
to give them up unto my father's court.

217
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:55.779
It seems I am reprieved.

218
00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:57.759
Not him: he's mine.

219
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.409
Read you this letter that a messenger

220
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:03.168
placed in my hands just moments hence.

221
00:11:03.169 --> 00:11:06.818
The King. my father

222
00:11:07.661 --> 00:11:10.149
gave this urgent task to me

223
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:12.159
charging that I instruct Northumberland.

224
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.366
The Scots surrendered not unto the King

225
00:11:15.367 --> 00:11:18.702
but me! This is my field of victory!

226
00:11:18.703 --> 00:11:20.670
Can I surrender for a second time?

227
00:11:20.671 --> 00:11:22.251
I do accept.

228
00:11:22.252 --> 00:11:23.085
No!

229
00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.421
He has no command.

230
00:11:25.422 --> 00:11:27.861
I have command by this crown that I wear

231
00:11:27.862 --> 00:11:29.865
and by the blood I carry in my veins!

232
00:11:29.866 --> 00:11:32.199
You have no knights
on this field. no army

233
00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:34.839
you are no soldier. have
not stained your sword--

234
00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.919
I marched from London
to be here with you

235
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.269
to oversee your lumpen. awkward war

236
00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:46.839
braved villainous clouds
of salt-petre and soot

237
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.689
made blacker by egregious soldiers' oaths

238
00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.019
and pricking marshland
flies which steal my blood

239
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.039
by pints and gallons!

240
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:56.202
Not so. my precious prince

241
00:11:56.203 --> 00:11:59.739
you did not march here.
rather were you dragged

242
00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:03.249
with lumpen awkward feet and dainty hands

243
00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.159
sweet breath and neatly
polished fingernails

244
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.769
to sit in womanly idleness on your arse!

245
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.529
Then as the solider
here. you surely know

246
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.449
a soldier's duty is obedience!

247
00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:17.679
And my duty shall I discharge at once

248
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:18.909
in taking of your prisoners.

249
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:22.196
One word more and I shall
count you with my prisoners!

250
00:12:22.197 --> 00:12:25.209
This girlish tempest
temper quite exceeds

251
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:26.713
your savage reputation.

252
00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:29.743
- Girlish?
- Ay.

253
00:12:29.744 --> 00:12:31.376
Good nephew

254
00:12:31.377 --> 00:12:33.760
cool the fire of your rage!

255
00:12:33.761 --> 00:12:36.069
Have we not spoken many times of calm

256
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:37.989
and all the virtues that it brings a man?

257
00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:39.330
There is my gauge!

258
00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:41.709
Your hand would be advised

259
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.779
to sooner touch a venomous viper's tail

260
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:46.209
than such a certain
seal of vengeful death.

261
00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:49.059
- My prince. take up your
gauge: enough have died

262
00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.589
we need not have more bloodshed.

263
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.253
Come. let's talk.

264
00:12:52.254 --> 00:12:53.087
Come.

265
00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.253
Why 'girlish'? Wherefore
'girlish' sticks in me?

266
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:05.470
I am a man. no girl. that's certain!

267
00:13:05.471 --> 00:13:06.430
Raugh!

268
00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:07.779
This is fucking coconuts.

269
00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:09.053
Sh!

270
00:13:09.054 --> 00:13:11.649
Sit. Sit down. sit down.

271
00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:13.869
The orders from the King are genuine.

272
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:16.209
Specifically the Earl of Douglas' name

273
00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.099
is set down to be made a prisoner

274
00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.231
and not the instrument of our revenge.

275
00:13:21.232 --> 00:13:24.396
There's worse news in
the second letter here.

276
00:13:24.397 --> 00:13:26.638
Thy brother in law. that's Edmund Mortimer

277
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:29.319
against the irregular and wild Glendower

278
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.383
was by the rude hands of
that Welshman captured.

279
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.339
Alas. that we should weigh our victory

280
00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.519
in equal measure with such dark defeat

281
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.369
that celebration lights up all the North

282
00:13:42.370 --> 00:13:45.943
while funeral darkness
shades the sullen South.

283
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.389
Then both my brothers now are lost to me.

284
00:13:49.390 --> 00:13:51.669
Will neither be avenged?

285
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.113
Do not despair.

286
00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.579
Our Ralph is gone. but taking our revenge

287
00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.249
could never bid him walk out of his grave.

288
00:14:00.250 --> 00:14:02.623
I miss him every day.

289
00:14:03.970 --> 00:14:07.359
But I have found in time the
wound of grief becomes a scar

290
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.033
no longer bleeding but an old complaint.

291
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:14.889
I have one son still
breathing. and thy face

292
00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:17.232
alive and smiling is more dear to me

293
00:14:17.233 --> 00:14:21.134
than one more corpse left
out to feed the crows.

294
00:14:21.135 --> 00:14:24.039
And as for Edmund Mortimer. he lives!

295
00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.979
So as he lives we work to set him free.

296
00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:30.219
I council that we keep our prisoner here

297
00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.649
until King Henry is of such a mind

298
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:34.809
to ransom home our cousin who is lost.

299
00:14:34.810 --> 00:14:39.609
I am content. We
shall exchange the Scot.

300
00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:42.579
Unless you'd name Goliath as your second

301
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:45.249
the danger doth outweigh
your pride. my prince.

302
00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:47.259
You have yourself seen my nephew think not

303
00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.139
of gralloching a Scotsman in a stroke

304
00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.779
or mangling a Welshman so entire

305
00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:55.779
that Welsh alone has words savage enough

306
00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.819
to sound description in an English ear.

307
00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:01.059
I am familiar with your nephew's wrath.

308
00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:03.549
How deep the currents
of passion run in him.

309
00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:04.741
Your royal highness

310
00:15:04.742 --> 00:15:06.909
we propose a trade.

311
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:09.249
We will gladly give you
Douglas and the rest

312
00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:13.149
if your father the King can make a vow

313
00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:15.399
to ransom straight Edmund Mortimer

314
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.033
our cousin taken by the Welsh army.

315
00:15:18.034 --> 00:15:21.736
I cannot promise on the King's behalf.

316
00:15:21.737 --> 00:15:25.694
And yet I can on my own name. aye!

317
00:15:25.695 --> 00:15:27.069
Yes!

318
00:15:27.070 --> 00:15:30.879
This seems a friendly. even-handed suit.

319
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.204
I grant it. or I shall. yes. it is done!

320
00:15:35.205 --> 00:15:36.038
I like it!

321
00:15:36.039 --> 00:15:40.046
Silence. cur! Thou keep'st
thy head but temporarily.

322
00:15:40.047 --> 00:15:41.409
So do we all.

323
00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.839
Then I suggest we draw up the details

324
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.209
not in the frigid air but in my tent

325
00:15:46.210 --> 00:15:49.331
where we can all repose
and ease ourselves.

326
00:15:49.332 --> 00:15:52.479
Good nephew. we shall
parlay with the prince

327
00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.999
find you some other task or rest alone.

328
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.490
When we have reached a
compact we will call.

329
00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:01.149
Well fought today.

330
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:03.279
Our practise has borne fruit.

331
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.979
Thy swordsmanship is markedly improved.

332
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.453
I thank thee uncle.

333
00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:11.259
The wounded cry for aid;
I'll see them cared for

334
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:12.669
and retrieve my sword.

335
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.909
Make sure that Douglas
is kept under guard.

336
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:20.240
I'll rest me in the warm
tent for a spell.

337
00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:28.453
My Prince!

338
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.469
In careless passion and faint breath

339
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:35.739
from many miles of marching have you let

340
00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.373
your glove slip
negligently from your hand.

341
00:16:52.488 --> 00:16:55.929
I would we could be friends again. Harry.

342
00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:58.449
This long campaign has been a taxing road

343
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:01.560
too often paved with bitter
tears and loss and...

344
00:17:03.523 --> 00:17:07.339
And yet I am glad I came. for I met thee.

345
00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:21.561
Thou. soldier!

346
00:17:27.782 --> 00:17:30.825
Help me find my missing sword.

347
00:17:35.725 --> 00:17:39.279
When I pursued the Douglas as he fled

348
00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.429
I slipped into a bog and dropped my blade.

349
00:17:42.430 --> 00:17:44.919
I think it landed somewhere hereabout.

350
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.259
I'll search this way.
and thou the other. so

351
00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.089
we'll meet back in the middle.

352
00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:49.998
Verily!

353
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.129
So uh. we're looking for a missing sword?

354
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.596
Is it special? Or um...

355
00:17:58.597 --> 00:18:00.195
Generic sword-shaped?

356
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.685
What say'st thou? Hast
thou found the blasted thing?

357
00:18:03.686 --> 00:18:05.682
No. no. I'm still looking!

358
00:18:05.683 --> 00:18:08.034
Um. I would hate for you to
lose something like that.

359
00:18:08.035 --> 00:18:10.638
Probably got lots of
beheadings to do with it.

360
00:18:11.622 --> 00:18:14.443
My father gave it as a gift to me.

361
00:18:16.365 --> 00:18:19.389
It was to mark the day I came of age

362
00:18:19.390 --> 00:18:21.663
the day that I became...

363
00:18:22.587 --> 00:18:23.570
A man.

364
00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:32.635
I found it!

365
00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:43.081
There you go.

366
00:18:44.145 --> 00:18:48.100
I felt not quite myself without it here.

367
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:04.719
The old familiar heft.
the swing. the slice!

368
00:19:05.620 --> 00:19:07.899
I thank thee. soldier! I am much relieved.

369
00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.315
No worries. babe!

370
00:19:11.951 --> 00:19:14.491
Uh. I mean. um. I sayeth...

371
00:19:16.203 --> 00:19:19.868
Um. verily. there are...

372
00:19:19.869 --> 00:19:21.276
No worries. my lord.

373
00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.366
Where art thou from?

374
00:19:25.367 --> 00:19:28.873
Thou hast a strange... Dialect.

375
00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.009
I'm from Framlingham.

376
00:19:33.010 --> 00:19:36.069
But I'm staying down the road
with some friends. actually.

377
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:38.735
That's why I'm here on the battlefield.

378
00:19:39.945 --> 00:19:42.627
I just popped out to have a shufty

379
00:19:42.628 --> 00:19:44.829
and then you won. or we won

380
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:48.957
so. no worries.

381
00:19:51.013 --> 00:19:55.393
Wherever thou art from.
I thank thee. friend.

382
00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.867
Can I ask a question?

383
00:20:00.370 --> 00:20:02.136
Why do you talk like that?

384
00:20:03.559 --> 00:20:08.127
Um. each syllable and word considerèd

385
00:20:08.128 --> 00:20:11.949
all very grand. all
very much controlled. or

386
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:15.287
'thee' and 'thou' and so on and so forth?

387
00:20:15.288 --> 00:20:18.792
I speak but as I feel.

388
00:20:18.793 --> 00:20:23.589
My passions are all regimented.
so my thoughts. my words--

389
00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:24.550
Do you speak that way

390
00:20:24.551 --> 00:20:26.099
because it's genuinely how you think

391
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.367
or do you think that way

392
00:20:27.368 --> 00:20:29.444
because it was how you
were taught to speak?

393
00:20:33.932 --> 00:20:34.765
Um...

394
00:20:36.265 --> 00:20:40.230
I've always spoken this way: it is hard...

395
00:20:44.036 --> 00:20:45.735
It. it...

396
00:20:45.736 --> 00:20:49.341
It is hard to not do that.

397
00:20:54.728 --> 00:20:58.749
In Framlingham. they
do not speak like this

398
00:20:58.750 --> 00:21:02.023
but let their thoughts
spill out undisciplined?

399
00:21:03.430 --> 00:21:05.570
Yeah. I mean. I guess. yeah.

400
00:21:12.905 --> 00:21:15.797
I thank thee. soldier.
Go and get some rest.

401
00:21:15.798 --> 00:21:17.815
Well. it was nice to meet you.

402
00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.102
My husband. are you hurt?

403
00:21:35.103 --> 00:21:36.610
My..

404
00:21:36.611 --> 00:21:37.594
What a fall!

405
00:21:37.595 --> 00:21:38.741
I fell?

406
00:21:38.742 --> 00:21:41.023
I fear thou hit thy
head; come. let me see.

407
00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:43.352
There is no blood.

408
00:21:43.353 --> 00:21:45.069
Nay. do not try to stand

409
00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.183
but rest a moment.

410
00:21:47.560 --> 00:21:49.327
Let me see thy arm.

411
00:21:49.328 --> 00:21:54.009
Can'st bend it? Good.
it is not broken then.

412
00:21:54.010 --> 00:21:55.927
I'm not sure what just happened.

413
00:21:55.928 --> 00:21:58.089
Thou wert recounting the exciting tale

414
00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.559
of battling Douglas up at Holmedon Hill.

415
00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.219
Thou leapt up on the wall to demonstrate

416
00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:06.009
some action and thy
footing must have slipped!

417
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:09.430
When thou crashed down
at once in somersaults.

418
00:22:09.431 --> 00:22:10.779
Thou foolish thing.

419
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:11.789
We are most fortunate

420
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:13.899
thou did'st not land
upon thy sword. my love!

421
00:22:13.900 --> 00:22:15.461
My sword? This...

422
00:22:16.802 --> 00:22:18.934
This is my sword.

423
00:22:18.935 --> 00:22:22.699
And this. that I'm
wearing. this is my armour.

424
00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:25.873
All handsomely in mail you are arranged.

425
00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.969
Was there a woman here a second ago?

426
00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.159
I swear I was just chatting with someone.

427
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:36.040
I am the only woman here. my love.

428
00:22:39.862 --> 00:22:40.862
Of course.

429
00:22:41.969 --> 00:22:44.026
Of course

430
00:22:44.027 --> 00:22:45.718
my Kate.

431
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:51.870
I'll try to keep my feet on
firmer ground from now on

432
00:22:53.177 --> 00:22:55.299
Thou wert just telling
me of Edmund then?

433
00:22:55.300 --> 00:22:56.589
Yes. Edmund!

434
00:22:56.590 --> 00:22:58.719
We have asked the Prince of Wales

435
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.149
to intervene at court with his father

436
00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:03.759
persuading King Henry to ransom him.

437
00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.164
I know the Earl of Douglas vexes thee--

438
00:23:06.165 --> 00:23:09.464
Aye. some! Thou let him
stay in this. our home!

439
00:23:09.465 --> 00:23:11.859
It is a temporary lodging. love.

440
00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:14.229
With temporary longing shall I leave

441
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:16.719
thee soon to find a double remedy

442
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:21.399
for both thy woes: exchanging
our Edmund for that same Scot.

443
00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.632
Your horse is saddled

444
00:23:22.633 --> 00:23:24.024
and we stay for thee.

445
00:23:24.025 --> 00:23:25.029
Good morrow. Kate!

446
00:23:25.030 --> 00:23:26.709
Good morrow. noble father.

447
00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:29.780
I must away to London. Farewell. love.

448
00:23:35.052 --> 00:23:39.272
I thought there was another
woman here. How odd.

449
00:23:39.273 --> 00:23:41.079
I would be mad if e'er I wished

450
00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.909
to have another woman's company

451
00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:46.209
when thou art fairest of the fairer sex.

452
00:23:46.210 --> 00:23:50.469
Thy tongue produces
surfeit of sweet words.

453
00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:53.382
What other task then might I set it to?

454
00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:58.477
What still more pleasing
service might my tongue perform

455
00:23:58.478 --> 00:23:59.552
my Lady Kate?

456
00:23:59.553 --> 00:24:02.259
Thou naughty man!

457
00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:05.889
My innocent ears shall
not hear such things. sir!

458
00:24:05.890 --> 00:24:09.969
Thy wit is like the
sunshine: though it warms

459
00:24:09.970 --> 00:24:13.569
in tarrying in't I fear I shall turn pink!

460
00:24:13.570 --> 00:24:17.079
A pretty jest! Thy lips have talent too.

461
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:20.199
Would my tongue and thy
lips worked hand in hand

462
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.604
what splendid poetry they
might devise.

463
00:24:23.605 --> 00:24:27.131
Thy lips and thy tongue. sayest thou?

464
00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:29.331
And what else?

465
00:24:30.430 --> 00:24:32.344
It is a
pity I must ride away.

466
00:24:34.030 --> 00:24:36.973
I'd rather I than thy horse under thee!

467
00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:42.309
Peace. love! Wouldst lay
me down on muddy grass?

468
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.492
The grass would be the
luckiest in the world

469
00:24:44.493 --> 00:24:47.049
if thou wouldst only be on top of it!

470
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:50.949
But I could spare thee
from the mud and lie

471
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:54.841
between thee and the
grass. if thou did wish!

472
00:25:00.109 --> 00:25:01.793
Then go thou with my love.

473
00:25:03.458 --> 00:25:05.439
I loathe these days!

474
00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.509
Too frequent and too hastily announced

475
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:11.229
when we must part. thou out into the world

476
00:25:11.230 --> 00:25:13.990
and I for Alnwick Castle's lonely spires.

477
00:25:13.991 --> 00:25:14.950
It is my duty.

478
00:25:14.951 --> 00:25:18.309
- Am I thy duty?
- Aye.

479
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:22.149
My joy. The better half of all my life.

480
00:25:22.150 --> 00:25:25.709
What would a husband be without his wife?

481
00:25:29.406 --> 00:25:30.761
It's okay. Poor sausage.

482
00:25:30.762 --> 00:25:31.595
Come here.

483
00:25:31.596 --> 00:25:33.497
My whole arm's got pins and needles.

484
00:25:33.498 --> 00:25:35.079
That's all right. don't
you worry. Sammy's here.

485
00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.313
Wiggle your fingers for me.

486
00:25:37.362 --> 00:25:39.014
Yeah. I don't think
anything's too badly broken--

487
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.969
It felt like sticking a
fork in a plug socket!

488
00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:44.017
Silly old sausage.

489
00:25:44.018 --> 00:25:45.659
No.

490
00:25:45.660 --> 00:25:47.229
What is going on here?

491
00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:49.893
All right.

492
00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.730
This might be a lot to
process. my lovely. but...

493
00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:57.703
You are inside a play.

494
00:25:59.327 --> 00:26:00.578
What the fuck?

495
00:26:01.469 --> 00:26:05.949
Actually a whole dimension
of plays. a whole multiverse!

496
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.658
I don't know whether we're
lying in a coma up there

497
00:26:07.659 --> 00:26:09.039
or if we're sharing the same dream.

498
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:10.629
Last thing I remember from the real world

499
00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:13.125
I was dropping off to sleep
in the back of my car.

500
00:26:14.184 --> 00:26:16.499
Well. next thing I knew

501
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.759
I was Cleopatra

502
00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.212
ruling over Ancient Egypt.

503
00:26:21.213 --> 00:26:22.820
Which had its perks

504
00:26:23.763 --> 00:26:24.857
but it all seemed a bit weird.

505
00:26:24.858 --> 00:26:27.298
So I looked inside my bag

506
00:26:27.299 --> 00:26:28.981
which I still had with me.

507
00:26:28.982 --> 00:26:30.506
I saw the Diet Coke bottle and I thought

508
00:26:31.341 --> 00:26:34.104
that's funny. they don't have
Diet Coke in Ancient Egypt.

509
00:26:35.021 --> 00:26:35.854
And that's when it hit me.

510
00:26:35.855 --> 00:26:38.199
It wasn't just Ancient Egypt.

511
00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:41.460
This was Antony and Cleopatra.

512
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:46.717
As in the play "Antony and Cleopatra."

513
00:26:49.892 --> 00:26:52.119
As in Shakespeare!

514
00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:55.163
Oh. no! Bloody hell. I hate Shakespeare.

515
00:26:55.164 --> 00:26:57.909
Well. I did a runner. I
wound up in "The Tempest"

516
00:26:57.910 --> 00:27:00.699
then "A Midsummer Night's
Dream" and a bunch more.

517
00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:01.982
Went through all the Roman ones

518
00:27:01.983 --> 00:27:04.253
saw you in "Julius Caesar"
and my first thought was

519
00:27:04.254 --> 00:27:07.539
'Gosh. I've got to get her
out of here because she's...

520
00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:09.272
You know...

521
00:27:09.273 --> 00:27:10.264
Like me.'

522
00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.834
Well. actually my first thought was

523
00:27:12.835 --> 00:27:14.208
'Gosh. isn't she gorgeous!'

524
00:27:14.209 --> 00:27:15.969
I imagined you had a
very glamorous lifestyle

525
00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:17.619
somewhere with uh. lots of friends

526
00:27:17.620 --> 00:27:19.059
and a gazillion Instagram followers

527
00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:19.893
who'd all be missing you!

528
00:27:19.894 --> 00:27:21.279
I'm nattering. sorry.

529
00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.404
No. that's all right

530
00:27:22.405 --> 00:27:25.569
at least I can understand
what you're saying.

531
00:27:25.570 --> 00:27:28.029
We're inside Shakespeare?

532
00:27:28.030 --> 00:27:28.863
Yeah.

533
00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:31.155
The play. not the man.

534
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.495
Right. I'm calling 999.

535
00:27:41.153 --> 00:27:41.986
It's dead?

536
00:27:41.987 --> 00:27:43.421
Do you have a charger?

537
00:27:45.656 --> 00:27:47.039
I've got something better.

538
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:02.469
Ta-dah!

539
00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:04.509
I picked this up when I
was down in "The Tempest."

540
00:28:04.510 --> 00:28:06.842
Nicked it right out from
under old Prospero's nose.

541
00:28:06.843 --> 00:28:09.549
It's got everything on it.
it's like magical Google.

542
00:28:09.550 --> 00:28:10.899
What is it?

543
00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:12.159
A map.

544
00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:14.149
Although I did steal it
from a wizard. darling.

545
00:28:14.150 --> 00:28:16.210
It's not exactly Ordnance Survey.

546
00:28:22.988 --> 00:28:24.218
Whoa...

547
00:28:24.219 --> 00:28:26.443
Mhm! Trippy.

548
00:28:26.444 --> 00:28:27.999
All the different plays--

549
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.573
all separated into
their own little worlds.

550
00:28:35.685 --> 00:28:38.215
They have their
exits and their entrances--

551
00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:45.630
Yet who would
have thought the old man

552
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:48.201
to have had so much blood in him?

553
00:28:50.536 --> 00:28:51.369
Sorry.

554
00:28:51.369 --> 00:28:52.202
I'll help you.

555
00:28:52.203 --> 00:28:54.890
And these. these are the
doorways between them.

556
00:28:54.891 --> 00:28:56.929
All you have to do is
be in the right place

557
00:28:56.930 --> 00:29:01.100
at the right time and
you can jump through.

558
00:29:07.895 --> 00:29:09.279
So um. what play are we in?

559
00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.582
Well. that's the good news.

560
00:29:10.583 --> 00:29:13.581
We are right at the beginning
of "Henry IV" Part One.

561
00:29:13.582 --> 00:29:15.039
I've been trying to get here for ages.

562
00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.409
Look at this. this big
doorway right at the top.

563
00:29:17.410 --> 00:29:18.849
Read that. what does that say?

564
00:29:18.850 --> 00:29:20.469
'Out.'

565
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:23.649
The doorways always
appear at moments of choice

566
00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:25.767
forks in the road. and
at the end of this play

567
00:29:25.768 --> 00:29:27.459
there's a great big one.

568
00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:29.845
Prince Hal starts off a mess

569
00:29:29.846 --> 00:29:31.749
but he puts aside his wayward youth.

570
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:34.209
He has to choose between his old life

571
00:29:34.210 --> 00:29:35.750
and the role he was born to play

572
00:29:35.751 --> 00:29:36.589
so!

573
00:29:36.590 --> 00:29:39.609
If we can follow him. lurk in
the background of his scenes

574
00:29:39.610 --> 00:29:41.949
stick to him like glue. then
eventually we'll come across

575
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:45.824
that great big beautiful
doorway and that. that Jen

576
00:29:45.825 --> 00:29:46.658
is 'Out!'

577
00:29:47.491 --> 00:29:48.453
Can't believe it.

578
00:29:48.454 --> 00:29:50.199
Hey. maybe we wanna
ask some of the people

579
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.789
who are already down here about it?

580
00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.126
I spoke to that girl. the
one who lost her sword

581
00:29:54.127 --> 00:29:55.424
and she seems like she would help--

582
00:29:58.090 --> 00:29:58.923
No.

583
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.103
They're antibodies. Um. characters.

584
00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.279
Down here is their home

585
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.333
and they like it just the way it is.

586
00:30:08.334 --> 00:30:09.837
Can they hurt us?

587
00:30:09.838 --> 00:30:11.864
They can do much worse than that.

588
00:30:11.865 --> 00:30:14.739
If they sucked you into playing
a role in their story again

589
00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:17.240
then you might be stuck down here forever.

590
00:30:18.130 --> 00:30:19.299
That's why I'd appreciate it

591
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:20.895
if you were a bit more ears open

592
00:30:20.896 --> 00:30:23.119
when I'm giving you
instructions. all right?

593
00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.549
Wouldn't want you getting hurt again.

594
00:30:24.550 --> 00:30:25.959
Sorry.

595
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.186
But for future reference.
if they speak to me

596
00:30:28.187 --> 00:30:29.294
what am I supposed to do?

597
00:30:29.295 --> 00:30:32.147
Well. if you have to
improvise. don't break rhythm.

598
00:30:32.148 --> 00:30:34.422
If they give you six beats. for example

599
00:30:34.423 --> 00:30:36.405
give them four back. So um...

600
00:30:43.107 --> 00:30:45.251
Well. anyway. it always adds up to ten.

601
00:30:45.252 --> 00:30:47.559
And as long as you're in rhythm

602
00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.670
they see what they want to see.

603
00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:54.970
It's changing!

604
00:30:56.970 --> 00:30:58.335
Move. Move.

605
00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:04.929
Those prisoners in your
highness' name demanded

606
00:31:04.930 --> 00:31:08.199
which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took

607
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:11.829
were. as he says. not
with such strength denied

608
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:13.669
as is deliver'd to your majesty!

609
00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:16.179
Either envy. therefore. or misprison

610
00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.909
is guilty of this fault. not him. my King.

611
00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.545
My liege. I did deny no prisoners--

612
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:27.759
How like a comet comes
the Prince of Wales

613
00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:31.719
amazing all and yet so seldom seen

614
00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:34.869
that all our wisest sagest astronomers

615
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:37.959
can ne'er predict his visits to the court.

616
00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:40.419
Good gentlemen. I beg your patience

617
00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.604
I was detained upon an urgent...

618
00:31:43.886 --> 00:31:44.719
Thing.

619
00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:49.689
My liege. I did deny no prisoners

620
00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:51.939
but I remember. when the fight was done

621
00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:56.439
when I was dry with rage and extreme toil

622
00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.919
breathless and faint.
leaning upon my sword

623
00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:03.501
came there. a certain lord

624
00:32:03.502 --> 00:32:05.586
neat. and trimly dress'd

625
00:32:05.587 --> 00:32:09.085
fresh as a bridegroom;
and his chin new reap'd

626
00:32:09.086 --> 00:32:11.664
show'd like a stubble-land
at harvest-home.

627
00:32:11.665 --> 00:32:16.183
And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by

628
00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.819
he call'd them untaught
knaves. unmannerly!

629
00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:24.699
With many holiday and lady terms

630
00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.879
he question'd me; amongst
the rest. demanded

631
00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.279
my prisoners in your majesty's behalf.

632
00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:35.279
I then. all smarting
with my wounds being cold

633
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.230
out of my grief and my impatience

634
00:32:39.231 --> 00:32:42.286
answer'd neglectingly I know not what

635
00:32:42.287 --> 00:32:45.519
he should or he should
not; for he made me mad

636
00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:50.319
to see him shine so
brisk and smell so sweet

637
00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:52.839
and talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman

638
00:32:52.840 --> 00:32:56.704
of guns and drums and wounds

639
00:32:56.705 --> 00:32:58.153
God save the mark!

640
00:32:59.890 --> 00:33:02.529
This bald unjointed chat of his. my lord

641
00:33:02.530 --> 00:33:05.199
was answer'd indirectly. as I said.

642
00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.743
This lord who so
provoked your heated words

643
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:12.858
what was his name?

644
00:33:23.163 --> 00:33:25.663
I cannot recall. my liege.

645
00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:35.651
Um...

646
00:33:36.485 --> 00:33:37.401
The circumstance--

647
00:33:37.402 --> 00:33:39.899
The circumstance
consider'd. good my lord

648
00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.424
whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said

649
00:33:42.425 --> 00:33:44.889
may reasonably die and never rise

650
00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:47.559
to do him wrong or any way impeach

651
00:33:47.560 --> 00:33:50.600
what he had said. so he unsay it now.

652
00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.480
Well said. my noble knight.

653
00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:56.859
Why. yet he doth deny his prisoners

654
00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.575
but with proviso and exception

655
00:33:58.576 --> 00:34:02.319
that we at our own
charge shall ransom home

656
00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:05.319
his brother-in-law. the foolish Mortimer

657
00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:08.169
who. on my soul. hath wilfully betray'd

658
00:34:08.170 --> 00:34:10.689
the lives of those that
he did lead to fight

659
00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:14.082
against that great
magician. damn'd Glendower.

660
00:34:14.083 --> 00:34:19.083
Shall we buy treason and indent with fears

661
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:21.698
when they have lost and
forfeited themselves?

662
00:34:21.699 --> 00:34:22.533
No--

663
00:34:24.416 --> 00:34:27.781
on the barren mountains let him starve

664
00:34:27.782 --> 00:34:29.979
for I shall never hold that man my friend

665
00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:33.759
whose tongue shall ask
me for one penny cost

666
00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.369
to ransom home revolted Mortimer.

667
00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:38.408
Revolted Mortimer!

668
00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:41.049
He never did fall off. my sovereign liege

669
00:34:41.050 --> 00:34:42.579
but by the chance of war!

670
00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:47.580
Thou dost belie him.
Percy. thou dost belie him.

671
00:34:49.117 --> 00:34:50.922
Art thou not ashamed?

672
00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:52.899
But. sirrah. henceforth

673
00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:55.388
let me not hear thee speak of Mortimer.

674
00:34:55.389 --> 00:34:57.789
Bring me your Douglas
with the speediest means

675
00:34:57.790 --> 00:35:00.219
or you shall hear from me in such a kind

676
00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:02.919
as will displease you.

677
00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.760
Look to it at once!

678
00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:15.879
I thank thee that thou chose to overlook

679
00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.502
my name when thou
recounted Holmedon's fray.

680
00:35:18.503 --> 00:35:20.499
I must express my earnest gratitude--

681
00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:22.779
Your gratitude is worth nothing to me

682
00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.910
whilst Mortimer my brother lies in chains

683
00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:30.789
and we men of the North who won that crown

684
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:34.389
that your father so
proudly wears are dogged

685
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:37.029
at every turn by his misgovernance!

686
00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:41.562
Let not his wrathful
mood affright your heart.

687
00:35:41.563 --> 00:35:43.753
I am the cause of his distemperment.

688
00:35:44.740 --> 00:35:47.330
He sees that I am yet to take a wife

689
00:35:48.420 --> 00:35:52.353
and worries I am not...

690
00:35:53.603 --> 00:35:55.119
The marriage type.

691
00:35:56.453 --> 00:35:59.349
He loves thee well. and heartily desires

692
00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:02.635
that I reform myself to be like thee.

693
00:36:02.636 --> 00:36:06.369
Therefore. if it should
please thee. stay at court

694
00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:09.159
and join me in a hunt. or
else at dice. or tennis.

695
00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:12.069
Therein serve a double aim.

696
00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:14.379
Convince my father that I spend my time

697
00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.899
in company of which he doth approve

698
00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:20.199
and by that feint we calm his stormy mood

699
00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:22.719
thy suit for Mortimer may yet succeed!

700
00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.019
And secondly we serve our private aim.

701
00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:28.231
Which is. if I have
read thy heart correct--

702
00:36:28.232 --> 00:36:31.209
Is this the business
that the Prince of Wales

703
00:36:31.210 --> 00:36:34.179
finds suits his majesty. eh?

704
00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.613
Tennis? Dice?

705
00:36:37.662 --> 00:36:39.449
Are't so effeminate?

706
00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:43.269
Are't so attuned to that
degenerate company you keep?

707
00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:46.569
Whose prince is this.
who minces and who chats

708
00:36:46.570 --> 00:36:48.879
more like a Princess than a royal heir?

709
00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:51.489
I know you love your brother Mortimer

710
00:36:51.490 --> 00:36:54.159
and for that love. and
that which I bear you

711
00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:57.249
I shall attempt to calm my father's storm.

712
00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:01.569
Meantime. my lords. obedience is due.

713
00:37:01.570 --> 00:37:03.549
Send us your prisoners.
or you will hear of it.

714
00:37:03.550 --> 00:37:05.502
An' if the devil come and roar for them

715
00:37:05.503 --> 00:37:08.589
I will not send them: I will
after straight and tell him so

716
00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:11.859
for I will ease my heart. albeit
I make a hazard of my head!

717
00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:16.329
- What. drunk with choler?
- Stay and pause awhile.

718
00:37:16.330 --> 00:37:19.513
Remember calm. remember reason. think!

719
00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.079
Soldier!

720
00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:25.359
The old Earl of Northumberland

721
00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:28.059
is waiting just outside; he was dismissed

722
00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:30.459
in rage by King Henry.

723
00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.472
Go fetch him in.

724
00:37:31.473 --> 00:37:33.755
We shall obey at once. my lord Hotspur.

725
00:37:35.936 --> 00:37:37.283
Wait.

726
00:37:39.225 --> 00:37:41.019
Have we met?

727
00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:43.599
Yes. quite possibly. perhaps

728
00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:45.716
your lordship might have
seen us here before.

729
00:37:45.717 --> 00:37:48.502
We have been guarding
this palace for years.

730
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.783
What is thy name. soldier?

731
00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.591
Why. Jen. my lord.

732
00:37:58.630 --> 00:38:00.277
Come. shake my hand.

733
00:38:01.169 --> 00:38:04.839
Thy hand. my lord? What for?

734
00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:09.280
In friendship or in enmity. choose one

735
00:38:09.281 --> 00:38:11.476
I care not. simply do as thou art told.

736
00:38:11.477 --> 00:38:12.310
Give me thy hand.

737
00:38:12.311 --> 00:38:13.993
Okay. Yeah.

738
00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:16.825
Here it is.

739
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:29.970
I thank thee.

740
00:38:31.180 --> 00:38:32.604
No problem-o.

741
00:38:33.955 --> 00:38:35.439
We'll fetch him

742
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:39.879
the man thou did request to see just now.

743
00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.871
In fact I see him coming
already. so

744
00:38:44.872 --> 00:38:48.227
we'll see thee later. alligator...

745
00:38:51.291 --> 00:38:52.124
Or!

746
00:38:53.682 --> 00:38:56.709
Brother. the King hath forcibly denied

747
00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:58.629
our pleas to ransom Edmund Mortimer!

748
00:38:58.630 --> 00:39:01.209
What's happened? What
was said when I was gone?

749
00:39:01.210 --> 00:39:04.350
He will forsooth have all our prisoners

750
00:39:04.351 --> 00:39:05.184
and when I--

751
00:39:09.667 --> 00:39:12.309
And when we urged the ransom once again

752
00:39:12.310 --> 00:39:16.146
of our dear cousin. then
his cheek look'd pale

753
00:39:16.147 --> 00:39:18.339
and on my face he turn'd an eye of death

754
00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.953
trembling even at the name of Mortimer!

755
00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:28.123
Is King Henry not my father's very twin?

756
00:39:30.940 --> 00:39:32.765
How is't I never noticed it before?

757
00:39:34.552 --> 00:39:39.526
They are as like as this hand to itself!

758
00:39:41.946 --> 00:39:45.609
What. is God's highest so common in form

759
00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:48.681
that Kings are found in twos?

760
00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.029
And all alone.

761
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:57.019
Save for those guards. that
Jen. whose face I think

762
00:39:57.020 --> 00:40:00.136
I have encountered once before somewhere.

763
00:40:02.144 --> 00:40:03.374
And Henry

764
00:40:03.375 --> 00:40:05.450
Prince of Wales. that libertine

765
00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:13.093
where was King Henry's retinue. his queen

766
00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.028
his knights. his courtiers

767
00:40:18.636 --> 00:40:20.169
or his people...

768
00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.274
Shouldn't there be. like. more people here

769
00:40:26.109 --> 00:40:27.157
or something?

770
00:40:35.266 --> 00:40:37.056
Who the fuck are you?

771
00:40:38.115 --> 00:40:40.779
Good nephew. give me audience a while!

772
00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:41.613
And now

773
00:40:41.614 --> 00:40:44.529
I will unclasp a secret book

774
00:40:44.530 --> 00:40:48.149
and to your bluh bluh-bluh-bluh bluh-bluh

775
00:40:48.150 --> 00:40:52.465
Bluh bluh bluh bluh-bluh
bluh bluh bluh-bluh-bluh

776
00:40:52.466 --> 00:40:55.648
bluh bluh bluh bluh-bluh
bluh bluh-bluh-bluh bluh.

777
00:40:55.649 --> 00:41:00.574
Bluh bluh bluh-bluh-bluh
bluh-bluh bluh bluh bluh.

778
00:41:02.865 --> 00:41:04.138
Sorry. what did you just say?

779
00:41:05.164 --> 00:41:07.721
De dum. de dum. de dum. the King de dum

780
00:41:08.557 --> 00:41:11.135
de-dum de-dum de-dum de-dum the crown?

781
00:41:11.136 --> 00:41:13.131
Bluh bluh. Bluh-bluh bluh bluh bluh.

782
00:41:13.132 --> 00:41:15.073
De dum de dum-de dum de dum-de King.

783
00:41:15.074 --> 00:41:16.960
De dum de dum de dum-de dum-de dum!

784
00:41:16.961 --> 00:41:19.479
Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh
bluh-bluh bluh-bluh-bluh.

785
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.377
Wait. wait.

786
00:41:24.135 --> 00:41:25.213
Look at this place.

787
00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.291
Look at them. who are they?

788
00:41:29.292 --> 00:41:31.686
Bluh bluh bluh bluh bluh-bluh-bluh!

789
00:41:31.687 --> 00:41:32.769
De-dum de-dum de-dum--

790
00:41:32.770 --> 00:41:34.419
my son be so employed.

791
00:41:35.362 --> 00:41:37.509
Rebellion is our aim. we shall seek out

792
00:41:37.510 --> 00:41:39.819
a head of safety with
the Archbishop of York

793
00:41:39.820 --> 00:41:41.589
and Douglas. and Glendower

794
00:41:41.590 --> 00:41:46.590
and Mortimer. to. to
overthrow the... King.

795
00:41:46.690 --> 00:41:50.109
- My lords.
farewell: no further go in this

796
00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:52.599
than I by letters shall
direct your course.

797
00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.629
Farewell. good brother:
we shall thrive. I trust.

798
00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:57.062
Brother. Adieu.

799
00:41:57.063 --> 00:41:59.079
O. let the hours be short

800
00:41:59.080 --> 00:42:03.680
till fields and blows and
groans applaud our sport!

801
00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:11.017
There they are. Mhm. mhm. mhm.

802
00:42:11.018 --> 00:42:13.650
Aah... There he is. get down!

803
00:42:20.209 --> 00:42:21.580
Good! We're right on track.

804
00:42:21.581 --> 00:42:22.899
We'll be out of here in no time!

805
00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:24.519
I think I'm getting
the hang of this place.

806
00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:26.372
Did you see that bit of improv back there?

807
00:42:26.373 --> 00:42:30.332
Serving ten syllables every time. buh-bam!

808
00:42:30.333 --> 00:42:32.365
Except for when you
called Hotspur 'thou'

809
00:42:32.366 --> 00:42:33.564
instead of 'you!'

810
00:42:33.565 --> 00:42:34.956
In Shakespeare

811
00:42:34.957 --> 00:42:37.448
calling someone 'you' implies respect.

812
00:42:37.449 --> 00:42:40.856
Calling someone 'thou' implies
familiarity and intimacy.

813
00:42:40.857 --> 00:42:42.699
Are you having a laugh?

814
00:42:42.700 --> 00:42:43.749
What?

815
00:42:43.750 --> 00:42:45.369
Are you telling me
that every two minutes

816
00:42:45.370 --> 00:42:47.696
these fucking cis people
change their pronouns?

817
00:42:50.474 --> 00:42:53.394
I can see why people like this stuff.

818
00:42:53.395 --> 00:42:57.129
Oh. and those two-- the prince
and Hotspur. so adorable

819
00:42:57.130 --> 00:43:00.623
like super tragic but. argh!
So much drama. I love it!

820
00:43:02.349 --> 00:43:03.816
Does it have a happy ending?

821
00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.179
Well. it doesn't matter. my love

822
00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.559
as long as we find that doorway out.

823
00:43:08.560 --> 00:43:10.539
Right. but does it have
a happy ending though--

824
00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.626
Well. let's stay in the now. shall we?

825
00:43:12.627 --> 00:43:13.460
If Prince Hal--

826
00:43:13.461 --> 00:43:14.619
No. excuse me. if we're about

827
00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.179
where I think we--

828
00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:18.045
Prince Hal is about to have
a massive row with his Dad.

829
00:43:18.046 --> 00:43:18.879
What?

830
00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:20.003
Yes. sit down.

831
00:43:20.004 --> 00:43:20.837
My lords

832
00:43:20.838 --> 00:43:23.409
give us leave awhile.
The Prince of Wales and I

833
00:43:23.410 --> 00:43:25.988
must have some private conference.

834
00:43:25.989 --> 00:43:28.881
Be near at hand. for we shall
presently have need of you.

835
00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:33.189
Yet wait. my sovereign king!

836
00:43:33.190 --> 00:43:38.190
Let us not go just yet. for we
can be of some use to thee...

837
00:43:38.634 --> 00:43:40.285
You. to you!

838
00:43:40.286 --> 00:43:41.119
Um

839
00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:43.257
don't argue with your son. he is a nice

840
00:43:43.258 --> 00:43:45.579
boy and we have heard
good things about him

841
00:43:45.580 --> 00:43:47.603
that you will want to know. such as. um--

842
00:43:47.604 --> 00:43:48.797
What are you doing?

843
00:43:48.798 --> 00:43:49.675
I'm trying to help!

844
00:43:49.676 --> 00:43:50.728
Hey. look at this!

845
00:43:50.729 --> 00:43:53.319
I know you'd spare me
from my father's words

846
00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:56.259
and I am grateful for your efforts. friend

847
00:43:56.260 --> 00:43:58.839
but they shall only spur his anger on.

848
00:43:58.840 --> 00:43:59.893
Do as he says.

849
00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:03.369
I can withstand his rage.

850
00:44:03.370 --> 00:44:04.869
Are you sure?

851
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:07.320
Like this is super fucked
up. What's his problem?

852
00:44:08.350 --> 00:44:10.123
You're gay. so what?

853
00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:13.927
Or 'not the marriage type'?

854
00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.058
That's what this is about. right?

855
00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:20.241
Hey. so what?

856
00:44:20.242 --> 00:44:21.678
It's okay.

857
00:44:25.505 --> 00:44:28.693
The Prince of Wales
is all that I can be.

858
00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:32.499
Yet I appreciate thy honest tongue.

859
00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:35.100
Would honesty were all my role demanded.

860
00:44:48.964 --> 00:44:51.609
We are accustomed. when we give commands

861
00:44:51.610 --> 00:44:53.829
to having them obeyed. and promptly!

862
00:44:53.830 --> 00:44:57.818
Go! Be there at the
entrances. let none come in!

863
00:45:05.927 --> 00:45:09.819
I know not whether God will have it so

864
00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:13.269
for some displeasing service I have done

865
00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:17.889
that. in his secret doom. out of my blood

866
00:45:17.890 --> 00:45:21.369
he'll breed revengement
and a scourge for me.

867
00:45:21.370 --> 00:45:23.859
But thou dost in thy passages of life

868
00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:26.109
make me believe that thou art only mark'd

869
00:45:26.110 --> 00:45:28.419
for the hot vengeance
and the rod of heaven

870
00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:32.044
to punish my mistreadings. Tell me else

871
00:45:32.045 --> 00:45:35.019
could such inordinate and low desires

872
00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.079
such barren pleasures. rude society

873
00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:40.659
as thou art matched
withal and grafted to--

874
00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:42.669
So please. your majesty. I would I could

875
00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:44.829
quit all offences with as clear excuse--

876
00:45:44.830 --> 00:45:47.619
The hope and expectation of thy time

877
00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:51.549
is ruin'd. and the soul of every man

878
00:45:51.550 --> 00:45:54.094
prophetically doth forethink thy fall.

879
00:45:54.095 --> 00:45:56.302
Do not think so; you
shall not find it so.

880
00:45:56.303 --> 00:45:59.259
It has been found;
why shall I not believe

881
00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:01.744
that which is proved?
Or canst thou summon up

882
00:46:01.745 --> 00:46:03.857
some words to excuse thy vulgar choice

883
00:46:03.858 --> 00:46:06.789
to live so far from all propriety?

884
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:07.893
What say'st thou?

885
00:46:07.894 --> 00:46:08.789
- My lord--
- How canst thou

886
00:46:08.789 --> 00:46:09.622
account for this?

887
00:46:09.623 --> 00:46:14.439
Why dost thou set thy will so
far from wisdom and prudence?

888
00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:15.586
Why dost thou?

889
00:46:15.587 --> 00:46:18.399
Indulging thy desires. deepening them

890
00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.559
not reigning thyself
in. as princes should?

891
00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.199
I shall hereafter.
my thrice gracious lord

892
00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:25.659
- be more myself!
- Thyself!

893
00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:29.079
Hotspur hath more loyalty. more
worthy interest to the state

894
00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:31.569
than thou the shadow of succession.

895
00:46:31.570 --> 00:46:34.543
But wherefore do I tell
these news to thee?

896
00:46:35.530 --> 00:46:39.459
Why. Harry. do I tell thee of my foes

897
00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:42.493
which art my near'st and dearest enemy?

898
00:46:44.530 --> 00:46:48.912
To squander years of true

899
00:46:48.913 --> 00:46:50.589
paternal love

900
00:46:50.590 --> 00:46:52.965
to show how much thou art...

901
00:46:55.381 --> 00:46:56.639
Degenerate!

902
00:47:01.396 --> 00:47:03.999
Yeah. Cool.

903
00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.069
Sick. Cheers. Dad!

904
00:47:06.070 --> 00:47:10.179
Hotspur's a legend actually.
Just completely fair play!

905
00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:14.654
He's like. 'I killed a dozen
Scottish people today. huh-hah!

906
00:47:17.147 --> 00:47:18.339
Huh-hah! Legend!

907
00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:19.999
I have a sexy wife!

908
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.997
She's like. 'Oh Harry. how
many hast thou killed today?'

909
00:47:24.998 --> 00:47:27.869
and I'm like. 'Feed my horse. bitch!'

910
00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:31.989
Grr! Oh.
I must have my prisoners!

911
00:47:31.990 --> 00:47:34.659
I must have Mortimer back King Henry--

912
00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.334
I'm a very serious person!

913
00:47:36.335 --> 00:47:38.734
Yes. Harry Hotspur

914
00:47:38.735 --> 00:47:40.974
I take you very seriously!

915
00:47:40.975 --> 00:47:44.284
This is the most dynamite
shit I have ever seen!

916
00:47:45.158 --> 00:47:49.666
Oh and by the way. congratulations
on your very sexy wife!

917
00:47:49.667 --> 00:47:50.699
Thank you!

918
00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.865
I won her in a fight I had with a wolf.

919
00:47:54.616 --> 00:47:56.842
A wife worthy of a Prince!

920
00:47:56.843 --> 00:47:59.405
Oh. how I wish you were my son

921
00:47:59.406 --> 00:48:01.629
and then I would have
a sexy daughter-in-law!

922
00:48:01.630 --> 00:48:05.229
I wish my son would obtain a sexy wife.

923
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:08.019
He seems to spend all of his time with men

924
00:48:08.020 --> 00:48:12.998
for reasons that are somehow
still a mystery to me!

925
00:48:14.910 --> 00:48:16.659
Oh King Henry

926
00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:18.658
your son is a nancy boy!

927
00:48:18.659 --> 00:48:22.209
He has clean fingernails
and he combs his hair

928
00:48:22.210 --> 00:48:24.789
and he does not have a very sexy wife!

929
00:48:24.790 --> 00:48:27.597
He knows nothing of the pussy!

930
00:48:27.598 --> 00:48:30.176
He is unquestionably a faggot

931
00:48:30.177 --> 00:48:32.229
of the most heinous disposition!

932
00:48:32.230 --> 00:48:34.396
Take me as your son instead!

933
00:48:34.397 --> 00:48:35.662
Yes!

934
00:48:35.663 --> 00:48:37.554
That is absolutely a sensible reaction

935
00:48:37.555 --> 00:48:39.429
to my son's homosexuality

936
00:48:39.430 --> 00:48:42.989
and not at all likely
to scar him for life.

937
00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:45.999
Cheers Dad! Yeah. yeah!

938
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:46.903
Nice one!

939
00:48:57.723 --> 00:48:58.855
I'm sorry.

940
00:49:00.072 --> 00:49:02.458
Sorry's not good enough.
to be frank with you.

941
00:49:02.459 --> 00:49:04.549
We might really
be in the shit here now

942
00:49:04.550 --> 00:49:05.383
come on!

943
00:49:17.799 --> 00:49:18.632
Sam?

944
00:49:22.808 --> 00:49:25.475
Oh shit. Jen. You've porked it now. babes.

945
00:49:27.008 --> 00:49:28.319
Um...

946
00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:31.904
Okay. a magic map. A magic map.

947
00:49:31.905 --> 00:49:33.171
Um. easy.

948
00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:39.609
- Northumberland--
- Northumberland...

949
00:49:39.610 --> 00:49:41.742
- Alnwick Castle--
- Alnwick Castle?

950
00:49:41.743 --> 00:49:42.892
Several Weeks Later.

951
00:49:42.893 --> 00:49:44.375
Several Weeks Later.

952
00:49:44.376 --> 00:49:46.783
My gracious host!

953
00:49:46.784 --> 00:49:48.707
I must express my thanks.

954
00:49:48.708 --> 00:49:51.453
Your hospitality has been so mild

955
00:49:53.663 --> 00:49:56.631
Your castle has been
such a welcoming respite

956
00:49:56.632 --> 00:49:58.859
I could almost believe
that we had been friends

957
00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:01.089
these last few years and not dire enemies!

958
00:50:01.090 --> 00:50:04.209
Indeed. it seems mere
minutes since we fought

959
00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:06.632
a bloody battle up at Holmedon Hill.

960
00:50:06.633 --> 00:50:08.716
I'faith I curse myself I was not ta'en

961
00:50:08.717 --> 00:50:10.950
to be your lordship's prisoner before!

962
00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:15.489
In gratitude I shall commit my strength

963
00:50:15.490 --> 00:50:17.942
to topple Henry Bolingbroke. your king.

964
00:50:17.943 --> 00:50:19.196
With Harry Hotspur fighting on our side

965
00:50:19.197 --> 00:50:22.299
I have no doubt we shall
find swift success!

966
00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.057
Well said. and many
thanks. my noble Scot.

967
00:50:26.666 --> 00:50:28.449
Ah. um--

968
00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:29.907
Lady Katherine!

969
00:50:30.966 --> 00:50:33.821
My humble thanks for all
thy golden generosity!

970
00:50:33.822 --> 00:50:37.629
I'm glad I saw you ere we part to say

971
00:50:37.630 --> 00:50:42.593
truly. by'm'heart thou art so becoming

972
00:50:43.750 --> 00:50:47.669
truly. my heart breaks that I'll be-going.

973
00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:52.835
We'll muster up our
cousins and ride south

974
00:50:52.836 --> 00:50:54.789
to join with you at Bangor by the ninth.

975
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:56.431
Thanks once again. old foe

976
00:50:56.432 --> 00:50:58.959
and new-forged friend.

977
00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:01.599
I'll ride out with you
till our paths diverge.

978
00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.359
Yet stay. my husband. We must talk.

979
00:51:06.768 --> 00:51:07.929
I'll join you momentarily.

980
00:51:07.930 --> 00:51:09.593
Good luck!

981
00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:13.719
How now. my wife? Have
you some suit to me?

982
00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:17.499
A suit? Am I to make appointments
to speak with thee now?

983
00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.879
My hennin is upstairs.

984
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.739
Shall I put on my formal robes. my lord?

985
00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:23.192
Nay. but speak quickly:
I am called away.

986
00:51:23.193 --> 00:51:27.189
'Tis true thou art. my
husband. called 'away.'

987
00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:29.919
'Away' should be thy middle name. i'faith

988
00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.946
for when I call out
'Harry' these stone walls

989
00:51:32.947 --> 00:51:35.863
repeat 'Away. ' 'Away. ' in echoing sobs.

990
00:51:36.970 --> 00:51:39.519
For what offence have I
these long months been

991
00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.995
a banished woman from my Harry's bed?

992
00:51:42.910 --> 00:51:46.869
No tenderness have I of thee enjoyed

993
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:51.847
no kisses. nor no touches. comforts. sighs

994
00:51:51.848 --> 00:51:54.699
in weeks. nay months!

995
00:51:54.700 --> 00:51:56.623
Unnatural spans of time!

996
00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:03.193
I am thy wife; aren't not my husband too?

997
00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:08.390
Am I not pleasing to thee anymore?

998
00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.009
I must know. Harry. else
thou love'st me not!

999
00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:13.546
What is that carries you away?

1000
00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:16.226
Away. away. you trifler! Love!

1001
00:52:16.227 --> 00:52:17.468
I love thee not!

1002
00:52:21.359 --> 00:52:25.049
Do you not love me? Do you not. indeed?

1003
00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:27.883
I love thee infinitely.

1004
00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:31.539
But hark you. Kate

1005
00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:34.299
whither I must. I must; and. to conclude

1006
00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:38.409
this evening must I
leave you. gentle Kate.

1007
00:52:38.410 --> 00:52:42.579
I know you wise. but yet no farther wise

1008
00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:45.729
than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are

1009
00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:48.846
yet constantly you are a woman. Kate

1010
00:52:48.847 --> 00:52:50.076
and so far will I trust--

1011
00:52:50.077 --> 00:52:51.129
Oh! So far.

1012
00:52:51.130 --> 00:52:52.588
Not an inch further!

1013
00:52:57.610 --> 00:53:00.399
But hark you. Kate

1014
00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:03.013
whither I go. thither shall you go too.

1015
00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:07.899
Today I will set forth. tomorrow you.

1016
00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:11.034
Will this content you. Kate?

1017
00:53:11.035 --> 00:53:13.585
It must. of force.

1018
00:53:51.412 --> 00:53:53.672
Are you all right?

1019
00:53:53.673 --> 00:53:56.765
What sayest thou. good maid?

1020
00:53:56.766 --> 00:53:59.107
I said are you alright?

1021
00:53:59.108 --> 00:54:01.272
I do not need attending at this time.

1022
00:54:03.055 --> 00:54:04.975
Okay.

1023
00:54:04.976 --> 00:54:06.143
Art married?

1024
00:54:06.987 --> 00:54:08.650
Uh. married? Me?

1025
00:54:08.651 --> 00:54:10.069
Yes. Art thou wed?

1026
00:54:10.070 --> 00:54:11.611
Uh. no.

1027
00:54:11.612 --> 00:54:12.634
Ah. Well.

1028
00:54:12.635 --> 00:54:14.905
You probably have to
work at it. I imagine?

1029
00:54:14.906 --> 00:54:16.730
Yes! Thou art correct.

1030
00:54:16.731 --> 00:54:19.025
It is hard work.

1031
00:54:19.026 --> 00:54:21.247
I'm sure she loves you. really.

1032
00:54:21.248 --> 00:54:22.081
She?

1033
00:54:22.947 --> 00:54:25.321
Uh-uh. no no no no. Um...

1034
00:54:25.322 --> 00:54:27.647
he. him. your husband. Hotspur?

1035
00:54:27.648 --> 00:54:29.709
I'm sure he loves you really.

1036
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:33.039
Sometimes I feel like
I do not know the man.

1037
00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:35.739
I gaze rather upon a fixed portrait

1038
00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:38.739
a hollow suit of armour brought to life.

1039
00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:40.330
Yeah. I know what you mean.

1040
00:54:41.210 --> 00:54:43.843
Has't thou experience
with men? With love?

1041
00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:46.366
There is no need to blush

1042
00:54:46.367 --> 00:54:49.393
I do not ask to wring confession
from thee for thy sins.

1043
00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:54.369
I know how pretty maids
can turn men's heads

1044
00:54:54.370 --> 00:54:55.989
I know attention has a double edge.

1045
00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:58.719
In nine parts loathsome irritation

1046
00:54:58.720 --> 00:55:01.637
and in one part a begrudging flattery.

1047
00:55:03.428 --> 00:55:06.309
Ooh. yeah! I know what you mean there.

1048
00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:10.290
I have some experience with
men. with guys. they're...

1049
00:55:10.291 --> 00:55:12.623
Generally fine.

1050
00:55:13.458 --> 00:55:15.429
If that's what you're into.

1051
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:18.165
I'm actually mostly a lesbian.

1052
00:55:18.166 --> 00:55:22.528
A lesbian? What sort of thing is that?

1053
00:55:22.529 --> 00:55:24.584
It is a religious order. like a nun?

1054
00:55:25.943 --> 00:55:28.833
Well. you could say it's a calling.

1055
00:55:29.827 --> 00:55:33.159
Sometimes I feel like I've
taken a vow of celibacy.

1056
00:55:34.418 --> 00:55:37.029
I took a solemn vow before God too.

1057
00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:41.582
I promised to love. honour and obey.

1058
00:55:41.583 --> 00:55:45.879
I gained so much - this
castle. servants and

1059
00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.979
all of the respect and admiration

1060
00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:50.589
that suits a lady of my birth.

1061
00:55:50.590 --> 00:55:53.469
I was the eldest child -
my parents did not know

1062
00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:54.789
that they would have my brother after me

1063
00:55:54.790 --> 00:55:57.249
being advanced in years when I was born.

1064
00:55:57.250 --> 00:56:00.849
And so I was taught to
think. to shoot. to write

1065
00:56:00.850 --> 00:56:03.819
to manage an estate: my parents planned

1066
00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:05.619
to make me their inheritor!

1067
00:56:06.711 --> 00:56:08.722
But then my brother Edmund was born.

1068
00:56:08.723 --> 00:56:11.979
And do not think that I do
not love him. or that I am

1069
00:56:11.980 --> 00:56:15.399
ungrateful for these
things that I've gained.

1070
00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:20.349
A husband well respected. gallant. strong

1071
00:56:20.350 --> 00:56:24.373
advancing into the world.
as he withdraws from me.

1072
00:56:26.836 --> 00:56:27.669
But I...

1073
00:56:29.094 --> 00:56:32.876
Some days I feel the lack

1074
00:56:32.877 --> 00:56:36.009
of that which I have
lost. most principally

1075
00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:38.383
the future I imagined for myself.

1076
00:56:39.580 --> 00:56:43.959
I am a wife. Now just a wife.

1077
00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:47.932
Nay. no. not 'just. ' I do
not mean to make it small.

1078
00:56:47.933 --> 00:56:52.839
It is a joy. it is a duty. I am blessed.

1079
00:56:52.840 --> 00:56:54.729
And yet--

1080
00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:58.554
It's tough when people see
you only in relation to men.

1081
00:56:58.555 --> 00:57:01.704
Yes! That is what I
mean. those are the words!

1082
00:57:01.705 --> 00:57:05.079
I read Protagoras - for I can read.

1083
00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:09.729
He wrote. 'Man is the
measure of all things.'

1084
00:57:09.730 --> 00:57:14.319
But why 'man. ' why not
'woman?' Why say 'man?'

1085
00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:17.409
When hast thou seen a smith or a carpenter

1086
00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:20.379
decrease in skill by practising his craft?

1087
00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:24.006
Why then do men insult the work of God

1088
00:57:24.007 --> 00:57:26.956
claiming all heavenly attributes for Adam

1089
00:57:26.957 --> 00:57:30.129
and leaving none for Eve. His second made?

1090
00:57:30.130 --> 00:57:32.936
Was Athena the lesser for her sex?

1091
00:57:32.937 --> 00:57:37.059
Hippolyta not roused by
that same Sun as Hercules?

1092
00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:40.209
Would Cleopatra's reign
have been more golden still

1093
00:57:40.210 --> 00:57:42.081
had she possessed that which she lacked?

1094
00:57:42.082 --> 00:57:42.915
Yes!

1095
00:57:44.893 --> 00:57:47.153
Oh sorry. not 'yes' as in
it would have been better

1096
00:57:47.154 --> 00:57:49.044
'yes' as in. yeees!

1097
00:57:50.946 --> 00:57:53.979
It's tough. Like. I
guess women in the 14...

1098
00:57:55.540 --> 00:57:59.529
Women now... Don't have loads of options.

1099
00:57:59.530 --> 00:58:03.039
Like. you can think all that
stuff and say all that stuff

1100
00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:07.979
but you still do sort
of have to get married.

1101
00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:11.319
And it does have to be to a man.

1102
00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:15.022
Yeah. knowing your situation is cool

1103
00:58:15.023 --> 00:58:18.945
and I don't think you're
bad or sinful or whatever

1104
00:58:18.946 --> 00:58:20.638
for feeling frustrated.

1105
00:58:22.030 --> 00:58:24.941
But yeah. you can't just fix the world

1106
00:58:24.942 --> 00:58:27.213
by changing your attitude.

1107
00:58:27.214 --> 00:58:29.829
I guess that's what I'm trying to say.

1108
00:58:29.830 --> 00:58:32.070
It's a bit of a fucking shitter. innit?

1109
00:58:34.228 --> 00:58:38.568
It's a bit
of a fucking shitter. innit?

1110
00:58:38.569 --> 00:58:41.164
Hah! I like the way thou speak'st.

1111
00:58:42.314 --> 00:58:44.201
Yes! it's interesting.

1112
00:58:44.202 --> 00:58:48.069
It's less...
What am I trying to say?

1113
00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:51.480
Always have to...

1114
00:58:54.340 --> 00:58:56.447
Well. there is much to do

1115
00:58:56.448 --> 00:58:57.613
much to attend.

1116
00:58:57.614 --> 00:58:59.576
I thank thee for thy sympathetic ear

1117
00:58:59.577 --> 00:59:01.449
and I charge thee. on thy order

1118
00:59:01.450 --> 00:59:04.269
do not to speak to any
other of what I confessed.

1119
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:06.489
Keep thou my words in total secrecy

1120
00:59:06.490 --> 00:59:08.829
as if I spake them in that sacrament.

1121
00:59:08.830 --> 00:59:11.868
Be like a priest. be like a lesbian!

1122
00:59:14.680 --> 00:59:17.649
Like a priest. got it. Um...

1123
00:59:17.650 --> 00:59:19.571
Yeah. I'm not gonna tell anyone.

1124
00:59:20.758 --> 00:59:23.096
Go to thy duties then. And me to mine.

1125
00:59:26.236 --> 00:59:28.060
Come. show me the map.

1126
00:59:28.061 --> 00:59:28.894
Oh heck.

1127
00:59:30.052 --> 00:59:32.003
Let's carve up land!

1128
00:59:32.004 --> 00:59:34.237
I have divided England equally.

1129
00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:38.745
All land from Trent and Severn hitherto -

1130
00:59:38.746 --> 00:59:41.619
by south and east to Mortimer is assign'd.

1131
00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:44.106
All westward. Wales
beyond the Severn shore

1132
00:59:44.107 --> 00:59:47.769
to Owen Glendower: brother. to you

1133
00:59:47.770 --> 00:59:49.989
the remnant northward.
lying off from Trent

1134
00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:54.129
which someday you will
hand down to your son.

1135
00:59:54.130 --> 00:59:57.459
So our indentures tripartite are drawn

1136
00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:00.669
which being sealèd interchangeably

1137
01:00:00.670 --> 01:00:03.819
tomorrow we set forth to Shrewsbury

1138
01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:06.669
where we shall gather
together tenants. friends

1139
01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:10.389
and neighbouring gentlemen into one power.

1140
01:00:10.390 --> 01:00:14.470
And after that. alea iacta est!

1141
01:00:14.471 --> 01:00:19.469
The die is cast and we shall win or lose.

1142
01:00:19.470 --> 01:00:22.149
Which nobles likely
head the king's forces?

1143
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:24.699
The Earl of Stafford. and of Westmorland

1144
01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:27.159
perhaps Prince John.

1145
01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.341
Perhaps the Prince of Wales?

1146
01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:34.599
I hope he drinks his courage
deep enough to face me!

1147
01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.639
Has he given you some offence?

1148
01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:39.669
His every step. his every word offends

1149
01:00:39.670 --> 01:00:42.119
in breathing. nay. in looking he offends.

1150
01:00:42.954 --> 01:00:45.786
His cringing. whinging nature breeds--

1151
01:00:49.103 --> 01:00:54.103
Lord Hotspur. um sorry to
interrupt. Can I've a word?

1152
01:00:54.327 --> 01:00:56.319
Verily it 'tis important.

1153
01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.790
See to it that you
do return him straight!

1154
01:01:04.751 --> 01:01:07.329
Thou hast thy audience:
what is the news?

1155
01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:08.949
Uh. hello?

1156
01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:12.099
You met me at Holmedon
Hill. then in London?

1157
01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:13.967
I'm the girl from Framlingham.

1158
01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:18.039
Okay. I shook your hand
and something happened.

1159
01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:19.719
I think we might be connected. maybe

1160
01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.819
- because we're both--
- Go to!

1161
01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:22.749
Do not approach me. get thee hence!

1162
01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.009
I just need to speak to you.

1163
01:01:24.010 --> 01:01:26.349
I care not who thou
art or whence thou came

1164
01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:28.779
but get thee back there with expedience.

1165
01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:32.529
Thy face portends unwelcome happenings.

1166
01:01:32.530 --> 01:01:35.709
Strange sights and painful shocks

1167
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:36.610
I say go to!

1168
01:01:36.611 --> 01:01:40.423
- I'm trying to go to.
- I'm going and I'm to-ing!

1169
01:01:42.604 --> 01:01:44.839
I thought maybe you'd like to go too?

1170
01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:47.296
I have a kingdom that I must o'erturn.

1171
01:01:47.297 --> 01:01:49.959
A mission to fulfil. a crown to win!

1172
01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.907
But your Dad keeps calling you his son.

1173
01:01:52.908 --> 01:01:55.329
An-and your uncle calls you his nephew.

1174
01:01:55.330 --> 01:02:00.067
Your wife calls you
her... Husband. Do you...

1175
01:02:02.920 --> 01:02:05.388
Do you really not know?

1176
01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:07.222
Know what?

1177
01:02:12.157 --> 01:02:15.093
- There you are. sugarspice.
- Found you at last!

1178
01:02:15.968 --> 01:02:17.895
Where the bloody hell have you been?

1179
01:02:17.896 --> 01:02:20.379
Oh. we got caught on
opposite sides of a transition.

1180
01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:22.045
Too right.

1181
01:02:24.700 --> 01:02:26.881
Look. what's supposed
to happen in this scene?

1182
01:02:26.882 --> 01:02:28.372
Ah. thank you.

1183
01:02:29.690 --> 01:02:31.299
Looks like the rebels
are planning the attack.

1184
01:02:31.300 --> 01:02:33.782
Hotspur and Worcester do some negotiating.

1185
01:02:33.783 --> 01:02:35.964
Kate comes in. they have another argument

1186
01:02:35.965 --> 01:02:36.889
and then

1187
01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:39.806
that's it. we're into the interval.

1188
01:02:40.970 --> 01:02:44.298
Why is Douglas here.
he's not in this scene?

1189
01:02:44.299 --> 01:02:46.795
And where are Mortimer and Glendower?

1190
01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:50.099
I don't know. I don't
even know who Mortimer

1191
01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.875
and Glendower even are.

1192
01:02:55.030 --> 01:02:56.253
What did you do?

1193
01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.477
Nothing! Nothing. I didn't do any--

1194
01:02:59.478 --> 01:03:01.151
Give me that map!

1195
01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:04.097
Oh no. no. no! This is all wrong!

1196
01:03:04.098 --> 01:03:06.560
Mortimer and Glendower
are supposed to be here!

1197
01:03:06.561 --> 01:03:10.541
Glendower has to exit and
then come back on with Kate.

1198
01:03:10.542 --> 01:03:11.375
With--

1199
01:03:12.568 --> 01:03:13.900
All right. Well. we can skip

1200
01:03:13.901 --> 01:03:16.801
- this part. come on.
- No. Sam! Just watch this.

1201
01:03:16.802 --> 01:03:17.670
Come on.

1202
01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.629
Good morrow. wife.

1203
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:24.699
Good morrow. my husband.

1204
01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.999
I feared you would not
deign to meet us here

1205
01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.899
for what I said and how I spoke to you.

1206
01:03:31.900 --> 01:03:34.899
Such warring words
are poor ground indeed

1207
01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:37.269
to build a marriage on't.

1208
01:03:37.270 --> 01:03:38.533
I know none else.

1209
01:03:40.210 --> 01:03:44.014
Forgive me that I said I loved thee not

1210
01:03:44.015 --> 01:03:48.180
and called thee trifler.
and raised my voice.

1211
01:03:49.660 --> 01:03:52.628
I hear thy heartfelt plea. my noble lord

1212
01:03:52.629 --> 01:03:55.382
and it has pierced my
woman's breast as if...

1213
01:03:56.597 --> 01:03:59.829
Uh. I feel like
I'm supposed to forgive you

1214
01:03:59.830 --> 01:04:01.231
but I don't want to.

1215
01:04:02.066 --> 01:04:04.299
I gave up who I was to become your wife.

1216
01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.080
That wasn't trifling.

1217
01:04:06.081 --> 01:04:08.259
But I don't want to look at
the things I left behind.

1218
01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:11.385
I want to look at the things
we could have. together.

1219
01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:18.157
I am most moved by
your words. good my wife

1220
01:04:18.158 --> 01:04:19.867
and I...

1221
01:04:26.410 --> 01:04:27.962
Fuck it! Um...

1222
01:04:31.801 --> 01:04:33.212
I'm really sorry.

1223
01:04:34.687 --> 01:04:36.400
I'm really. really. really sorry.

1224
01:04:36.401 --> 01:04:37.234
And...

1225
01:04:38.618 --> 01:04:39.451
I love you.

1226
01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:41.593
I love you too.

1227
01:04:52.849 --> 01:04:54.075
Did you feel that?

1228
01:04:54.076 --> 01:04:55.599
I did!

1229
01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.429
I think I've felt this way once before

1230
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:59.906
when I met this girl. up at Holmedon.

1231
01:05:01.215 --> 01:05:02.386
Did you kiss her too?

1232
01:05:02.387 --> 01:05:05.799
No! No. I-- I shook her hand.

1233
01:05:05.800 --> 01:05:06.640
When was this?

1234
01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:07.640
It was months ago.

1235
01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:12.519
Although it feels like
it wasn't that long?

1236
01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.231
Do you know something weird?

1237
01:05:14.232 --> 01:05:15.841
I don't know how I got here.

1238
01:05:15.842 --> 01:05:17.741
I was just in Alnwick. and now I'm here.

1239
01:05:17.742 --> 01:05:18.851
But you don't remember the journey?

1240
01:05:18.852 --> 01:05:21.110
- No!
- Neither do I!

1241
01:05:21.111 --> 01:05:26.111
I went from Holemdon to
Alnwick to London and now Wales

1242
01:05:26.118 --> 01:05:28.273
but I don't think I've
spent any time on the road

1243
01:05:28.274 --> 01:05:30.456
or if I have. then I don't remember it.

1244
01:05:31.744 --> 01:05:32.673
What was that?

1245
01:05:32.673 --> 01:05:33.506
Do you know something else?

1246
01:05:33.507 --> 01:05:36.309
When I was in London. I thought my father

1247
01:05:36.310 --> 01:05:38.323
looked exactly like King Henry...

1248
01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.555
They do look similar!

1249
01:05:41.865 --> 01:05:44.529
No no no. like they had the same face.

1250
01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:46.661
I didn't even recognise my Dad at first.

1251
01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:49.584
Ah! What's this?

1252
01:05:49.585 --> 01:05:51.433
I've never seen this before!

1253
01:05:51.434 --> 01:05:53.529
I think something's wrong here?

1254
01:05:53.530 --> 01:05:55.753
So do I. And do you know what else?

1255
01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.882
I feel like we're being watched.

1256
01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:06.701
I've just had a thought.

1257
01:06:06.702 --> 01:06:10.260
Here we are. planning to
overthrow Henry Bolingbroke

1258
01:06:10.261 --> 01:06:12.418
and install Edmund Mortimer as King

1259
01:06:12.419 --> 01:06:15.519
but have either of you
ever stopped to ask like...

1260
01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:18.408
Why we even have a hereditary
monarchy in the first place?

1261
01:06:25.338 --> 01:06:27.322
I've just had a thought as well.

1262
01:06:28.272 --> 01:06:30.657
I wonder if my military offensives

1263
01:06:30.658 --> 01:06:32.019
over the last several years

1264
01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:34.059
although profitable in the short-term

1265
01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:35.229
have perhaps contributed

1266
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:37.839
to a decreasing geopolitical
stability in the border region

1267
01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:40.310
that actually hampers my long-term goals?

1268
01:06:40.311 --> 01:06:41.828
See. I think I'd have more success

1269
01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:45.074
pursuing a more cooperative
and peaceful foreign policy

1270
01:06:45.075 --> 01:06:47.857
rather than one which requiring
constant military victory

1271
01:06:47.858 --> 01:06:49.992
and which relies so heavily
on projecting an image

1272
01:06:49.993 --> 01:06:51.321
of toxic masculinity.

1273
01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:59.629
My lords. my Lady Katherine.
your beds are ready for you!

1274
01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:01.569
♪ Look. the hour grows late.

1275
01:07:01.570 --> 01:07:02.560
Will you come in?

1276
01:07:02.561 --> 01:07:04.899
Tomorrow you must ride for Shrewsbury

1277
01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:06.519
and you shall need your strength

1278
01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:08.739
if you are to repair those grievous wrongs

1279
01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:11.756
that Henry Bolingbroke has done you all.

1280
01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:15.514
Indeed. well said. good knight.

1281
01:07:15.515 --> 01:07:16.709
Let's all to bed.

1282
01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:19.189
This heavy business
must have dulled my mind

1283
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:21.639
for I was briefly carried quite away

1284
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.459
by philosophic contemplation.

1285
01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:27.292
But there are many real things to attend!

1286
01:07:28.367 --> 01:07:29.200
Indeed!

1287
01:07:29.201 --> 01:07:31.419
Shortly we shall rush unto the field

1288
01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:34.089
all harnessed with our
weapons borne aloft!

1289
01:07:34.090 --> 01:07:36.322
O what a glorious victory we shall win!

1290
01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:02.653
Somewhere King Henry
watches that same sun

1291
01:08:03.610 --> 01:08:07.659
and in its slow descent foresees his fall

1292
01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:10.239
for sure he knows he shall not see it rise

1293
01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:12.733
more than a dozen times again in life.

1294
01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:16.933
I shall see my son rise to topple him.

1295
01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:20.953
I am no sun.

1296
01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:28.510
I am the moon. reflecting
but a light you shine on me.

1297
01:08:28.511 --> 01:08:32.679
Not so. the
country's eyes do look to thee.

1298
01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.086
In all the towns we pass
through the men cry out

1299
01:08:35.087 --> 01:08:38.919
'It's Harry Hotspur!' Not Northumberland.

1300
01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:42.068
I heard it rumoured
that the Prince of Wales

1301
01:08:42.069 --> 01:08:45.519
fled straight to France
the moment thou rode out!

1302
01:08:45.520 --> 01:08:47.139
He does not have a reputation

1303
01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:49.285
for great prowess in military scenes.

1304
01:08:50.361 --> 01:08:51.194
Indeed.

1305
01:08:54.939 --> 01:08:58.358
In truth. I pity his father.

1306
01:08:58.359 --> 01:09:01.809
The Prince of Wales
cancels all filial bonds

1307
01:09:01.810 --> 01:09:03.789
by heaping ignominy on himself

1308
01:09:03.790 --> 01:09:07.176
and I am sure his father takes it hard.

1309
01:09:08.290 --> 01:09:12.699
To lose a child to war or accident

1310
01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:14.978
or any deadly shock. that is a hell

1311
01:09:14.979 --> 01:09:18.133
that I pray thou wilt never fall into.

1312
01:09:21.130 --> 01:09:24.369
But losing a child because
they bring you shame

1313
01:09:24.370 --> 01:09:27.999
must be a deeper still infernal pit.

1314
01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.818
The shameful child reminds one

1315
01:09:30.819 --> 01:09:33.999
of their transgression
every day and in consequence

1316
01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.499
their face becomes a murder or a rape.

1317
01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.349
A violation written in that flesh

1318
01:09:41.350 --> 01:09:43.989
which once was smiling.
bouncing in your arms

1319
01:09:43.990 --> 01:09:47.473
now unwelcome and unfamiliar.

1320
01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:51.039
One's mourning clothes are worn invisibly

1321
01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:54.099
for shame is hidden in the empty heart

1322
01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:57.553
and speaking shame
aloud doth triple shame.

1323
01:09:58.930 --> 01:10:02.679
False smiles hiding tears
fill up all the days

1324
01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:06.459
until. I am told. by
most unfortunate friends

1325
01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:09.626
the parent wishes their
own child were dead.

1326
01:10:15.730 --> 01:10:17.936
I am proud of thee. Harry

1327
01:10:17.937 --> 01:10:20.803
I thank God thou art my son.

1328
01:10:22.145 --> 01:10:23.627
I am relieved

1329
01:10:23.628 --> 01:10:26.466
to see a bloom of strength and fortitude

1330
01:10:26.467 --> 01:10:30.009
in thee that in myself I have felt fading

1331
01:10:30.010 --> 01:10:32.443
as my own sun sets.

1332
01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.429
- Dad--
- I will not always be here.

1333
01:10:36.430 --> 01:10:40.479
None can choose the hour which
they must depart this life.

1334
01:10:40.480 --> 01:10:43.629
Before we ride for Shrewsbury I will sign

1335
01:10:43.630 --> 01:10:46.149
the deeds of thy inheritance.

1336
01:10:46.150 --> 01:10:50.499
Thy name shall be inscribed
and thou shalt take possession

1337
01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:54.219
of all legal property.
including Alnwick Castle

1338
01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:55.477
and its grounds

1339
01:10:55.478 --> 01:10:58.101
that our great ancestors. and thy father

1340
01:10:58.102 --> 01:11:00.560
have handed down the ages for thy hands.

1341
01:11:02.530 --> 01:11:05.939
I make an early gift of this to thee.

1342
01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:12.667
What happens at the end?

1343
01:11:12.668 --> 01:11:14.341
Give that back! You
don't know what you're doing!

1344
01:11:14.342 --> 01:11:17.300
What happens at the end
of "Henry IV" Part One?

1345
01:12:08.168 --> 01:12:11.319
Though yet of Hamlet
our dear brother's death

1346
01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:14.289
the memory be green.
and that it us befitted

1347
01:12:14.290 --> 01:12:18.609
to bear our hearts in
grief and our whole kingdom

1348
01:12:18.610 --> 01:12:22.929
to be contracted as one brow of woe

1349
01:12:22.930 --> 01:12:26.619
yet so far hath discretion
fought with nature

1350
01:12:26.620 --> 01:12:29.559
that we with wisest sorrow think on him

1351
01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:32.859
together with remembrance of ourselves.

1352
01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:36.834
Therefore our sometime sister

1353
01:12:36.835 --> 01:12:38.379
now our queen

1354
01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:40.959
have we. as 'twere with a defeated joy

1355
01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:44.559
with mirth in funeral and
with dirge in marriage

1356
01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.937
taken to wife.

1357
01:12:49.580 --> 01:12:53.379
Nor have we herein barr'd
your better wisdoms

1358
01:12:53.380 --> 01:12:56.115
which have freely gone
with this affair along.

1359
01:12:56.116 --> 01:12:57.615
For all. our thanks.

1360
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:05.079
Now follows. that you
know. young Fortinbras

1361
01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.539
holding a weak supposal of our worth

1362
01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:10.149
or thinking by our late
dear brother's death

1363
01:13:10.150 --> 01:13:11.949
our state to be disjoint

1364
01:13:11.950 --> 01:13:12.984
and out of frame

1365
01:13:12.985 --> 01:13:15.076
colleaguèd with the dream of his advantage

1366
01:13:15.077 --> 01:13:18.549
he hath not failed to
pester us with message

1367
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:21.519
importing the surrender of those lands

1368
01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.767
lost by his father. with all bonds of law

1369
01:13:24.768 --> 01:13:26.802
to our most valiant brother.

1370
01:13:26.803 --> 01:13:27.636
So much for him.

1371
01:13:28.656 --> 01:13:29.997
Oh Christ!

1372
01:13:29.998 --> 01:13:31.113
Now for ourself

1373
01:13:31.114 --> 01:13:32.438
and for this time of meeting

1374
01:13:32.439 --> 01:13:35.251
thus much the business
is: we have here writ

1375
01:13:35.252 --> 01:13:38.649
to Norway. uncle of Fortinbras

1376
01:13:38.650 --> 01:13:41.109
who. impotent and bed-rid. scarcely hears

1377
01:13:41.110 --> 01:13:44.469
of this his nephew's purpose - to suppress

1378
01:13:44.470 --> 01:13:47.649
his further gait herein;
in that the levies

1379
01:13:47.650 --> 01:13:49.582
lists and full proportions

1380
01:13:49.583 --> 01:13:50.533
are all made

1381
01:13:50.533 --> 01:13:51.457
- out of his subject--
- Give me the map.

1382
01:13:51.458 --> 01:13:53.190
- and we here dispatch--
- Give me the map.

1383
01:13:53.191 --> 01:13:54.881
- you. good Cornelius--
- Give me the map.

1384
01:13:54.882 --> 01:13:55.919
- our loyal friend--
- Give me the map.

1385
01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:58.629
for bearer of this greeting to old Norway

1386
01:13:58.630 --> 01:14:00.669
giving to you no further personal power

1387
01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:02.979
to business with the
king more than the scope

1388
01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.902
of these delated articles allow.

1389
01:14:05.768 --> 01:14:06.601
Farewell--

1390
01:14:06.601 --> 01:14:07.434
Give me the map!

1391
01:14:07.434 --> 01:14:08.370
and let your haste--

1392
01:14:08.370 --> 01:14:09.203
Give me the map. give me the map!

1393
01:14:09.203 --> 01:14:10.036
commend your duty.

1394
01:14:10.037 --> 01:14:11.410
Give me
the map! Give me the map!

1395
01:14:11.411 --> 01:14:14.139
In that and all things
I will show my duty.

1396
01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:16.419
We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell!

1397
01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:19.779
And now. Laertes. what
is the news with you?

1398
01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.389
You told us of some
suit; what is't. Laertes?

1399
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:25.089
Your leave and favour
to return to France

1400
01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:26.414
- from whence--
- Give it! Give it!

1401
01:14:26.415 --> 01:14:27.813
though willingly I came to Denmark--

1402
01:14:27.814 --> 01:14:28.895
To show my duty

1403
01:14:28.896 --> 01:14:32.456
in your coronation. yet now.
I must confess. that duty done

1404
01:14:32.457 --> 01:14:35.072
my thoughts and wishes
bend again toward France

1405
01:14:35.907 --> 01:14:37.849
and bow them to your gracious leave--

1406
01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:39.758
Give me the map!

1407
01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:42.680
Have you your father's leave?

1408
01:14:43.682 --> 01:14:46.071
He hath. my lord: wrung
from me my slow leave.

1409
01:14:46.906 --> 01:14:49.333
I do beseech you. give him leave to go.

1410
01:14:50.170 --> 01:14:51.394
Take thy fair hour

1411
01:14:51.395 --> 01:14:53.485
Laertes; time be thine

1412
01:14:53.486 --> 01:14:56.076
and thy best graces use it at thy will!

1413
01:15:00.130 --> 01:15:05.130
And now. Hamlet. our cousin. and our son

1414
01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:10.239
how is it that the
clouds still hang on you?

1415
01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:13.659
Not so. my lord; I
am too much i'the sun.

1416
01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:18.303
Good Hamlet. cast
thy nighted colour off.

1417
01:15:18.304 --> 01:15:21.939
Thou know'st 'tis common;
all that lives must die.

1418
01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:24.486
Passing through nature to eternity.

1419
01:15:24.487 --> 01:15:25.785
Ay. madam

1420
01:15:25.786 --> 01:15:27.309
it is common.

1421
01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:30.609
If it be. why seems it
so particular with thee?

1422
01:15:30.610 --> 01:15:33.969
Seems. madam! nay it
is; I know not 'seems.'

1423
01:15:33.970 --> 01:15:36.759
'Tis not alone my inky cloak. good mother

1424
01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:40.419
together with all forms.
moods. shapes of grief

1425
01:15:40.420 --> 01:15:44.889
that can denote me
truly: these indeed seem

1426
01:15:44.890 --> 01:15:48.609
for they are actions
that a man might play.

1427
01:15:48.610 --> 01:15:51.729
But I have that within which passeth show.

1428
01:15:51.730 --> 01:15:54.549
These but the trappings
and the suits of woe.

1429
01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:58.577
For your intent in going
back to school in Wittenberg

1430
01:15:58.578 --> 01:16:02.109
it is most retrograde to our desire.

1431
01:16:02.110 --> 01:16:05.635
And we beseech you. bend you to remain

1432
01:16:05.636 --> 01:16:08.649
here. in the cheer and comfort of our eye

1433
01:16:08.650 --> 01:16:11.946
our chiefest courtier. cousin. and son.

1434
01:16:11.947 --> 01:16:16.359
Let not thy
mother lose her prayers. Hamlet.

1435
01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:20.769
I pray you. stay with
us; go not to Wittenberg.

1436
01:16:20.770 --> 01:16:24.339
I shall in all my best obey you. madam.

1437
01:16:24.340 --> 01:16:27.343
Why. 'tis a loving and a fair reply.

1438
01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:32.566
Be as ourself in Denmark.

1439
01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:39.493
Madam. come.

1440
01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:49.433
O. that this too too
solid flesh would melt

1441
01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:53.286
thaw and resolve itself into a dew.

1442
01:16:54.583 --> 01:16:56.795
Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd

1443
01:16:56.796 --> 01:16:59.769
His canon 'gainst self-slaughter.

1444
01:16:59.770 --> 01:17:01.153
O God.

1445
01:17:02.338 --> 01:17:03.171
God!

1446
01:17:04.567 --> 01:17:09.189
How weary. stale. flat and unprofitable

1447
01:17:09.190 --> 01:17:12.969
seem to me all the uses of this world!

1448
01:17:12.970 --> 01:17:15.427
Whoa. Moood.

1449
01:17:17.419 --> 01:17:20.744
Fie on't! ah fie!

1450
01:17:20.745 --> 01:17:24.347
'tis an unweeded garden.
that grows to seed.

1451
01:17:24.348 --> 01:17:26.753
Things rank and gross in natur--

1452
01:17:26.754 --> 01:17:28.929
Ow! What the fuck!

1453
01:17:28.930 --> 01:17:29.770
Sorry! Hi.

1454
01:17:29.771 --> 01:17:31.539
Do you remember me?

1455
01:17:31.540 --> 01:17:33.355
I am glad to see you well!

1456
01:17:34.681 --> 01:17:38.370
Horatio!

1457
01:17:38.371 --> 01:17:40.158
Or I do forget myself!

1458
01:17:40.159 --> 01:17:41.331
Oh bloody hell.

1459
01:17:41.332 --> 01:17:44.259
But what. in faith.
make you from Wittenberg?

1460
01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:46.299
I didn't come from chuffing Wittenberg.

1461
01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:48.351
I'm from Framlingham!

1462
01:17:48.352 --> 01:17:51.219
Look. my name is Jen. okay?
We spoke about 20 minutes ago.

1463
01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:53.011
And I've come here. I've come here to

1464
01:17:53.012 --> 01:17:54.439
tell you something really important--

1465
01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:57.699
I pray thee. do not
mock me. fellow-student.

1466
01:17:57.700 --> 01:18:00.277
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

1467
01:18:00.278 --> 01:18:01.352
Oh. for fuck's sake!

1468
01:18:01.353 --> 01:18:03.849
Thrift. thrift. Horatio!

1469
01:18:03.850 --> 01:18:05.829
The funeral baked meats

1470
01:18:05.830 --> 01:18:09.283
did coldly furnish forth
the marriage tables!

1471
01:18:11.290 --> 01:18:12.193
My father!

1472
01:18:13.150 --> 01:18:15.504
Methinks I see my father.

1473
01:18:15.505 --> 01:18:16.338
Where?

1474
01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:22.869
In my mind's eye. Horatio.

1475
01:18:22.870 --> 01:18:25.939
Okay. right. let me save
you about five hours here.

1476
01:18:30.049 --> 01:18:34.015
Hm. your Dad's dead.
your uncle killed him.

1477
01:18:35.682 --> 01:18:38.799
Oh! Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern are wronguns

1478
01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.089
don't be mean to Ophelia

1479
01:18:40.090 --> 01:18:41.883
don't stab anyone through a curtain

1480
01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.569
uh. watch out for the Norwegians

1481
01:18:43.570 --> 01:18:46.036
and stay away from fencing tournaments.

1482
01:18:47.303 --> 01:18:51.262
Now this place. this world?
It's not what you think it is.

1483
01:18:51.263 --> 01:18:53.393
And you're not who you think you are.

1484
01:18:53.394 --> 01:18:55.569
Look. I know this gonna sound unbelievable

1485
01:18:55.570 --> 01:18:56.970
but I think you're really--

1486
01:18:56.971 --> 01:18:58.568
Hail to your Lordship!

1487
01:18:58.569 --> 01:19:00.879
Marcellus. hello!

1488
01:19:00.880 --> 01:19:03.039
What make you from
Wittenberg. my worthy friend?

1489
01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.052
A truant disposition. good my lord!

1490
01:19:05.053 --> 01:19:07.209
Oh. I would not hear your enemy say so

1491
01:19:07.210 --> 01:19:09.279
nor shall you do mine ear that violence

1492
01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:11.619
to truster your own
report against yourself.

1493
01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:12.879
I know you are no truant.

1494
01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:13.713
What are you doing?

1495
01:19:13.714 --> 01:19:15.699
My lord. I came to see
your father's funeral.

1496
01:19:15.700 --> 01:19:19.089
I saw him once; he was a goodly King.

1497
01:19:19.090 --> 01:19:23.552
He was a man. take him for all in all

1498
01:19:23.553 --> 01:19:25.509
I shall not look upon his like again.

1499
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:27.429
Sorry. excuse me. Prince Hamlet

1500
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:29.856
could I please borrow. um...

1501
01:19:29.857 --> 01:19:31.299
What's your name supposed to be?

1502
01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.133
Marcellus.

1503
01:19:32.134 --> 01:19:34.711
Can I borrow her? I'll
bring her right back!

1504
01:19:38.849 --> 01:19:40.259
No!

1505
01:19:40.260 --> 01:19:41.831
What are you doing?

1506
01:19:41.832 --> 01:19:43.476
I'm trying to fix your bloody mess!

1507
01:19:43.477 --> 01:19:46.232
No. Sam. you said these
characters are just antibodies.

1508
01:19:46.233 --> 01:19:48.649
They're not. she's
trapped here just like us!

1509
01:19:48.650 --> 01:19:50.289
Don't pretend you
have the slightest idea

1510
01:19:50.290 --> 01:19:51.265
what's going on down here

1511
01:19:51.266 --> 01:19:52.599
when 90 minutes ago you still believed

1512
01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.489
you were married to an Ancient Roman!

1513
01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:55.323
You need to sit down

1514
01:19:55.324 --> 01:19:56.838
and think about your behaviour. duck egg.

1515
01:19:56.839 --> 01:19:58.861
Everything was going fine
up there until you broke it.

1516
01:19:58.862 --> 01:20:00.845
Now we've been kicked all
the way down to the bottom!

1517
01:20:00.846 --> 01:20:02.197
So what?

1518
01:20:02.198 --> 01:20:04.064
Look. let's just tell her and we can all

1519
01:20:04.065 --> 01:20:05.279
find a way out together.

1520
01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:07.575
The only way out is back up there

1521
01:20:07.576 --> 01:20:09.824
at the end of "Henry IV" Part One

1522
01:20:09.825 --> 01:20:11.271
which we now can't get to

1523
01:20:11.272 --> 01:20:12.789
because one of the major characters

1524
01:20:12.790 --> 01:20:15.219
is having an identity crisis!

1525
01:20:15.220 --> 01:20:16.869
You're lucky we ended up in "Hamlet."

1526
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:18.819
If we'd fallen into "Titus Andronicus"

1527
01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:20.710
we could have been baked into pies!

1528
01:20:21.545 --> 01:20:24.879
I checked the map. I know
what happens to her at the end.

1529
01:20:24.880 --> 01:20:25.959
Well nothing happens now

1530
01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:28.477
because you've derailed the whole thing!

1531
01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:33.009
What's meant to happen is Prince Hal

1532
01:20:33.010 --> 01:20:35.079
proves himself worthy of the crown

1533
01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:39.073
by saving his father's life
and defeating Harry Hotspur.

1534
01:20:40.330 --> 01:20:41.774
She dies!

1535
01:20:41.775 --> 01:20:43.839
Hotspur ends up as the tragic foil

1536
01:20:43.840 --> 01:20:45.519
for Prince Hal's transformation--

1537
01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:46.659
But she dies!

1538
01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:48.279
Dies nobly.

1539
01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.749
Dies giving a beautiful speech

1540
01:20:49.750 --> 01:20:52.275
about time and life and honour.

1541
01:20:54.430 --> 01:20:56.619
Would you take that away?

1542
01:20:56.620 --> 01:20:58.809
Would you say. 'Hey.
actually. all those things

1543
01:20:58.810 --> 01:21:00.489
you think you did. all
those accomplishments

1544
01:21:00.490 --> 01:21:02.011
that was all a lie.

1545
01:21:02.012 --> 01:21:05.169
Those people that love you.
they don't really love you

1546
01:21:05.170 --> 01:21:07.467
they just love this
character you're performing.'

1547
01:21:08.318 --> 01:21:09.367
Do you think it's right

1548
01:21:09.368 --> 01:21:11.220
to inflict that kind of
knowledge on someone?

1549
01:21:11.221 --> 01:21:12.348
To rip them out of their life?

1550
01:21:12.349 --> 01:21:13.632
Cheat them out of their death?

1551
01:21:13.633 --> 01:21:16.345
They are here because they want to be.

1552
01:21:16.346 --> 01:21:18.189
Do you? Do you want to be stuck down here

1553
01:21:18.190 --> 01:21:20.710
like one of these dead-eyed zombie cunts?

1554
01:21:25.694 --> 01:21:28.186
I've been down here a long time.

1555
01:21:29.221 --> 01:21:33.023
A really. really fucking long time.

1556
01:21:33.024 --> 01:21:34.807
And I need to get out.

1557
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:40.663
I wasn't Cleopatra.

1558
01:21:42.340 --> 01:21:45.340
When I woke up in "Antony and
Cleopatra" I wasn't Cleopatra.

1559
01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:48.131
I was Messenger Number 7.

1560
01:21:49.265 --> 01:21:50.690
I had one line in Act III.

1561
01:21:52.489 --> 01:21:54.963
'The emperor calls Canidius.'

1562
01:21:57.130 --> 01:22:01.306
That was my whole character.
My whole world. one line.

1563
01:22:01.307 --> 01:22:02.840
It's not even ten syllables.

1564
01:22:04.190 --> 01:22:07.231
Even if you really milk
'emperor' it's still only nine.

1565
01:22:09.167 --> 01:22:13.982
I said that line until I
was sick to death of it.

1566
01:22:13.983 --> 01:22:16.329
I wanted to bash my brains
out or jump off a building.

1567
01:22:16.330 --> 01:22:19.719
I was so. so. tired of
being a minor character.

1568
01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:20.889
You at least got to be Portia.

1569
01:22:20.890 --> 01:22:23.829
You got to stand up there being beautiful

1570
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:27.480
and clever and have loads of lines. it...

1571
01:22:27.481 --> 01:22:29.123
It broke my heart.

1572
01:22:30.280 --> 01:22:32.626
One line was all of everything I ever got.

1573
01:22:34.690 --> 01:22:36.715
Until one night I realised

1574
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:39.973
I'm bigger than this!

1575
01:22:42.107 --> 01:22:45.459
And I deserve to have a bit of recognition

1576
01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:48.270
and self determination in life. don't I?

1577
01:22:52.690 --> 01:22:54.140
I worked hard to get that map

1578
01:22:54.983 --> 01:22:58.970
and to get you out. and now...

1579
01:23:01.660 --> 01:23:03.910
I don't have anything
left to give anymore.

1580
01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.373
I'm sorry.

1581
01:23:08.770 --> 01:23:11.353
Sam. I-I'm sorry. I got caught up in it.

1582
01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:20.143
Okay. let's go.

1583
01:23:21.310 --> 01:23:22.329
It might not be too late.

1584
01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:25.174
Maybe you can still get up
there and get to that door.

1585
01:23:25.175 --> 01:23:26.008
Okay?

1586
01:23:28.534 --> 01:23:30.025
Yeah.

1587
01:24:12.186 --> 01:24:13.984
Prince Hamlet?

1588
01:24:14.986 --> 01:24:17.418
Um. I'm sorry to have interrupted.

1589
01:24:19.253 --> 01:24:21.249
I just thought maybe
you'd like to come with us

1590
01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:23.283
rather than stay here.

1591
01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:31.753
To be

1592
01:24:36.416 --> 01:24:37.499
or not to be

1593
01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:41.379
that is the question.

1594
01:24:41.380 --> 01:24:44.589
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer

1595
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:48.913
the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune

1596
01:24:50.092 --> 01:24:51.898
or to

1597
01:24:51.899 --> 01:24:56.894
take arms against a sea of troubles

1598
01:24:56.895 --> 01:25:00.189
and by opposing end them?

1599
01:25:00.190 --> 01:25:05.177
To die: to sleep.

1600
01:25:05.178 --> 01:25:06.153
No more.

1601
01:25:08.079 --> 01:25:10.316
And by a sleep to say we end

1602
01:25:10.317 --> 01:25:14.919
the heart-ache and the
thousand natural shocks

1603
01:25:14.920 --> 01:25:19.449
that flesh is heir to. 'tis a consummation

1604
01:25:19.450 --> 01:25:21.267
devoutly to be wish'd.

1605
01:25:22.120 --> 01:25:25.363
To die. to sleep.

1606
01:25:30.790 --> 01:25:33.159
To sleep: perchance to dream.

1607
01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:34.766
Ay. there's the rub.

1608
01:25:34.767 --> 01:25:38.499
For in that sleep of
death what dreams may come

1609
01:25:38.500 --> 01:25:41.829
when we have shuffled off this mortal coil

1610
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:45.369
must give us pause: there's the respect

1611
01:25:45.370 --> 01:25:49.059
that makes calamity of so long life.

1612
01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:53.049
For who would bear the
whips and scorns of time

1613
01:25:53.050 --> 01:25:56.241
to grunt and sweat

1614
01:25:56.242 --> 01:25:58.929
under a weary life

1615
01:25:58.930 --> 01:26:02.553
but that the dread of
something after death

1616
01:26:04.630 --> 01:26:09.069
which makes us rather
bear those ills we have

1617
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:12.639
than fly to others that we know not of?

1618
01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:17.577
Thus conscience does
make cowards of us all

1619
01:26:17.578 --> 01:26:22.359
and thus the native hue of resolution

1620
01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:27.146
is sicklied o'er with
the pale cast of thought

1621
01:26:28.127 --> 01:26:31.760
and enterprises of great pith and moment

1622
01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:37.359
with this regard their currents turn awry

1623
01:26:37.360 --> 01:26:41.142
and lose the name of action.

1624
01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:07.413
Harry?

1625
01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:09.993
Kate?

1626
01:27:12.550 --> 01:27:15.069
Thy uncle charged me
that I bring thee this.

1627
01:27:15.070 --> 01:27:18.189
He bids thee put on thy armour at once.

1628
01:27:18.190 --> 01:27:19.974
Your powers are arranged at Shrewsbury

1629
01:27:19.975 --> 01:27:21.750
and soon King Henry's army will be here.

1630
01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:25.253
Wait...

1631
01:27:27.145 --> 01:27:29.925
I just said that because I'm supposed to.

1632
01:27:29.926 --> 01:27:32.576
I don't know how I got
here. or how you got here.

1633
01:27:32.577 --> 01:27:33.762
Harry. what's going on?

1634
01:27:33.763 --> 01:27:34.933
It's okay.

1635
01:27:35.980 --> 01:27:37.449
You've been dreaming.

1636
01:27:37.450 --> 01:27:39.309
I'll tell you what you need to do.

1637
01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:43.068
Give me that. then get on a
horse and ride back to Alnwick.

1638
01:27:43.069 --> 01:27:44.554
I don't even know how to ride a horse.

1639
01:27:44.555 --> 01:27:45.699
There's none back there anyway!

1640
01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:48.249
Of course you do. how
else did you get here?

1641
01:27:48.250 --> 01:27:49.350
I don't know!

1642
01:27:50.217 --> 01:27:51.300
I don't know.

1643
01:27:53.050 --> 01:27:56.379
I don't remember anything
except when I'm with you.

1644
01:27:56.380 --> 01:28:00.253
My whole life just exists
just to facilitate you!

1645
01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:03.939
Something's wrong. don't you
remember that conversation

1646
01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:05.876
we had at Alnwick and that noise?

1647
01:28:05.877 --> 01:28:07.479
It was just a dream.

1648
01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:09.911
Give me that and ride home. Kate.

1649
01:28:09.912 --> 01:28:12.159
Are you even listening to
me? Stop ordering me around!

1650
01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:15.999
That is thy role! That
is thy calling. Kate!

1651
01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:19.689
It is what God and Nature hath assigned.

1652
01:28:19.690 --> 01:28:22.419
It is not Woman's place to give commands.

1653
01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:26.169
It is not Woman's place to rule thyself.

1654
01:28:26.170 --> 01:28:28.809
I would be softer with thee if I could

1655
01:28:28.810 --> 01:28:33.810
but this our war is
forged of swords and mail.

1656
01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:37.479
No weakness nor no womanly gentleness

1657
01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:39.819
can we allow to creep into our hearts

1658
01:28:39.820 --> 01:28:41.769
and so thou must away.

1659
01:28:41.770 --> 01:28:43.885
Thou must.

1660
01:28:43.886 --> 01:28:44.719
Just go!

1661
01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:48.813
Fine.

1662
01:28:51.070 --> 01:28:52.286
It's impossible to be around you

1663
01:28:52.287 --> 01:28:53.561
when you're like this anyway.

1664
01:28:53.562 --> 01:28:56.060
I don't know how I've ever
managed to tolerate it.

1665
01:29:01.792 --> 01:29:04.423
Love. I suppose.

1666
01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:09.763
I love you.

1667
01:29:11.890 --> 01:29:15.253
One of you: the one who
actually communicates.

1668
01:29:18.430 --> 01:29:19.483
But this one

1669
01:29:22.330 --> 01:29:24.249
I'd rather walk into that darkness

1670
01:29:24.250 --> 01:29:26.685
and find my way through
than stay here with you.

1671
01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:30.320
Look at me! You've cut me in two as well.

1672
01:29:32.405 --> 01:29:35.327
I'm discarding the Kate that's
been acting as your spinoff.

1673
01:29:35.328 --> 01:29:36.861
I'm throwing her away.

1674
01:29:41.917 --> 01:29:44.459
And so I say goodbye

1675
01:29:46.417 --> 01:29:48.729
and I say good luck

1676
01:29:48.730 --> 01:29:51.082
but I'm saying it to other Harry

1677
01:29:51.083 --> 01:29:54.973
because this character that
I'm looking at right now

1678
01:29:56.830 --> 01:30:00.777
other Kate might have
loved you. but I don't.

1679
01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:11.289
Good morrow. nephew!

1680
01:30:11.290 --> 01:30:12.909
I just saw thy Kate come by me

1681
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:14.159
with her eyes all veiled in tears.

1682
01:30:14.160 --> 01:30:15.489
I sent her home.

1683
01:30:15.490 --> 01:30:19.000
Her woman's heart did break
in being parted from me

1684
01:30:19.001 --> 01:30:20.739
but t'was right.

1685
01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:23.679
My heart doth burn to
charge into the field!

1686
01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:26.709
The red hot breath of action roars in me!

1687
01:30:26.710 --> 01:30:29.379
Five hundred Cheshire yeoman have we. yes?

1688
01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:31.659
We shall arrange them up by Harlescott

1689
01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:33.789
Better to look down upon the field

1690
01:30:33.790 --> 01:30:37.149
and rain their missiles
on King Henry's power!

1691
01:30:37.150 --> 01:30:38.514
The cavalry from Wales--

1692
01:30:38.515 --> 01:30:40.227
Yea. yea. but first--

1693
01:30:40.228 --> 01:30:43.689
This letter comes
from old Northumberland.

1694
01:30:43.690 --> 01:30:46.138
A letter from him. Why
comes he not himself?

1695
01:30:46.139 --> 01:30:48.819
He cannot come: he
says he is grievous sick.

1696
01:30:48.820 --> 01:30:50.739
I prithee. tell me.
doth he keep his bed?

1697
01:30:50.740 --> 01:30:53.259
He did. his rider said. four days ago

1698
01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:54.969
and at the time of his departure thence

1699
01:30:54.970 --> 01:30:57.759
he was much feared by his physicians.

1700
01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:01.779
We must amend our plans: I say withdraw.

1701
01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:06.009
Yet all goes well. yet
all our joints are whole!

1702
01:31:06.010 --> 01:31:08.379
I loath to crush that
Spring in you. my lord

1703
01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:11.619
with further winter words
but here's further news.

1704
01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:14.919
The Earl of Westmoreland.
seven thousand strong

1705
01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:17.949
is marching hitherwards;
with him Prince John.

1706
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:20.229
No harm: what more?

1707
01:31:20.230 --> 01:31:22.149
And further. I have learn'd

1708
01:31:22.150 --> 01:31:25.449
the king himself in person is set forth

1709
01:31:25.450 --> 01:31:28.719
with strong and mighty preparation!

1710
01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:30.943
He shall be welcome too.

1711
01:31:32.140 --> 01:31:36.304
Where is his son. that
nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales

1712
01:31:36.305 --> 01:31:37.986
and his comrades?

1713
01:31:37.987 --> 01:31:40.869
All furnish'd. all in arms.

1714
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:44.049
All plumed like estridges
that with the wind

1715
01:31:44.050 --> 01:31:46.509
baited like eagles having lately bathed.

1716
01:31:46.510 --> 01:31:49.239
Glittering in golden coats. like images

1717
01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:51.309
as full of spirit as the month of May

1718
01:31:51.310 --> 01:31:52.749
and gorgeous as the sun--

1719
01:31:52.750 --> 01:31:57.716
Let them come on: they come
like sacrifices in their trim

1720
01:31:57.717 --> 01:32:00.541
and to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war

1721
01:32:00.542 --> 01:32:03.669
all hot and bleeding will we offer them!

1722
01:32:03.670 --> 01:32:05.169
We'll fight with him tonight.

1723
01:32:05.170 --> 01:32:07.736
Good nephew. be
advised; we must withdraw!

1724
01:32:07.737 --> 01:32:11.739
You speak but out of
fear and a cold heart.

1725
01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:15.219
Do me no slander. Douglas: by my life

1726
01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:17.439
I hold as little counsel with weak fear

1727
01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:20.409
as you my lord. or any man that lives!

1728
01:32:20.410 --> 01:32:22.959
The number of the king exceedeth ours.

1729
01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.989
For God's sake nephew. we must withdraw!

1730
01:32:25.990 --> 01:32:28.629
Thy father's sickness is a maim to us

1731
01:32:28.630 --> 01:32:31.269
a perilous gash. a very limb lopped off.

1732
01:32:31.270 --> 01:32:33.849
Before we rode from Bangor father gave

1733
01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:37.449
all deeds and rights of
my inheritance to me.

1734
01:32:37.450 --> 01:32:40.059
All powers and authority.

1735
01:32:40.060 --> 01:32:43.299
He trusted me to be our family.

1736
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:46.494
I am the latest in that line of sons

1737
01:32:46.495 --> 01:32:49.839
that stretcheth back
through centuries long gone.

1738
01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:53.533
Each drop of blood in
me doth bear that debt.

1739
01:32:55.360 --> 01:32:57.849
I'll play the
part of old Northumberland

1740
01:32:57.850 --> 01:33:00.699
and you shall see his manly strength in me

1741
01:33:00.700 --> 01:33:04.929
reflected as a blade reflects the sun.

1742
01:33:04.930 --> 01:33:09.189
My Lord of Worcester.
is this not Hotspur?

1743
01:33:09.190 --> 01:33:11.859
Why doubt you his prowess in leading us?

1744
01:33:11.860 --> 01:33:14.713
Have you no pride in
him? Have you no faith?

1745
01:33:16.270 --> 01:33:18.529
If Hotspur says that we can win this fight

1746
01:33:18.530 --> 01:33:21.703
then I shall stand
beside him and not quail.

1747
01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:26.799
Pray. do not take my caution as a sign

1748
01:33:26.800 --> 01:33:29.079
that I am not proud of thee.

1749
01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:34.080
I am. Thy life has run
by in so small a span.

1750
01:33:34.690 --> 01:33:38.619
Why I recall. but yesterday it seems

1751
01:33:38.620 --> 01:33:41.979
a little boy who stood not three feet high

1752
01:33:41.980 --> 01:33:44.169
and could not mount his horse.

1753
01:33:44.170 --> 01:33:48.009
I picked him up. I sat him in
the saddle. gave him reigns.

1754
01:33:48.010 --> 01:33:49.569
He galloped off.

1755
01:33:49.570 --> 01:33:52.377
And now he has returned

1756
01:33:52.378 --> 01:33:55.630
though I and that boy
both have been transformed

1757
01:33:55.631 --> 01:33:59.780
by time. and I see now

1758
01:33:59.781 --> 01:34:02.731
thou art a man.

1759
01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:10.209
Your love doth make
me twice the man I am.

1760
01:34:10.210 --> 01:34:13.989
And if I fall. so falls the man you know

1761
01:34:13.990 --> 01:34:17.561
with all these honours you bestow intact.

1762
01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:31.629
How now. my rebel lords!

1763
01:34:31.630 --> 01:34:34.689
It is not well that you and
I should meet upon such terms

1764
01:34:34.690 --> 01:34:36.249
as now we meet.

1765
01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:38.082
You have deceived our trust

1766
01:34:38.083 --> 01:34:41.139
making us doff the easy robes of peace

1767
01:34:41.140 --> 01:34:45.183
to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel.

1768
01:34:45.184 --> 01:34:48.189
It is not well. my lords. it is not well.

1769
01:34:48.190 --> 01:34:51.069
For mine own part. I
could be well content

1770
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:52.989
to entertain the lag-end of my life

1771
01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:55.689
with quiet hours; for I do protest

1772
01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:58.779
I have not sought the day of this dislike.

1773
01:34:58.780 --> 01:35:01.539
You have not sought it? Hah!

1774
01:35:01.540 --> 01:35:02.872
How comes it then?

1775
01:35:02.873 --> 01:35:05.319
It pleased your majesty
to turn your looks

1776
01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:09.099
of favour from myself and all our house!

1777
01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:12.189
If Hotspur's good
deserts have been forgot

1778
01:35:12.190 --> 01:35:15.459
we bid you name your
griefs and with all speed

1779
01:35:15.460 --> 01:35:18.099
you shall have your desires with interest

1780
01:35:18.100 --> 01:35:21.459
and pardon absolute for yourself and these

1781
01:35:21.460 --> 01:35:24.909
herein misled by your suggestion.

1782
01:35:24.910 --> 01:35:29.559
Do not believe this
snake. this King of smiles

1783
01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:31.839
who knows but how to promise. not to pay!

1784
01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:35.229
This must be Douglas.
Scotland's hairy thane

1785
01:35:35.230 --> 01:35:38.031
though out of orbit. Heaven
knows you're further south

1786
01:35:38.032 --> 01:35:39.249
than he has a right to be!

1787
01:35:39.250 --> 01:35:42.129
Your majesty should check the map again.

1788
01:35:42.130 --> 01:35:44.853
Put muzzles on your dog before he bites

1789
01:35:44.854 --> 01:35:46.519
or
you shall answer to the

1790
01:35:46.520 --> 01:35:47.353
crown for him.

1791
01:35:47.354 --> 01:35:50.709
We gave you that same royalty you wear.

1792
01:35:50.710 --> 01:35:53.229
And when you were not
six and twenty strong

1793
01:35:53.230 --> 01:35:57.489
sick in the world's
regard. wretched and low

1794
01:35:57.490 --> 01:36:01.029
my father gave you welcome to the shore.

1795
01:36:01.030 --> 01:36:03.309
And when the lords and barons of the realm

1796
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:06.819
perceived Northumberland did lean to you

1797
01:36:06.820 --> 01:36:11.169
the more and less came
in with cap and knee!

1798
01:36:11.170 --> 01:36:15.459
In short time after. you deposed the king.

1799
01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:18.579
Soon after that. deprived him of his life.

1800
01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:20.979
Disgraced me in my happy victories

1801
01:36:20.980 --> 01:36:23.469
rated mine uncle from the council-board.

1802
01:36:23.470 --> 01:36:26.469
In rage dismissed my
father from the court.

1803
01:36:26.470 --> 01:36:30.429
Broke oath on oath.
committed wrong on wrong

1804
01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:32.619
and in conclusion drove us to seek out

1805
01:36:32.620 --> 01:36:35.469
this head of safety; and withal to pry

1806
01:36:35.470 --> 01:36:38.619
into your title. the which we find

1807
01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:41.499
too indirect for long continuance!

1808
01:36:41.500 --> 01:36:43.359
These things indeed you have articulate

1809
01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:46.149
with some fine colour
that may please the eye

1810
01:36:46.150 --> 01:36:48.459
to face the garment of rebellion.

1811
01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:50.679
In both our armies there is many a soul

1812
01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:54.099
shall pay full dearly for this encounter

1813
01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:55.869
if once they join in trial.

1814
01:36:55.870 --> 01:37:00.870
Therefore Hotspur: I do not
think a braver gentleman

1815
01:37:00.877 --> 01:37:04.239
more active-valiant or more valiant-young

1816
01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:07.813
more daring or more bold. is now alive.

1817
01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:14.623
For my part. I may speak it to my shame

1818
01:37:14.624 --> 01:37:18.398
I have a truant been to chivalry

1819
01:37:18.399 --> 01:37:21.489
yet this before my father's majesty

1820
01:37:21.490 --> 01:37:24.279
I will. to save the blood on either side

1821
01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:27.146
try fortune with you in a single fight.

1822
01:37:28.930 --> 01:37:32.169
You cannot offer this in earnestness.

1823
01:37:32.170 --> 01:37:35.866
Presume not that I am the thing I was

1824
01:37:35.867 --> 01:37:39.424
for God doth know. so
shall the world perceive

1825
01:37:39.425 --> 01:37:41.799
that I have turn'd away my former self.

1826
01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:45.050
In thy image I now create my life.

1827
01:37:45.051 --> 01:37:49.209
An image. nothing more. a thin shadow

1828
01:37:49.210 --> 01:37:52.479
a mere player dressing as a man.

1829
01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:56.743
So much art thou. a fake. a counterfeit!

1830
01:37:58.300 --> 01:38:01.279
I'll rip thy honour from thee at the root!

1831
01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:05.199
I'll drag thee 10 times
round the walls of Troy

1832
01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:08.116
and make a trophy of thy battered corpse!

1833
01:38:08.117 --> 01:38:10.390
♪ This quarrel lies not just

1834
01:38:10.391 --> 01:38:12.456
on your heads alone.

1835
01:38:12.457 --> 01:38:14.513
Therefore. I say

1836
01:38:14.514 --> 01:38:16.024
to arms!

1837
01:38:16.025 --> 01:38:17.400
Sound every drum!

1838
01:38:17.401 --> 01:38:19.749
Rebuke and dread correction wait on us!

1839
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:22.269
We offered fair. yet now we'll set on you

1840
01:38:22.270 --> 01:38:26.079
and God befriend us. as our cause is just!

1841
01:38:26.080 --> 01:38:30.937
To arms. gentlemen. to
arms and steel yourselves!

1842
01:38:37.412 --> 01:38:39.074
Raugh!

1843
01:38:55.186 --> 01:38:56.258
It's close!

1844
01:38:57.601 --> 01:39:00.934
The doorway's close. we're almost there!

1845
01:39:06.659 --> 01:39:09.745
Hold up thy head.
vile Scot. or thou art like

1846
01:39:09.746 --> 01:39:11.289
never to hold it up again.

1847
01:39:11.290 --> 01:39:13.912
It is the Prince of Wales
that threatens thee!

1848
01:39:18.192 --> 01:39:19.405
The Douglas is pursued!

1849
01:39:19.406 --> 01:39:20.756
Nay. 'tis not him!

1850
01:39:20.757 --> 01:39:23.620
It is. I saw him
through the smoke. it is!

1851
01:39:23.621 --> 01:39:25.989
Our allies need our aid.
come. mount your horse!

1852
01:39:25.990 --> 01:39:29.319
Nay. where is Hal? Where
is the Prince of Wales?

1853
01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:31.959
I saw him even now! The Prince must die!

1854
01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:34.692
Your rivalry can wait.
they need our help!

1855
01:39:34.693 --> 01:39:36.850
Without it I am nothing!

1856
01:39:36.851 --> 01:39:40.131
Go. I'll stay. and if I
cannot find him I will come.

1857
01:39:41.223 --> 01:39:43.869
Hal!

1858
01:39:43.870 --> 01:39:44.703
This is it!

1859
01:39:44.704 --> 01:39:45.818
Get out of here!

1860
01:39:45.819 --> 01:39:47.446
We can't stay. it's too dangerous!

1861
01:39:47.447 --> 01:39:48.280
This is the spot!

1862
01:39:48.281 --> 01:39:49.969
- There's nothing here!
- Sam. we have to leave!

1863
01:39:49.970 --> 01:39:51.099
This is where the doorway will be!

1864
01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:52.869
Go to! I'll cut you down!

1865
01:39:52.870 --> 01:39:53.800
I say go to!

1866
01:39:53.801 --> 01:39:55.016
But this is where you die!

1867
01:39:55.017 --> 01:39:56.619
I know where I'm supposed to be!

1868
01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:59.135
Girl. I don't think you do!

1869
01:40:07.195 --> 01:40:08.949
We've made it.

1870
01:40:08.950 --> 01:40:10.117
We've made it!

1871
01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:15.421
Who are they?

1872
01:40:15.422 --> 01:40:16.663
People.

1873
01:40:17.975 --> 01:40:19.450
Real people!

1874
01:40:20.358 --> 01:40:21.579
Hi. I'm Sam.

1875
01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:22.544
What's your name?

1876
01:40:22.544 --> 01:40:23.377
Angie.

1877
01:40:23.378 --> 01:40:25.208
Angie! Hi Angie!

1878
01:40:25.209 --> 01:40:27.466
I'll see you on the other side. Angie!

1879
01:40:27.467 --> 01:40:28.549
Come on!

1880
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:30.902
I'm coming home!

1881
01:40:30.903 --> 01:40:32.846
Are you coming?

1882
01:40:32.847 --> 01:40:33.684
Where?

1883
01:40:33.685 --> 01:40:35.044
Out.

1884
01:40:35.045 --> 01:40:36.349
No!

1885
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:39.061
Why not? She did it.

1886
01:40:39.062 --> 01:40:42.189
My father. my uncle. Kate

1887
01:40:42.190 --> 01:40:43.989
my whole life is here.

1888
01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:46.700
It's just a performance.

1889
01:40:46.701 --> 01:40:51.087
Prince Hal. Prince Hal
is here. I have to...

1890
01:40:51.088 --> 01:40:53.386
It's just a performance.

1891
01:41:17.075 --> 01:41:18.740
It's your line.

1892
01:41:20.040 --> 01:41:23.366
If I mistake not.
thou art Harry Monmouth.

1893
01:41:23.367 --> 01:41:26.430
Thou speak'st as if
I would deny my name.

1894
01:41:26.431 --> 01:41:28.232
My name...

1895
01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:38.780
My name is Harry Hotspur!

1896
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:44.659
No. No no no. wait. please--

1897
01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:48.079
I am a son. I am a nephew

1898
01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:51.137
I... Am princely

1899
01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:53.487
I am mighty.

1900
01:41:53.488 --> 01:41:56.469
I am loved. And I am happy!

1901
01:41:56.470 --> 01:41:57.952
Nay. do not shake thy head

1902
01:41:57.953 --> 01:42:00.699
I say I am the happiest man on earth

1903
01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:03.553
for I have all that men could ever wish!

1904
01:42:04.690 --> 01:42:08.859
Go thou thy ways. foul thing.
and nevermore I beg thee

1905
01:42:08.860 --> 01:42:10.869
nevermore to visit me.

1906
01:42:10.870 --> 01:42:13.929
I say again I am the happiest man!

1907
01:42:13.930 --> 01:42:17.679
I'll find you. You look
out for me next time.

1908
01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:19.711
But we will go together. I will find you--

1909
01:42:19.712 --> 01:42:22.711
I
am the Prince of Wales

1910
01:42:22.712 --> 01:42:24.339
and think not. Percy

1911
01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:26.949
to share with me in glory any more.

1912
01:42:26.950 --> 01:42:30.189
Two stars keep not their
motion in one sphere

1913
01:42:30.190 --> 01:42:32.889
nor can one England brook a double reign

1914
01:42:32.890 --> 01:42:35.671
of Harry Hotspur and the Prince of Wales.

1915
01:42:35.672 --> 01:42:38.528
Nor shall it. Harry;
for the hour is come

1916
01:42:38.529 --> 01:42:41.290
to end the one of us; and would to God

1917
01:42:41.291 --> 01:42:44.452
thy name and glory were
now as great as mine.

1918
01:42:44.453 --> 01:42:47.122
I'll make it greater
ere I part from thee

1919
01:42:47.123 --> 01:42:49.509
and with the budding honours on thy crest

1920
01:42:49.510 --> 01:42:52.947
I'll crop. to make a garland for my head!

1921
01:43:08.061 --> 01:43:09.528
Raaaugh!

1922
01:43:22.856 --> 01:43:24.834
You have a speech now.

1923
01:43:27.095 --> 01:43:29.229
You're supposed to give a
beautiful speech about honour

1924
01:43:29.230 --> 01:43:31.171
and pride and death.

1925
01:43:32.762 --> 01:43:36.268
And then you go out nobly.
and I get to be magnanimous.

1926
01:43:58.167 --> 01:44:02.474
Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.

1927
01:44:02.475 --> 01:44:05.379
When that this body did contain a spirit

1928
01:44:05.380 --> 01:44:08.739
a kingdom for it was too small a bound.

1929
01:44:08.740 --> 01:44:10.473
But now

1930
01:44:12.740 --> 01:44:15.669
two paces of the vilest earth

1931
01:44:15.670 --> 01:44:19.276
is room enough: this
earth that bears it dead

1932
01:44:19.277 --> 01:44:23.381
bears not alive so stout a gentleman.

1933
01:44:26.380 --> 01:44:28.605
Well done. my boy.

1934
01:44:29.847 --> 01:44:33.013
I am proud of thee at last.

1935
01:45:07.885 --> 01:45:09.743
No. foolish thing--

1936
01:45:13.171 --> 01:45:15.020
Lay on--

1937
01:45:15.021 --> 01:45:17.329
Lay on ya wee and scrawny thing--

1938
01:45:42.928 --> 01:45:45.478
Do you not love me--

1939
01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:21.089
So shaken as we are. so wan with care

1940
01:46:21.090 --> 01:46:24.909
find we a time for frighted peace to pant

1941
01:46:24.910 --> 01:46:29.199
and breathe short-winded
accents of new broils

1942
01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:33.043
to be commenced in strands afar remote.

1943
01:46:33.940 --> 01:46:37.749
No more the thirsty entrance of this soil

1944
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:41.475
shall daub her lips with
her own children's blood.

1945
01:46:42.430 --> 01:46:46.839
Nor more shall trenching
war channel her fields

1946
01:46:46.840 --> 01:46:51.069
nor bruise her flowerets
with the armèd hoofs

1947
01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:55.449
of hostile paces: those opposèd eyes

1948
01:46:55.450 --> 01:46:57.939
which. like the meteors
of a troubled heaven

1949
01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:01.419
all of one nature. of one substance bred

1950
01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:03.759
did lately meet in the intestine shock

1951
01:47:03.760 --> 01:47:06.339
and furious close of civil butchery

1952
01:47:06.340 --> 01:47:11.340
shall now. in mutual well-beseeming ranks

1953
01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:15.197
march all one way

1954
01:47:15.198 --> 01:47:18.459
and be no more opposed

1955
01:47:18.460 --> 01:47:22.718
against acquaintance. kindred

1956
01:47:23.559 --> 01:47:25.059
and allies.

1957
01:47:27.970 --> 01:47:32.529
The edge of war. like
an ill-sheathèd knife

1958
01:47:32.530 --> 01:47:34.899
no more shall cut his master.

1959
01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:38.899
Therefore. friends. as far as to the

1960
01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:41.169
sepulchre of Christ

1961
01:47:41.170 --> 01:47:44.829
forthwith a power of English shall we levy

1962
01:47:44.830 --> 01:47:47.619
whose arms were moulded
in their mothers' wombs

1963
01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:51.627
to chase those pagans
from those holy fields.

1964
01:47:56.047 --> 01:48:00.429
But this our purpose now is 12 month old

1965
01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:03.493
and bootless 'tis to tell you we will go.

1966
01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:06.218
Therefore we meet not now.

1967
01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:13.954
Then let me hear from you.
most valued loyal friend

1968
01:48:13.955 --> 01:48:16.989
what yesternight our council did decree

1969
01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:19.389
in forwarding this dear expedience.

1970
01:48:19.390 --> 01:48:22.689
My liege. this haste was hot in question

1971
01:48:22.690 --> 01:48:25.119
and many limits of the charge set down

1972
01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:29.889
but yesternight: when
all athwart there came

1973
01:48:29.890 --> 01:48:33.064
a post from Scotland.
leaden with grave news.

1974
01:48:34.956 --> 01:48:39.796
Harry Hotspur. or so you call her

1975
01:48:39.797 --> 01:48:43.093
fought valiantly against
the Earl of Douglas.

1976
01:48:44.170 --> 01:48:47.960
Because war makes men of us

1977
01:48:47.961 --> 01:48:49.809
or so she'd been told

1978
01:48:49.810 --> 01:48:52.477
and her father loved her for it.

1979
01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:55.613
Raugh!

1980
01:49:06.147 --> 01:49:06.980
Raugh!

1981
01:49:07.975 --> 01:49:08.808
Lay on!

1982
01:49:09.850 --> 01:49:12.347
Lay on ya wee and scrawny thing

1983
01:49:12.348 --> 01:49:15.806
I've fought grandmothers
with more strength than ye!

1984
01:49:18.416 --> 01:49:19.915
Raugh!

1985
01:49:23.904 --> 01:49:25.204
Raugh!

1986
01:49:31.272 --> 01:49:32.949
And she wasn't alone.

1987
01:49:32.950 --> 01:49:34.359
She had Prince Hal with her

1988
01:49:34.360 --> 01:49:36.519
who had trudged all the way from London

1989
01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:39.159
to see if he could kill a part of himself

1990
01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:41.993
as easily as Hotspur killed Scots.

1991
01:49:46.810 --> 01:49:49.800
Yea.
there thou makest me sad

1992
01:49:49.801 --> 01:49:51.975
and makest me sin in envy

1993
01:49:51.976 --> 01:49:54.009
that my Lord Northumberland

1994
01:49:54.010 --> 01:49:57.107
should be the father to so blest a child

1995
01:49:57.108 --> 01:49:57.941
a...

1996
01:50:00.174 --> 01:50:01.424
daughter

1997
01:50:02.765 --> 01:50:06.065
who is the theme of honour's tongue.

1998
01:50:07.845 --> 01:50:10.385
Whi-whi-whilst I. by
looking on the praise of...

1999
01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:16.050
see riot and dishonour stain
the brow of my young worry.

2000
01:50:17.350 --> 01:50:19.435
I mean Harry.

2001
01:50:21.503 --> 01:50:22.336
I worry.

2002
01:50:23.631 --> 01:50:25.001
I don't want him to miss out

2003
01:50:25.002 --> 01:50:26.907
on everything I've set aside for him.

2004
01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:31.299
On your feet. Prince Hal.

2005
01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:35.163
- These wars make men of us.
- Are you a man?

2006
01:50:36.370 --> 01:50:38.020
A spent one.

2007
01:50:39.970 --> 01:50:42.369
O
that it could be proved

2008
01:50:42.370 --> 01:50:45.039
that some night-tripping fairy

2009
01:50:45.040 --> 01:50:47.679
had exchanged Northumberland's
child with mine

2010
01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:49.059
when they were born

2011
01:50:49.060 --> 01:50:52.162
then would I have his Harry. and he mine.

2012
01:50:52.163 --> 01:50:53.635
I don't mean that.

2013
01:50:57.492 --> 01:51:01.834
My boy. I don't mean that.

2014
01:51:03.225 --> 01:51:05.628
Are you Northumberland or Henry?

2015
01:51:12.712 --> 01:51:13.837
I'm Dad?

2016
01:51:17.127 --> 01:51:18.285
I'm Dad!

2017
01:51:21.039 --> 01:51:22.587
Where are we?

2018
01:51:22.588 --> 01:51:23.421
Hi!

2019
01:51:24.715 --> 01:51:26.822
Do any of you recognise this?

2020
01:52:48.497 --> 01:52:49.622
Hey.

2021
01:52:49.623 --> 01:52:50.456
Hey. hey!

2022
01:52:53.756 --> 01:52:55.059
I'm really sorry I'm late.

2023
01:52:55.060 --> 01:52:57.489
The train it just decided
to stop in Hayward's Heath

2024
01:52:57.490 --> 01:53:00.601
for 15 minutes for
absolutely no fucking reason.

2025
01:53:00.602 --> 01:53:02.276
Bloody Thameslink. hey?

2026
01:53:03.820 --> 01:53:04.910
How are you?

2027
01:53:04.911 --> 01:53:06.893
I'm good. how are you-- oh! Oh.

2028
01:53:08.194 --> 01:53:09.932
You're looking well.

2029
01:53:09.933 --> 01:53:11.340
Yea-- thanks! Yeah.

2030
01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:15.526
Good to see you.

2031
01:53:16.731 --> 01:53:18.310
Could have picked a nicer day for it mind.

2032
01:53:18.311 --> 01:53:20.829
Yeah. yeah. the Boardwalk's
usually really nice in summer.

2033
01:53:20.830 --> 01:53:22.299
I guess the cold weather's
still clinging on.

2034
01:53:22.300 --> 01:53:24.477
Yeah. the weather those
couple of days last week though

2035
01:53:24.478 --> 01:53:27.781
when it was gorgeous. but yeah.
I guess winter's back now.

2036
01:53:27.782 --> 01:53:29.829
So you've been up to anything?

2037
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:31.599
Um. yeah. I'm all over.

2038
01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:32.566
I'm London based

2039
01:53:32.567 --> 01:53:35.076
but I've just got back
from Belize last week.

2040
01:53:35.917 --> 01:53:37.929
- Belize?
- Yeah!

2041
01:53:37.930 --> 01:53:40.989
It's gorgeous. I went on this
huge hike to this huge lake

2042
01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:43.089
called Five Blues. 'cause
it's got five rivers

2043
01:53:43.090 --> 01:53:45.369
running into it. and
then some howler monkeys

2044
01:53:45.370 --> 01:53:46.739
chucked poo at me.

2045
01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:50.289
I thought that was made up
but it turns out wild monkeys

2046
01:53:50.290 --> 01:53:52.179
actually really do throw shit at you.

2047
01:53:53.370 --> 01:53:56.658
It was fine! I just
washed it off in the lake.

2048
01:53:56.659 --> 01:53:57.999
Well. I don't think I could do that.

2049
01:53:58.000 --> 01:53:59.646
Where else have you been?

2050
01:53:59.647 --> 01:54:01.143
All over. um...

2051
01:54:01.144 --> 01:54:03.339
I did the Caribbean first.
as soon as I got out

2052
01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:04.839
and got my life together.

2053
01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:07.029
And I really needed some sun

2054
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:09.399
so I got a job on a cruise
ship. believe it or not!

2055
01:54:09.400 --> 01:54:10.240
Really?

2056
01:54:10.241 --> 01:54:14.019
Yeah! Really interesting people.

2057
01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:16.299
Quite a lot like us actually.

2058
01:54:16.300 --> 01:54:18.750
We had a little on-board community.

2059
01:54:19.810 --> 01:54:21.731
Yeah. there was this one girl from Glasgow

2060
01:54:21.732 --> 01:54:24.142
who'd been stuck inside
"The Taming of the Shrew"

2061
01:54:25.360 --> 01:54:27.272
and this Dutch guy who'd
played Duke Frederick

2062
01:54:27.273 --> 01:54:28.571
in "As You Like It"

2063
01:54:28.572 --> 01:54:30.179
and um. oh!

2064
01:54:30.180 --> 01:54:33.171
One of the chefs had recently
escaped from a dimension

2065
01:54:33.172 --> 01:54:36.911
that was entirely "Phantom of the Opera."

2066
01:54:40.143 --> 01:54:41.409
Just "Phantom of the Opera?"

2067
01:54:41.410 --> 01:54:43.372
No "Cats" or "Jesus Christ Superstar" or--

2068
01:54:43.373 --> 01:54:44.979
Apparently not. no.

2069
01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:46.599
Apparently there's no interconnected

2070
01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:49.474
Lloyd-Weber-verse down
there. it's just "Phantom."

2071
01:54:52.568 --> 01:54:54.444
For 35 years.

2072
01:55:00.614 --> 01:55:02.229
What about you?

2073
01:55:02.230 --> 01:55:06.346
Oh yeah. I'm good. I'm
um. I'm directing a play.

2074
01:55:06.347 --> 01:55:08.709
Yeah. in Brighton. At the Brighton Fringe.

2075
01:55:08.710 --> 01:55:11.160
Yeah. yeah.

2076
01:55:12.048 --> 01:55:12.881
No.

2077
01:55:14.350 --> 01:55:16.008
No. sorry. That was a lie.

2078
01:55:19.300 --> 01:55:20.192
I just um...

2079
01:55:23.049 --> 01:55:24.049
I came here.

2080
01:55:25.690 --> 01:55:29.259
That's nice. Peaceful.

2081
01:55:29.260 --> 01:55:30.643
The seaside?

2082
01:55:35.230 --> 01:55:36.313
Yeah. it's tough.

2083
01:55:38.290 --> 01:55:42.173
It's like... Now what. y'know?

2084
01:55:46.736 --> 01:55:48.772
I'm really glad to see you again.

2085
01:55:49.697 --> 01:55:52.314
Thank you for reaching out.

2086
01:55:52.315 --> 01:55:53.739
Of course.

2087
01:55:53.740 --> 01:55:55.119
I mean. it's whatever.

2088
01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:58.027
You got out; I got out.
All's Well That Ends Well.

2089
01:55:59.890 --> 01:56:01.954
Do not talk to me like Shakespeare. Blegh!

2090
01:56:01.955 --> 01:56:03.212
Oh my god. sorry.

2091
01:56:03.213 --> 01:56:05.766
I genuinely didn't even
realise I was doing it.

2092
01:56:07.850 --> 01:56:09.724
I got you a present actually.

2093
01:56:11.290 --> 01:56:12.462
Turn around.

2094
01:56:25.993 --> 01:56:27.126
Ta-dah!

2095
01:56:32.284 --> 01:56:33.959
It came in handy.

2096
01:56:36.013 --> 01:56:38.303
It's not magic anymore.

2097
01:56:39.221 --> 01:56:41.913
I just thought it might look
cool on a shelf or something.

2098
01:56:47.398 --> 01:56:48.796
Well

2099
01:56:48.797 --> 01:56:50.316
thank you.

2100
01:56:50.317 --> 01:56:53.317
I'm meeting some old friends
for lunch. Do you wanna come?

2101
01:56:57.710 --> 01:56:59.742
I'd better get ready for work.

2102
01:56:59.743 --> 01:57:01.933
You sure? What time's your shift?

2103
01:57:02.787 --> 01:57:06.279
Um. it's not till this evening but um...

2104
01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:09.722
I've still got some stuff
to sort out in the flat. so.

2105
01:57:09.723 --> 01:57:10.698
Okay.

2106
01:57:10.699 --> 01:57:11.955
Yeah.

2107
01:57:11.956 --> 01:57:13.419
Well. good to see you. yeah?

2108
01:57:13.420 --> 01:57:14.253
Oh yeah.

2109
01:57:14.254 --> 01:57:15.339
I-I'll message you sometime

2110
01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:16.801
maybe next time you're in Brighton.

2111
01:57:16.802 --> 01:57:18.018
Okay. Yeah.

2112
01:57:18.877 --> 01:57:19.710
Yeah!

2113
01:57:36.390 --> 01:57:38.006
You take it easy. yeah?

2114
01:57:51.676 --> 01:57:52.509
Hey.

2115
01:57:53.647 --> 01:57:56.014
Hey gorgeous!

2116
01:58:01.696 --> 01:58:02.948
You're looking good. girl!

2117
01:58:02.949 --> 01:58:03.987
Thank you!

2118
01:58:03.988 --> 01:58:04.929
Where's the others?

2119
01:58:04.930 --> 01:58:07.860
They're just catching up. Is Sam coming?

2120
01:58:07.861 --> 01:58:08.771
Uh. no. I don't--

2121
01:58:13.327 --> 01:58:14.651
Oh. is she in?

2122
01:58:15.915 --> 01:58:17.182
Oh. no.

2123
01:58:17.183 --> 01:58:18.579
Did you give her the map back?

2124
01:58:18.580 --> 01:58:21.973
Yeah. I um... I invited
her to come with us.

2125
01:58:23.380 --> 01:58:26.307
It does take some people
a little bit longer.

2126
01:58:26.308 --> 01:58:27.999
Remember what Dad was like?

2127
01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.656
It's not your fault. You offered.

2128
01:58:32.770 --> 01:58:37.770
It is hard to get used to
playing a new role. as it were.

2129
01:58:38.140 --> 01:58:42.403
That's life though. isn't
it; that's everything.

2130
01:58:48.472 --> 01:58:50.904
All the world's a stage.
