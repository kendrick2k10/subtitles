- Okay.

- (phone vibrating)

- There we go.

the secret about the reviewer!

440
00:21:35.333 --> 00:21:37.400
Yeah. we made a deal to
keep it a secret.

441
00:21:37.533 --> 00:21:40.967
but now that I told you. now you
kinda have to keep it a secret.

442
00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.967
- Oh. of course.
- Okay. great.

443
00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.166

444
00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:48.567

Just be careful.
Connie. you start running--

448
00:21:56.367 --> 00:21:58.166
Phoebe: It's so cute that you
guys already share a secret.

449
00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.667

451
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.800
Oh no! No. no!
No. no. no. no. no.

452
00:22:04.934 --> 00:22:06.367
I am so sorry.

453
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.400
Oh. it's-- it's okay.
I'll take care of this.

454
00:22:09.533 --> 00:22:12.066
Let me help. I mean. I can carry
it in or help salvage it.

455
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.533
Maybe I can...
I can make cupcakes.

456
00:22:13.667 --> 00:22:14.900
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

457
00:22:15.033 --> 00:22:16.467
Are you sure?

458
00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:18.400
Brigitte: Oh. I'll just
take this inside.

459
00:22:22.233 --> 00:22:23.633
(sighing)

460
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.400
I hope that cake wasn't for
anything special.

461
00:22:28.533 --> 00:22:31.567
Hey. accidents happen. okay?
It was just an accident.

462
00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:33.066
Don't beat yourself up.

463
00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:35.867
I bet Ben isn't too happy
with me now.

464
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.367
Let's go get a hot chocolate.

465
00:22:49.834 --> 00:22:51.567
Ben: No chance of
a last minute delivery?

466
00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:53.467
Brigitte: There was nothing
we could do to salvage it.

467
00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:55.467
So we'll just have to
alter the menu.

468
00:22:55.600 --> 00:22:58.400
Ben: Chagnon was expecting an
authentic Nordic menu.

469
00:22:58.533 --> 00:23:00.433
This Kransekake was a huge
part of that.

470
00:23:00.567 --> 00:23:02.533
Well. I could have the chef
whip up a pudding.

471
00:23:02.667 --> 00:23:04.433
but that's all we could manage
on such short notice.

472
00:23:04.567 --> 00:23:05.667
- Hi.
- Pudding?

473
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.633
Uh. I'm sorry I couldn't help
but overhear.

474
00:23:08.767 --> 00:23:10.166
What happened to the cake
was my fault.

475
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.133
so I would love to do anything
I could to help.

476
00:23:12.266 --> 00:23:14.100
I mean. I can't make another
Kransekake 'cause the dough

477
00:23:14.233 --> 00:23:16.333
needs to chill overnight.
but I can make any other kind

478
00:23:16.467 --> 00:23:18.533
- of Nordic dessert.
- Thank you. Ms. Fischer.

479
00:23:18.667 --> 00:23:20.467
But I'm sure we can handle
the situation.

480
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.367
Can we? I mean.
other than pudding.

481
00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:23.633
we don't have anything
else to offer.

482
00:23:23.767 --> 00:23:25.200
and pudding isn't
exactly Nordic.

483
00:23:25.333 --> 00:23:27.100
I can make an Aebleskiver.

484
00:23:27.233 --> 00:23:29.667
- Sorry. what did you say?
- It's a Nordic dessert.

485
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.633
My grandmother and I made it
growing up. I mean.

486
00:23:31.767 --> 00:23:34.200
I can make it in my sleep.
It's the least I could do.

487
00:23:34.333 --> 00:23:37.500
But you're our guest. we can't
have you cooking for us.

488
00:23:37.633 --> 00:23:40.367
Oh. trust me. this. like.
what you guys do.

489
00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.367
is exactly what I want
to be doing.

490
00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:46.600
So it would really just enhance
this whole experience for me.

491
00:23:46.734 --> 00:23:48.433
I mean. plus I know how
important

492
00:23:48.567 --> 00:23:50.333
this dinner is for you.

493
00:23:50.467 --> 00:23:52.500
Hannah. I think that's
a great idea.

494
00:23:52.633 --> 00:23:54.800
Uh. Aebleskiver it is. then.

495
00:23:54.934 --> 00:23:56.033
- Great.
- Okay.

496
00:23:56.166 --> 00:23:59.800
Cool. Okay.
I'm gonna get this to go.

497
00:23:59.934 --> 00:24:01.900
- Okay.
- Are you sure about this?

498
00:24:02.033 --> 00:24:03.867
She's here on behalf of
a travel agency.

499
00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:05.934
Yes. I know that.
but I'd rather not risk

500
00:24:06.066 --> 00:24:07.533
a negative review from Chagnon.

501
00:24:07.667 --> 00:24:09.367
and right now we don't have a
better option. so....

502
00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.400
Okay. ready.

503
00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:13.000
Great. I'll show you
the kitchen.

504
00:24:13.133 --> 00:24:14.734
- Cool.
- We got this.

505
00:24:14.867 --> 00:24:16.834
Thank you. Brigitte.

506
00:24:16.967 --> 00:24:18.433
- Right this way.
- Cool.

507
00:24:18.567 --> 00:24:20.066
- Go ahead.
- Oh.

508
00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.934
Ah. what did you say
it was called?

509
00:24:22.066 --> 00:24:23.533
Aebleskiver.

510
00:24:27.166 --> 00:24:30.066
Okay. so we usually source out
most of our desserts.

511
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.867
since as you can see. we don't
have a very large kitchen.

512
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.700
but I think we should have
everything we need.

513
00:24:34.834 --> 00:24:36.734
I did know you were helping me.

514
00:24:36.867 --> 00:24:38.700
Of course I am! I can't have you
telling your clients

515
00:24:38.834 --> 00:24:40.433
that at the Ice Hotel.

516
00:24:40.567 --> 00:24:42.100
they make the guests cook
their own meals.

517
00:24:42.233 --> 00:24:44.567
So what do we need?

518
00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:48.567
Okay. I need the cake pop pan.
eggs. butter. and milk.

519
00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:50.500
Got it. okay.

520
00:24:53.233 --> 00:24:56.400
So how did your family start
designing ice hotels?

521
00:24:56.533 --> 00:24:59.066
Well. um. when I was a kid.

522
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.600
I asked my dad for an igloo.

523
00:25:01.734 --> 00:25:04.600
and he recruited our family
friend. Joe Shawinigan.

524
00:25:04.734 --> 00:25:07.967
who is also a resident artist
here. actually.

525
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.934
He's the one that showed my dad
how to pack the snow

526
00:25:12.066 --> 00:25:15.266
so tight that it would actually
trap our body heat.

527
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:17.433
My dad and I spent the night
in the igloo.

528
00:25:17.567 --> 00:25:19.934
and the idea for the Ice Hotel
was born.

529
00:25:20.066 --> 00:25:21.767
That's a nice story.

530
00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:25.300
A lot of dreams are born from
great stories.

531
00:25:25.433 --> 00:25:28.300
What inspired you to enter into
the wild world

532
00:25:28.433 --> 00:25:31.066
of hospitality and hotel
management?

533
00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:33.233
- (Hannah laughing)
- It's a family tradition.

534
00:25:33.367 --> 00:25:36.166
Every year. my family goes on
a tropical vacation.

535
00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.834
- Really?
- Yeah. I loved it.

536
00:25:37.967 --> 00:25:41.233
Collecting seashells.
hearing the waves on the shore.

537
00:25:41.367 --> 00:25:44.667
And ever since then.
I wanted to manage my own hotel.

538
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.266
Somewhere warm.
You know. nothing fancy.

539
00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:49.266
just a couple huts on the ocean.

540
00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.400
- That's a good story.
- Mm. yeah.

541
00:25:51.533 --> 00:25:53.467
Wish it had a happy ending.
though. but...

542
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.000
What happened?

543
00:25:55.133 --> 00:25:59.166
Um. I was managing a hotel
for a little bit.

544
00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:03.400
but as it turns out.
it kind of flooded on my watch.

545
00:26:03.533 --> 00:26:05.300
So that's when I joined
the agency.

546
00:26:05.433 --> 00:26:07.066
and I've been there ever since.

547
00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.834
Here I am. fixing another
mistake.

548
00:26:11.467 --> 00:26:14.633
You know. the first Ice Hotel
that my dad and I tried to build

549
00:26:14.767 --> 00:26:16.734
started melting before we were
even finished.

550
00:26:16.867 --> 00:26:18.567
- Really?
- Yeah.

551
00:26:18.700 --> 00:26:20.066
It was a total disaster.

552
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.333
But we just kept the dream alive

553
00:26:22.467 --> 00:26:25.400
and kept trying until
we did it.

554
00:26:25.533 --> 00:26:28.500
Kind of like these eggs.
I'm really trying.

555
00:26:28.633 --> 00:26:30.467
but I think there might be some
shell in there.

556
00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.667
Okay. well. we can't have
Louis Chagnon

557
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.533
crunching on some egg shell.

558
00:26:34.667 --> 00:26:35.834
let's that out of there.
Okay.

559
00:26:35.967 --> 00:26:37.333

Where did you learn how
to do that?

626
00:30:13.767 --> 00:30:15.667
Well. I kinda just taught myself

627
00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.800
while sitting in my igloo.
actually.

628
00:30:17.934 --> 00:30:20.367
Um. I thought the place needed
a little sprucing up.

629
00:30:20.500 --> 00:30:23.300
so I just started etching little
designs into the ice.

630
00:30:23.433 --> 00:30:25.200
and just moved on to bigger
and bigger things.

631
00:30:25.333 --> 00:30:27.333
and now here we are.

632
00:30:27.467 --> 00:30:31.600

I know. Um. Phoebe can do it.

689
00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:17.900
I mean. she's a fitness
instructor.

690
00:33:18.033 --> 00:33:20.533
so she knows everything
sport-like.

691
00:33:20.667 --> 00:33:23.200
That's kind of you to offer her
services. Ms. Fischer.

692
00:33:23.333 --> 00:33:24.867
but we need two people to
take a group out.

693
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
One to lead. and one to
take up the rear

694
00:33:27.133 --> 00:33:28.367
and make sure no one
falls behind.

695
00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:29.734
Well. I can do it.

696
00:33:29.867 --> 00:33:31.233
Honestly. you've already
done enough.

697
00:33:31.367 --> 00:33:33.333
No. I would love to. and I'm
sure Phoebe would be on board.

698
00:33:33.467 --> 00:33:34.967
But you don't know the trails.

699
00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.367
and I doubt getting Louis
Chagnon lost would help us.

700
00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.633
Well. I can clear my schedule
and accompany them.

701
00:33:39.767 --> 00:33:42.133
Okay. well. I'll tell Phoebe
she's instructing today.

702
00:33:42.266 --> 00:33:43.900
- Great.
- Okay.

703
00:33:44.033 --> 00:33:45.200
Okay.

704
00:33:45.333 --> 00:33:48.133
- I have to--
- I know what you're gonna say.

705
00:33:48.266 --> 00:33:50.300
Look. she's so much more than
just a travel agent.

706
00:33:50.433 --> 00:33:51.867
She has dreams
of owning her own hotel.

707
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.500
Really?

708
00:33:53.633 --> 00:33:55.367
And I think she has some really
great problem solving skills.

709
00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.734
So don't worry.
We'll handle it.

710
00:33:57.867 --> 00:33:59.300
Mm-hm.

711
00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:10.633
Knock-knock.

712
00:34:10.767 --> 00:34:12.567
Oh my goodness. Hannah!

713
00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:14.233
I was just about to come and
find you. Guess what?

714
00:34:14.367 --> 00:34:15.467
What? What's up?

715
00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:17.800
Shawn is coming here.
To the hotel. to see me!

716
00:34:17.934 --> 00:34:20.533
Oh. that is great!
I mean--

717
00:34:20.667 --> 00:34:22.300
wait. what does that mean?

718
00:34:22.433 --> 00:34:25.367
It means he's finally proving
his commitment to me.

719
00:34:25.500 --> 00:34:26.533
Phoebe. I'm so happy for you.

720
00:34:26.667 --> 00:34:28.066
- Really.
- Thank you.

721
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:31.567
And don't worry. I won't make
you feel like a third wheel.

722
00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.233
Hey. especially if Ben hangs
out with us.

723
00:34:34.367 --> 00:34:36.266
Then we could. like. you know.
double date.

724
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:39.567
I really don't think Ben has
time to hang out.

725
00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:42.233
Besides. I kind of. um. messed
something up again.

726
00:34:42.367 --> 00:34:43.934
but that's okay 'cause we're
gonna fix it.

727
00:34:44.066 --> 00:34:46.700
We? What do you mean. "we?"

728
00:34:46.834 --> 00:34:48.367
Snowshoeing?

729
00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:49.800
Oh. seriously? That's fun.

730
00:34:49.934 --> 00:34:51.600
I mean. I've always wanted
to try it.

731
00:34:51.734 --> 00:34:53.200
- You've never tried it?
- No.

732
00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:54.900
but I hear it's challenging
which is very good.

733
00:34:55.033 --> 00:34:57.967
because I haven't had a proper
workout since we arrived.

734
00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.734
Oh no...

735
00:34:59.867 --> 00:35:01.333
Why. what?

736
00:35:01.467 --> 00:35:04.867
I kinda signed you up to. uh.
lead a snowshoeing tour.

737
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.500
Why?!

738
00:35:06.633 --> 00:35:08.767
Because Ben was going to have to
cancel because his employees

739
00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:10.767
got held up by a snow storm.
and then. I. of course.

740
00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.600
told Chagnon that he should try
it. and if he can't.

741
00:35:13.734 --> 00:35:15.600
then he might give the hotel a
bad review. but that's okay.

742
00:35:15.734 --> 00:35:16.967
because we can learn how--

743
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:18.200
Hannah. I know you like
this guy.

744
00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:19.967
but it takes me awhile to plan
a cardio circuit

745
00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:22.166
and I don't even know how
to snowshoe.

746
00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.467
I feel like if I can get this
hotel a good review.

747
00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:26.367
then I'm kinda like.

748
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.900
redeeming myself for flooding
the other one.

749
00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:33.367
- Is that crazy?
- It's not crazy.

750
00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:34.934
And besides. how hard can it be.

751
00:35:35.066 --> 00:35:36.800
I mean. we already know how to
cross country ski. right?

752
00:35:36.934 --> 00:35:38.700
- Thanks. you're the best.
- I know.

753
00:35:38.834 --> 00:35:40.433
(giggling)

754
00:35:40.567 --> 00:35:42.967
Okay. let's see how
this thing is done.

755
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.100
Is snowshoeing one word or two?

756
00:35:45.233 --> 00:35:46.467
Oh boy.

(cheering)

760
00:36:00.166 --> 00:36:02.867
Great. guys! Now your strides
should be a little bit

761
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.100
wider than normal. let's say.
if you were hiking.

Mm-hm.

764
00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:12.700
And make sure to keep your feet
firmly in the snow.

765
00:36:12.834 --> 00:36:15.266
You're gonna need the traction
from your snowshoe cleats

766
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.667
and your poles for traction.
okay. guys?

767

Pick up the pace! Keep it going!

At this pace it will tire
everyone out

before we're halfway through.

781
00:36:57.667 --> 00:37:00.567
I know. I know how we can slow
down the pace.

782
00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:02.600
Okay. everybody stop.

783
00:37:02.734 --> 00:37:06.734
If we all look to the right.
we can see. um.

784
00:37:06.867 --> 00:37:10.934
beautiful view of. um...

785
00:37:11.066 --> 00:37:15.567
Boreal forests. Yes. filled
primarily with pine.

786
00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:18.166
spruce. and larch.

787
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:22.834
This is no doubt. uh. an
integral part of the landscape.

788
00:37:22.967 --> 00:37:25.066
Ben:
Yes. indeed it is.

789
00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.433
Because of our long.
cold. climate.

790
00:37:28.567 --> 00:37:31.467
it means we have a very short
growing period.

791
00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:35.467
so the forests provide
a haven of survival

792
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.800
for many different species of
vegetation and wildlife.

793
00:37:39.934 --> 00:37:43.100
Now as we continue. we're gonna
be stopping from here and there

794
00:37:43.233 --> 00:37:46.333
to talk about. uh.

795
00:37:46.467 --> 00:37:48.600
facts about the region.

796
00:37:48.734 --> 00:37:52.967
- Won't we?
- Yes. yes we will.

797
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.200
- You are good!
- Hannah: Thank you.

798
00:38:03.233 --> 00:38:05.567
Ben: Now these forests will
actually yield

799
00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.800
quite an impressive variety of
berries year round.

800
00:38:08.934 --> 00:38:11.266
Hannah: Like the cloud berries
you use in the tea at the hotel?

801
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.367
Ben:
That's right.

802
00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.400
Yes. in the springtime.

803
00:38:15.533 --> 00:38:19.934
wild blueberries. cloud berries.
and goose berries

804
00:38:20.066 --> 00:38:23.467
will cover these grounds in
a cornucopia of color.

805
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.033
- What is it?
- The trail.

806
00:38:27.166 --> 00:38:28.900
it hasn't been cleared
through here.

807
00:38:29.033 --> 00:38:30.467
What does that mean?

808
00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.967
It means I can't exactly be sure
where we're going.

809
00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.567
(whispering)
Are you saying we're lost?

810
00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:39.400
This is very intriguing.
but I must say.

811
00:38:39.533 --> 00:38:42.900
the thought of a hot tea
right now is most appealing.

812
00:38:43.033 --> 00:38:44.567
- Yes.
- Phoebe: Yeah. guys.

813
00:38:44.700 --> 00:38:47.934
How long is this tour?
Or like. snowshoe. whatever.

814
00:38:48.066 --> 00:38:50.033
(Whispering) I'd say we'd have
looped around already.

815
00:38:50.166 --> 00:38:51.567
but I don't remember the
turnabout.

816
00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:53.100
I think we should get Chagnon
off his feet.

817
00:38:53.233 --> 00:38:55.567
'cause I can't tell if he's red
from the cold or the exertion.

818
00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.533
Okay. um. maybe I could try to
find us on the GPS.

819
00:38:59.667 --> 00:39:02.000
Oh. don't bother. there's no
signal. I already tried.

820
00:39:02.133 --> 00:39:03.533
Hannah:
It's okay.

821
00:39:03.667 --> 00:39:06.700
we're just going to follow our
tracks back to the hotel.

822
00:39:06.834 --> 00:39:09.533
All right. everybody!
Time to go back. whoo!

823
00:39:09.667 --> 00:39:11.000

Yay...

00:39:11.133 --> 00:39:12.600
Louis:
Okay.

825
00:39:23.066 --> 00:39:24.433
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah.

826
00:39:24.567 --> 00:39:25.834
Looks like we're not the only
ones taking advantage

827
00:39:25.967 --> 00:39:27.367
of the fresh snow.

828
00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:31.100
That house over there.

829
00:39:31.233 --> 00:39:32.700
Maybe someone's home.
we could ask for directions.

830
00:39:32.834 --> 00:39:34.700
Yeah. good idea.
I'll go check it out.

831
00:39:34.834 --> 00:39:36.233
Okay.

832
00:39:38.433 --> 00:39:40.300
Right this way. folks.

Ah--

835
00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:00.800
My goodness.
what do we have here?

836
00:40:00.934 --> 00:40:04.767
Hi. sorry for the intrusion.
we're from the Ice Hotel and--

837
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.333
(whispering)
We're a bit lost.

838
00:40:06.467 --> 00:40:09.133
Ah. the famed ice hotel.
come on in.

839
00:40:09.266 --> 00:40:10.367
- Come in.
- All of us?

840
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:11.800
Of course. you've come
a long way.

841
00:40:11.934 --> 00:40:14.166
All of you need to warm up
before we set you

842
00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.133
- in the right direction.
- Come on.

843
00:40:18.767 --> 00:40:20.266
Come along. folks.

844
00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.834
Some hot gooseberry tea to get
the chill out of your bones.

845
00:40:26.967 --> 00:40:28.867
Thank you.

846
00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.333
I must say.

847
00:40:30.467 --> 00:40:34.000
this is the most enjoyable
part of the tour.

848
00:40:34.133 --> 00:40:36.100
We kinda told the guests
that this was part

849
00:40:36.233 --> 00:40:37.934
of the whole snowshoeing tour.

850
00:40:38.066 --> 00:40:40.133
Yeah. so they don't know
we're lost.

851
00:40:40.266 --> 00:40:42.967
Don't worry. you haven't strayed
too far off the beaten path.

852
00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.600
Yeah. we'll point you in
the right way

853
00:40:44.734 --> 00:40:45.967
after you've all had a rest.

854
00:40:46.100 --> 00:40:48.600
Thank you so much for your
hospitality. both of you.

855
00:40:48.734 --> 00:40:51.000
Well. the Ice Hotel was more
than hospitable to us

856
00:40:51.133 --> 00:40:54.333
when we stayed there on our 20th
wedding anniversary.

857
00:40:54.467 --> 00:40:58.200
Oh. it was magical. I even
remember the room we stayed in.

858
00:40:58.333 --> 00:41:00.266
It had a snow owl theme.

859

Oh. my father designed
that room.

860
00:41:01.667 --> 00:41:03.200
Your father. really?!

861
00:41:03.333 --> 00:41:06.233
Yeah. so this is my first year
designing the hotel by myself

862
00:41:06.367 --> 00:41:09.667
but my father is the real
creative force behind it

863
00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:11.600
and has been for the last
22 years.

864
00:41:11.734 --> 00:41:13.734

Anyway. come over here.
I want to show you this.

1049

Okay. this right here
is called a spile.

1050
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.800
It's just a tap that allows the
sap to run into the bucket.

almost full.

Okay. (clears throat)

1069
00:50:30.467 --> 00:50:33.834
This is the part where the sap.
which runs from the trees

1070
00:50:33.967 --> 00:50:36.900
is boiled down so the water
evaporates.

1071
00:50:37.033 --> 00:50:40.433
and what's left is what we like
to call liquid gold.

1072
00:50:40.567 --> 00:50:41.667
That's right.

1073
00:50:41.800 --> 00:50:43.333
So. it actually takes

1074
00:50:43.467 --> 00:50:46.667
about 40 to 50 gallons of sap to
make just one gallon of syrup.

1075
00:50:46.800 --> 00:50:49.100
So. it really is just as
precious as gold.

1076

00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:32.734
is cut down the general size
of what you want to make.

1157

the chainsaw.

1168
00:56:05.367 --> 00:56:06.734
is that when you stopped
pursuing your dream

1169
00:56:06.867 --> 00:56:08.133
of running your own hotel?

1170
00:56:08.266 --> 00:56:11.400

the kind of job you get right
out of college.

1174
00:56:19.266 --> 00:56:21.734

1175
00:56:21.867 --> 00:56:24.300

I was working late

1176
00:56:24.433 --> 00:56:26.266

about a leak

1177
00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:29.467

the next morning.

1178

Clearly I was wrong. so. yeah
an inch of water later.

1179
00:56:33.567 --> 00:56:36.266
I was fired. and that's when I
started working at the agency.

1180
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:37.800
You know.

1181
00:56:37.934 --> 00:56:41.734
kind of hard to mess up an eight
by eight cubicle. right? Heh.

1182
00:56:41.867 --> 00:56:45.533
I can imagine why that would
make you question yourself.

1183
00:56:45.667 --> 00:56:47.900
but take it from somebody who
has been through

1184
00:56:48.033 --> 00:56:50.433
a lot of ups and downs
in this business.

1185
00:56:50.567 --> 00:56:53.600
you have more than what it takes
to run a place like this.

1186
00:56:53.734 --> 00:56:57.100
And I think it would
be a shame

1187
00:56:57.233 --> 00:56:59.433
if you gave up
on your dreams.

1188
00:56:59.567 --> 00:57:02.934

what have we got?

1189
00:57:04.266 --> 00:57:05.467
Hmm.

1190
00:57:07.300 --> 00:57:08.867

we're done with this.

1191
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000

entrance.

00:57:22.467 --> 00:57:24.467
Ben: Look at you go.

1198
00:57:26.233 --> 00:57:27.266
I think it looks good here.

1199
00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.266
I agree.
I think it's perfect.

1200
00:57:29.400 --> 00:57:31.867
Almost perfect.

1201
00:57:38.567 --> 00:57:40.500
There. Now it's perfect.

1202
00:57:40.633 --> 00:57:43.033
Oh yeah. Good job.

1203
00:57:43.166 --> 00:57:46.200
Hey. Nice shell.

1204
00:57:46.333 --> 00:57:47.633
- It's a clam.
- With a pearl.

1205
00:57:47.767 --> 00:57:50.033
- Ben and I made it.
- Seriously?

1206
00:57:50.166 --> 00:57:52.867
Yeah. she's a quick study
this one.

1207

Hey there. I'm Ben Wade.

1208

Oh. I'm sorry.
Ben. this is my--

very nice to meet you.

1211

I'm thrilled you
could make it.

1212
00:58:01.967 --> 00:58:04.266
Ben is the designer
of all of this.

1213
00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.066
Wow. Well. from what
I've seen so far.

1214
00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:07.734
congratulations are in order.

1215
00:58:07.867 --> 00:58:09.333
Thank you so much.

1216
00:58:09.467 --> 00:58:11.333
Hey. we were just on our way to
make a dinner reservation

1217
00:58:11.467 --> 00:58:13.834
for the three of us. but I could
make it for four.

1218
00:58:13.967 --> 00:58:15.367
if you can join us. Ben.

1219
00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:18.433
(chuckling) Um. you know what?

1220
00:58:18.567 --> 00:58:20.567
I do deserve a break.
actually.

1221
00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:22.400
And I'm pretty staffed
at the moment.

1222
00:58:22.533 --> 00:58:24.700
and I'm. well. kind of
the boss of the place.

1223
00:58:24.834 --> 00:58:26.033
So. uh. yeah okay.

1224
00:58:26.166 --> 00:58:27.934
Well. then. hey you should take
the day off

1225
00:58:28.066 --> 00:58:29.600
and you two could
play hooky together.

1226
00:58:29.734 --> 00:58:31.667
I don't think it's the time
to do that. so...

1227
00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:34.166
I think that sounds
like a great idea.

1228
00:58:34.300 --> 00:58:35.834
I'll just go arrange for
the shuttle

1229
00:58:35.967 --> 00:58:37.533
to pick us up for dinner
and I'll be back.

1230

Of course he does.
We all deserve a break.

1239
00:58:56.667 --> 00:58:58.266
Well. we've already done
a tour on foot.

1240
00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.400
and I don't think if we got
lost again

1241
00:59:00.533 --> 00:59:02.433
we'd have the same luck
we did last time.

1242
00:59:02.567 --> 00:59:04.900
So. maybe a different kind of
tour is in order.

- Ben: Isn't he?

1247
00:59:16.734 --> 00:59:19.800
We call him Bear because
he's soft as a teddy.

1248
00:59:19.934 --> 00:59:22.000
but big as a grizzly.
Aren't you. boy?

1249
00:59:22.133 --> 00:59:23.500
This is gonna be easier than
snowshoeing.

Yeah. warmer too.

with around here.

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.800
that what you're seeing there

1368
01:05:13.934 --> 01:05:15.533
are people's
spirits crossing over.

1369
01:05:15.667 --> 01:05:19.700
They're dancing into the next
life. the next adventure.

1370
01:05:19.834 --> 01:05:22.133
My grandmother said
that the Nordic believed

1371
01:05:22.266 --> 01:05:25.467
that the Aurora was a
premonition of good news.

1372
01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:27.567
I like that.

1373
01:05:30.266 --> 01:05:31.600
(chuckling)

1374
01:05:31.734 --> 01:05:34.300
I think I'm gonna go check
on those sculptures now.

1375
01:05:34.433 --> 01:05:35.767
You two enjoy your evening.

1376
01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:37.200
It was a pleasure
meeting you. Joe.

1377
01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:40.133
You. too.
And I'll see you around.

1378

Take care.

1379
01:05:44.467 --> 01:05:47.166
It's amazing.

1380
01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:48.834
This whole trip.
it's just like you said.

1381
01:05:48.967 --> 01:05:50.667
I'm gonna have memories
I'm never gonna forget.

1382
01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:52.967
All too often. when we
return to our normal lives.

1383
01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:54.633
we do forget what it was like.

1384
01:05:54.767 --> 01:05:57.333
I think I know a way
we can make people remember.

1385
01:05:57.467 --> 01:06:00.500
You. an idea?
Why am I not surprised?

1386
01:06:00.633 --> 01:06:02.033
I have to make a call.

1387
01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:03.834
Can you meet me
here in the morning?

1388
01:06:03.967 --> 01:06:05.333
It's a date.

1389
01:06:05.467 --> 01:06:07.533
Thanks for playing
hooky with me today.

1390
01:06:07.667 --> 01:06:09.834
I had a great time.

1391
01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:11.767
Goodnight. Hannah.

1392

1395
01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.734
Wow.

1396
01:06:26.867 --> 01:06:29.667
That's incredible.
It looks just like ice.

1397
01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.734
And it won't melt. so your
guests can take the wonders

1398
01:06:32.867 --> 01:06:34.467
of the ice hotel home with them.

1399
01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:35.900
That's a great idea.

1400
01:06:36.033 --> 01:06:37.900
Hey. Phil. if I commissioned
you.

1401
01:06:38.033 --> 01:06:39.300
would you be able
to make one of these

1402
01:06:39.433 --> 01:06:40.633
for each of the guests
to take home with them?

1403
01:06:40.767 --> 01:06:42.233
Alice and I would be
honored to.

1404
01:06:42.367 --> 01:06:43.600
You know what? You take this one

1405
01:06:43.734 --> 01:06:45.166
and we'll have that
order done when you need it.

1406
01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:48.066
I know. We should
give one to Louis Chagnon.

1407
01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.900
Might inspire his review.

1408
01:06:50.033 --> 01:06:52.133
You're right about this one;
she's full of ideas.

1409
01:06:52.266 --> 01:06:53.500
- See ya.
- Thanks for everything.

1410
01:06:53.633 --> 01:06:54.767

Where's the door to this thing?

1510
01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.367
Oh. no. Please.
We don't let the guests do that.

1511
01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.200
Otherwise. we run the risk of
the doors being left open.

1512
01:11:29.333 --> 01:11:30.767
and if too much heat escapes.

1513
01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.767
well. it could quite literally
melt and flood this room.

1514
01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:38.734
You see. running an
ice hotel is delicate work

1515
01:11:38.867 --> 01:11:41.233
and requires
someone like myself.

1516
01:11:41.367 --> 01:11:44.533
who understands the fragile
nature of ice and snow.

1517
01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:46.367
which is very important

1518
01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.200
because the slightest
misstep or wrong decision

1519
01:11:48.333 --> 01:11:50.900
or even just an accident

1520
01:11:51.033 --> 01:11:53.767
could turn this place
into a watery mess.

1521
01:11:53.900 --> 01:11:57.567

Ben to entrust his life's work
