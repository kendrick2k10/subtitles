We're gonna beat you up.

Leave me alone. please!

10
00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.250

00:01:23.791 --> 00:01:26.333
-No! No!
-Keep going. Keep going.

12
00:01:26.416 --> 00:01:29.166
-Come on. Hurry.
-Easy. Stay right here.

13
00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.208
-Take his glasses off.
-Let me see those glasses.

14
00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:35.041
I don't think
you're gonna need them anymore. huh?

15
00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:37.000
Throw him in.

16
00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.750
Please! No!

17
00:01:43.791 --> 00:01:45.791
-Come on. Pelofrito.
-Come on.

18
00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:48.916
Come here.
We'll give you a hand. Come.

19
00:01:52.208 --> 00:01:54.916
Come on. we gotta wash your hair.
It's dirty and gross.

20
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.916
-Help!
-Get out!

21
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.041
-Help!
-Come on. Get out!

22
00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:01.416
Are you seriously
shitting your pants right now?

23
00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:04.125
Come on. dude.
Otherwise. you're gonna drown!

24
00:02:07.291 --> 00:02:08.208
Pelofrito?

25
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:10.166
What are you doing?

26
00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:13.541
He's stopped moving.

27
00:02:14.541 --> 00:02:16.000
Hey. Pelofrito!

28
00:02:17.958 --> 00:02:19.250
Did we just kill him?!

29
00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:43.416
No. please don't. No. please don't.

30
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.750
<i>Throughout the centuries.</i>
<i>the most enigmatic legend of all</i>

31
00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:20.500
<i>is the legend of Azrael the Vampire.</i>

32
00:03:20.583 --> 00:03:25.208
<i>The first accounts of his existence</i>
<i>date back to the time of Jesus Christ.</i>

33
00:03:25.291 --> 00:03:28.250
<i>Ever since then.</i>
<i>Azrael appeared regularly over the years</i>

34
00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:32.041
<i>and became a mysterious creature</i>
<i>hiding in the shadows.</i>

35
00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:34.500
<i>An indestructible warrior.</i>

36
00:03:37.875 --> 00:03:39.875
<i>A scholar of all that can't be named.</i>

37
00:03:42.958 --> 00:03:44.666
<i>The leader of darkness.</i>

38
00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.083
<i>But once we entered the modern era</i>
<i>and suffered through two world wars.</i>

39
00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:57.125
<i>he suddenly vanished into thin air.</i>

40
00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:00.500
<i>The impact he had over hundreds of years</i>

41
00:04:00.583 --> 00:04:02.000
<i>went up in smoke.</i>

42
00:04:02.083 --> 00:04:04.666
<i>No witnesses still alive</i>
<i>to testify they saw him.</i>

43
00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.666
<i>Or to help locate</i>
<i>where this fascinating creature is hiding</i>

44
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.583
<i>until now…</i>

45
00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:27.500
<i>And I've found a lead</i>
<i>that might take me to him.</i>

46
00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:30.708
LIDIA
ARE YOU SURE?

47
00:04:32.708 --> 00:04:34.375
<i>You don't believe me?</i>

48
00:04:35.416 --> 00:04:37.916
I BELIEVE THAT YOU BELIEVE.
THAT'S ENOUGH.

49
00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:41.666
<i>Wow. Lidia.</i>
<i>I'm so glad I found you on this forum.</i>

50
00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:44.958
<i>Same here.</i>

51
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.583
<i>I can't wait to put a face</i>
<i>to your name.</i>

52
00:04:52.666 --> 00:04:54.458
<i>Yep. that'll be awesome.</i>

53
00:04:55.833 --> 00:04:58.791
<i>As I was saying.</i>
<i>I have a lead on Azrael the Vampire.</i>

54
00:04:59.708 --> 00:05:01.041
Javi?

55
00:05:01.958 --> 00:05:04.083
Could you warn me before coming in?
You're like a ninja.

56
00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:06.541
Son. I've told you three times
that dinner's ready.

57
00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:09.291
Come on. Wash your hands.
Who knows what you were up to.

58
00:05:09.375 --> 00:05:11.375
-I wasn't up to anything.
-I'm not judging you.

59
00:05:11.458 --> 00:05:14.041
If I was your age. my dick would look
like a monkey's butthole.

60
00:05:14.125 --> 00:05:16.458
-All red.
-I beg you to stop.

61
00:05:16.541 --> 00:05:18.791
I mean. nowadays.
everything is all messed up.

62
00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:21.291
Between the <i>hentai</i> porn comics. you know.

63
00:05:21.375 --> 00:05:22.500
and fast-fucking…

64
00:05:23.041 --> 00:05:24.041
Fist-fucking.

65
00:05:24.125 --> 00:05:26.416
-Where did you learn that?
-I don't know.

66
00:05:26.958 --> 00:05:29.791
I thought it was "fast"
because you wanna be done ASAP.

67
00:05:29.875 --> 00:05:32.500
To have someone put a fist up there.
all the way to your jugular.

68
00:05:32.583 --> 00:05:33.541
that's just nasty.

69
00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.291
Oh gosh. I thought it was "fast."

70
00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:39.958
In my teenage years.
we had those perfume commercials.

71
00:05:40.041 --> 00:05:41.416
They were all we needed.

72
00:05:41.916 --> 00:05:43.041
I trust you.

73
00:05:44.416 --> 00:05:45.583
What's for dinner?

74
00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:47.000
Well. something yummy.

75
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.500
Right. And easy to defrost.

76
00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:50.875
Yeah. Correct.

77
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.875
Oh man!

78
00:05:56.416 --> 00:05:57.833
"Lidia."

79
00:05:58.666 --> 00:06:02.250
Seriously? Goodness gracious.
What the heck is <i>that</i>?

80
00:06:05.875 --> 00:06:08.541
<i>We're back again</i>
<i>on my YouTube channel. guys.</i>

81
00:06:08.625 --> 00:06:09.666
<i>Putastakeinit.</i>

82
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:17.000
Vale.<i> maybe my last investigation</i>
<i>on shawarmas</i>

83
00:06:17.083 --> 00:06:20.708
<i>that potentially turn people into zombies</i>
<i>has caused me severe diarrhea.</i>

84
00:06:24.958 --> 00:06:27.500
<i>But this time.</i>
<i>I'm onto something really huge.</i>

85
00:06:28.166 --> 00:06:31.208
<i>A few years ago. several kids</i>
<i>went missing in my neighborhood.</i>

86
00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:35.208
They said some pervert had done it.
and case closed.

87
00:06:35.291 --> 00:06:36.208
<i>Ha!</i>

88
00:06:37.541 --> 00:06:39.000
Careful!

89
00:06:42.083 --> 00:06:45.375
A guy in my class disappeared
last weekend. His name was Borja.

90
00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:46.625
<i>Just a classic asshole.</i>

91
00:06:47.666 --> 00:06:50.958
<i>And they said</i>
<i>that the same pervert had done it.</i>

92
00:06:51.041 --> 00:06:52.916
Yet I'm actually convinced

93
00:06:53.666 --> 00:06:56.875
that the reason
why these kids disappeared like this.

94
00:06:56.958 --> 00:06:58.041
<i>has to be</i>

95
00:06:58.833 --> 00:06:59.833
<i>supernatural.</i>

96
00:07:01.416 --> 00:07:02.416
<i>A vampire.</i>

97
00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.208
Hang onto your hats now!

98
00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:08.125
Because I've discovered
that creature from darkness.

99
00:07:08.916 --> 00:07:12.541
<i>And now nothing will stand between</i>
<i>this hungry monster looking for blood</i>.

100
00:07:14.041 --> 00:07:15.625
<i>and me. </i>

101
00:07:19.791 --> 00:07:22.958
Well. except my mother.
who cleaned up my bedroom.

102
00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:27.541
Mommy! Where's the sharpener
I use for my stakes?

103
00:07:27.625 --> 00:07:29.708
In your drawer as usual!

104
00:07:29.791 --> 00:07:31.000
It's not in the drawer.

105
00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:32.958
Don't make me
come and find it for you!

106
00:07:36.208 --> 00:07:37.250
Followers. I'm serious.

107
00:07:37.875 --> 00:07:40.166
<i>If I die. remember…</i>

108
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:41.875
<i>I'm serious. remember.</i>

109
00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:45.500
<i>It'll be all my mom's fault 'cause</i>
<i>she's obsessed with cleaning my room!</i>

110
00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:13.666
Sister Learza! Sister Learza!

111
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:16.958
Here are the posters we did
for poor Borja.

112
00:08:17.041 --> 00:08:18.666
MISSING

113
00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:24.375
Uh. it's the only photo
we found on his Facebook.

114
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.166
I think you should try again.

115
00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:30.333
I hope he's all right and that this
deviant man isn't hurting him or anything.

116
00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:33.625
I'm sure he's a deviant.
He must be sodomizing our boy.

117
00:08:34.416 --> 00:08:36.708
I'm sure he'll come back to us
safe and sound.

118
00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.291
God would not allow any other outcome.

119
00:08:43.916 --> 00:08:45.666
Day after tomorrow.

120
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:48.291
we'll go inside the lab
and rescue those poor little creatures.

121
00:08:50.083 --> 00:08:52.000
Like Greta says.
"You act first and think later."

122
00:08:52.083 --> 00:08:53.416
She never said that.

123
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:55.625
Sara. I can't do this without you.

124
00:08:55.708 --> 00:08:56.916
You're coming for sure. right?

125
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.291
Otherwise. I'll tickle you! Huh? Huh? Huh?

126
00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:06.916
Stop it! That was my tit!

127
00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:28.625
Careful.

128
00:09:29.625 --> 00:09:31.375
Dude.

129
00:09:32.333 --> 00:09:34.541
Get outta the way. dude.
You loser!

130
00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:41.458
Hello. Sara.

131
00:09:41.541 --> 00:09:44.041
Have you thought it over? Wanna date me?

132
00:09:44.125 --> 00:09:45.416
You're not her type.

133
00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.375
Well. it didn't really seem that way
when we used to make out all those times.

134
00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:53.833
Manu. that was back in daycare.
And we were two years old.

135
00:09:53.916 --> 00:09:55.208
I know. but…

136
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.500
but I still remember that too.

137
00:09:58.166 --> 00:09:59.916
I'll try to explain again. asshole.

138
00:10:00.416 --> 00:10:02.125
Sara has nothing to do with a perv

139
00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:04.708
who sends photos
of his limp dick to all the girls.

140
00:10:05.833 --> 00:10:07.583
Sara-- Sara. that's not my photo!

141
00:10:07.666 --> 00:10:09.291
I-- I swear it's not. Sara!

142
00:10:10.458 --> 00:10:13.083
-Hey. what are you doing? Stop!
-Hey!

143
00:10:16.375 --> 00:10:18.416
You wanna hit a disabled girl?

144
00:10:18.916 --> 00:10:19.750
Come on.

145
00:10:20.416 --> 00:10:22.000
Go ahead. Make my day. dude.

146
00:10:22.083 --> 00:10:25.041
Dude. let's go. Come on.
You're not gonna hit a disabled girl.

147
00:10:25.125 --> 00:10:26.666
Come on. bro.

148
00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:34.291
Tss!

149
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:45.833
Dude!

150
00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:48.875
Guess what I hate most in this world?

151
00:10:48.958 --> 00:10:50.625
Hm. A loss by Real Madrid?

152
00:10:53.375 --> 00:10:55.833
Yes. And what's my number two?

153
00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
A win by Barcelona?

154
00:10:58.083 --> 00:10:59.250
And my number three?

155
00:10:59.333 --> 00:11:02.041
Don't answer-- You don't need
to answer 'cause I'll tell you.

156
00:11:02.666 --> 00:11:04.750
I just hate all those fat fucks like you.

157
00:11:04.833 --> 00:11:07.708
The reason why I'm obese
has to do with some bad genes I have.

158
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:11.875
And also the tortillas my mom makes.
They're so yummy. I gotta say.

159
00:11:11.958 --> 00:11:14.916
If you really wanna blame someone.
how 'bout you call her?

160
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.250
How about I choke you
with your fucking cellphone?!

161
00:11:18.333 --> 00:11:19.708
That's it. Get him!

162
00:11:19.791 --> 00:11:21.666
-Get off me!
-Fight. guys!

163
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:23.458
Come on! Let's go. man!

164
00:11:23.541 --> 00:11:25.583
Manu. stop it! Stop being such a butthole!

165
00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.833
If you beg me.
I'll stop right now. Sara.

166
00:11:28.916 --> 00:11:30.916
Come on!

167
00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.250
-Get off!
-Knock it off!

168
00:11:35.333 --> 00:11:36.458
Did you hear that?

169
00:11:39.291 --> 00:11:40.708
Looks like our new friend

170
00:11:41.208 --> 00:11:43.666
doesn't quite understand
how things work in here.

171
00:11:48.666 --> 00:11:52.375
I'm gonna make your life
fucking impossible. you fucking idiot.

172
00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.041
Let me remind you.

00:12:00.125 --> 00:12:02.041
that I am the only one in this high school

174
00:12:02.125 --> 00:12:05.208
who will ever make
anyone's life impossible. okay?

175
00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.333
Hello!

176
00:12:17.333 --> 00:12:18.375
You're Juan. right?

177
00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:20.833
Javi.

178
00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.083
Javi. Javi. Nice to meet you. I'm Sara.

179
00:12:24.166 --> 00:12:26.958
We haven't even met yet.
and we're halfway into the semester.

180
00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:30.666
Can I have it back?

181
00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:32.125
Huh?

182
00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:35.666
Oh. I'm sorry.

183
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:38.833
I like what you said about Diego.
No one else said anything.

184
00:12:38.916 --> 00:12:42.708
-No one really likes him. He's special.
-But you like him. correct?

185
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:44.333
Yeah.

186
00:12:44.416 --> 00:12:46.541
He and I like the same stuff.
I'm a little freaky.

187
00:12:46.625 --> 00:12:48.750
Oh. you mean
you're into vampires.

188
00:12:50.291 --> 00:12:51.541
How did you know that?

189
00:12:52.333 --> 00:12:53.833
Hey! Huh?

190
00:12:53.916 --> 00:12:56.625
Hey. loser! Yes. you. yeah.

191
00:12:56.708 --> 00:12:58.291
-Tss! Come over here.
-I gotta go.

192
00:12:58.375 --> 00:12:59.916
We need to talk. Come here! Hey!

193
00:13:01.833 --> 00:13:03.291
Go get him. guys! Go!

194
00:13:03.791 --> 00:13:05.708
-Dude!
-Only pussies run away!

195
00:13:05.791 --> 00:13:08.625
So. um. how 'bout
we go out for a drink tonight?

196
00:13:08.708 --> 00:13:09.708
No way.

AZRAEL NEW MESSAGE

198
00:13:24.083 --> 00:13:25.666
<i>I finally talked to him!</i>

199
00:13:26.166 --> 00:13:27.166
<i>To Javi?</i>

200
00:13:29.250 --> 00:13:30.083
Hm?

201
00:13:30.166 --> 00:13:31.000

00:13:33.666 --> 00:13:35.291
<i>No one. Keep going.</i>

203
00:13:36.791 --> 00:13:39.041

<i>Yes…</i>

205
00:13:41.708 --> 00:13:44.583

LIDIA OFFLINE

00:14:02.125 --> 00:14:04.541
<i>Dad. that's me.</i>
<i>You're not supposed to shoot at me.</i>

211
00:14:04.625 --> 00:14:07.416
This is really complicated.
It's just not for me.

212
00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.166
Oh man. Wow! This is harder than the army.

213
00:14:10.708 --> 00:14:11.791
Dad. throw a grenade.

214
00:14:11.875 --> 00:14:13.750
-What?
-Throw it.

215
00:14:13.833 --> 00:14:14.833
ELIMINATED

216
00:14:14.916 --> 00:14:16.041
Oh. he killed me before…

217
00:14:16.875 --> 00:14:17.791
That's great. huh?

218
00:14:17.875 --> 00:14:20.333
I love that we hang out together.
This is amazing.

219
00:14:22.291 --> 00:14:23.208
I guess so.

220
00:14:23.291 --> 00:14:25.875
That's for you.
I bought you a-- a new video game.

221
00:14:25.958 --> 00:14:28.250
Are you serious?
The one I mentioned the other day?

222
00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:32.291
Not the one you mentioned the other day.
However. I hope you like it.

223
00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:41.291
-I think they made a mistake at the store.
-No. son. No. They didn't mess up. No.

224
00:14:42.791 --> 00:14:46.791
"Be a princess and tame your unicorns."
What do you expect me to do with that?

225
00:14:47.708 --> 00:14:50.333
All right. listen. uh.
you're batting for the other team.

226
00:14:51.333 --> 00:14:52.458
-What?
-I'm sorry.

227
00:14:52.541 --> 00:14:55.083
You know. guys find this word offensive.
I. uh. um--

228
00:14:55.166 --> 00:14:56.916
I'm-- Uh. You're a fairy.

229
00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.500
Now we say "gay."

230
00:14:58.583 --> 00:15:00.750
And it wouldn't matter if I was.
But I'm not.

231
00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:04.375
Come on. well. then you're bi.
Just-- Just-- Just-- Bifidus. hm?

232
00:15:04.458 --> 00:15:07.500
Bi-transexual. bi-trans-gay.
and gay-curious?

233
00:15:07.583 --> 00:15:10.541
Sorry. I'm a little narrow-minded.
I mean. I grew up in the '80s.

234
00:15:11.125 --> 00:15:13.333
I can tell. What's wrong with you?

235
00:15:13.416 --> 00:15:16.625
Well. the other day.
I happened to see the web page where

236
00:15:16.708 --> 00:15:18.333
you were pretending to be Lidia.

237
00:15:18.416 --> 00:15:22.416
I saw all those naked guys without shirts.
and I thought. "He's something."

238
00:15:22.916 --> 00:15:24.041
It's not how it looks.

239
00:15:24.125 --> 00:15:28.041
It's no problem. son. It's no problem.
You won't give me any grandkids.

240
00:15:28.125 --> 00:15:31.125
but you'll adopt a Chinese kid.
and I'll love it just as much--

241
00:15:31.208 --> 00:15:34.458
-I'm not gonna adopt a Chinese kid.
-Or a Black kid. Any color is fine.

242
00:15:34.541 --> 00:15:37.166
You know what? Next year.
we'll join the float at Gay Pride.

243
00:15:37.250 --> 00:15:38.833
-In a thong! Why not?
-Papa. listen.

244
00:15:38.916 --> 00:15:41.666
-Let me explain. All right?
-Okay.

245
00:15:42.958 --> 00:15:45.458
Sara is a girl I just met
at my new school.

246
00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:49.833
And I-- I mean. I've never had the courage
to go talk to her because I-- I'm too shy.

247
00:15:49.916 --> 00:15:53.500
But one day. I overheard her saying
she's into vampires and <i>HollyBlood</i>

248
00:15:53.583 --> 00:15:55.541
and that she's in a chatroom. and so I…

249
00:15:56.041 --> 00:15:59.041
Well. I figured I'd join it
and. um. maybe pretend I'm Lidia.

250
00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:00.250
But why pretend?

251
00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:02.291
Just to chat a little. Nothing more.

252
00:16:02.375 --> 00:16:05.875
But the problem is.
it's all getting trickier and trickier.

253
00:16:05.958 --> 00:16:08.791
and she wants to meet in person
at the premiere of the vampire movie.

254
00:16:08.875 --> 00:16:11.791
And now there's some pervert.
a psychopath. pretending he's a vampire

255
00:16:11.875 --> 00:16:12.833
and wants to meet her.

256
00:16:12.916 --> 00:16:15.833
So I don't want her to go on her own.
but the problem is

257
00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:18.833
how can I be honest with her?

258
00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:22.708
Man. I guess I'd rather
you <i>were</i> a fruit. actually.

259
00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:26.125
I-- I'm sorry. gay. Gay. right?

260
00:16:28.625 --> 00:16:29.916
<i>Tomorrow is the big day.</i>

261
00:16:30.625 --> 00:16:32.416
<i>Thanks to my associate…</i>

262
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.500
…Samanthaxulita.

263
00:16:35.666 --> 00:16:38.333
I've worked out that the vampire Azrael

264
00:16:38.416 --> 00:16:41.125
will be at the premiere
of that crappy movie<i>.</i>

265
00:16:42.583 --> 00:16:43.833
<i>HollyBlood.</i>

266
00:16:46.916 --> 00:16:50.291
I will avenge
the death of those kids.

267
00:16:50.375 --> 00:16:52.166
And nothing is going to stop me.

268
00:17:01.708 --> 00:17:03.000
Mommy. uh.

269
00:17:03.083 --> 00:17:04.916
the zipper on my jacket's broken.

270
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Then wear the fleece shirt
you got from your grandma.

271
00:17:09.583 --> 00:17:10.583
<i>Dearest followers.</i>

272
00:17:11.416 --> 00:17:13.708
<i>if I'm murdered.</i>
<i>remember. it'll be my mother's fault</i>

273
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:15.916
<i>because she buys shit coats</i>
<i>at a mediocre market.</i>

274
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.541
The slippers. apparently.
are great quality.

275
00:17:26.458 --> 00:17:27.666
And pretty too.

276
00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:33.083
Here you go.
I'm sorry. I lost the gift receipt.

277
00:17:33.750 --> 00:17:36.500
Don't worry about it. It should be fine.

278
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Hey. listen. son.

279
00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:42.541
I don't know much about video games.
but I know a lot about love.

280
00:17:43.791 --> 00:17:47.541
Mom was seeing your best friend
for two years. and you didn't even notice.

281
00:17:47.625 --> 00:17:50.458
Okay. Okay.
Let's just ignore this tiny little detail.

282
00:17:50.541 --> 00:17:51.958
I know a lot on this matter.

283
00:17:53.291 --> 00:17:56.291
So. quick question.
Uh. that girl you like. Sara.

284
00:17:56.791 --> 00:17:58.333
does she have fun with Lidia?

285
00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:01.541
-So much.
-Okay.

286
00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:04.375
And is she comfortable
talking about anything with Lidia?

287
00:18:07.583 --> 00:18:08.416
Okay.

288
00:18:08.916 --> 00:18:10.916
So. even though
you're pretending you're Lidia.

289
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.458
she actually likes
the real person that's hiding.

290
00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:14.791
She does.

291
00:18:16.166 --> 00:18:18.250
Unless she's a lesbian. Is she a lesbian?

292
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.041
Hm. I don't think so.

293
00:18:21.125 --> 00:18:24.041
All right. So. in that case.
just be honest with her.

294
00:18:26.083 --> 00:18:26.916
Deal?

295
00:18:55.125 --> 00:18:57.333
AZRAEL. HERE'S MY PHOTO.
SO YOU RECOGNIZE ME.

296
00:18:57.416 --> 00:18:58.458
I'M BY THE ENTRANCE

297
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:19.458
I swear that bloodsucker's here!
But vampires don't show on camera!

298
00:19:33.250 --> 00:19:36.291
Where are you.
bloodsucking vampire motherfucker?!

299
00:19:37.583 --> 00:19:38.916
What are you talking about. fatty?

300
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.916
Take back everything
you just said about vampires.

301
00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.916
Vampires are monsters who murder

302
00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.333
and not romantic <i>HollyBlood</i> shit.

303
00:19:45.416 --> 00:19:46.666
Wait. Vampires are magical.

304
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:50.041
Vampires are dead.
which means you like necrophilia.

305
00:19:50.125 --> 00:19:51.208
Into what?

306
00:19:51.833 --> 00:19:53.458
Stamp collecting. you know?

307
00:19:53.541 --> 00:19:54.458
Oh. okay.

308
00:19:54.541 --> 00:19:57.166
Plus. they're hundreds of years old.

309
00:19:57.250 --> 00:19:59.500
So. technically.
you're in love with old people.

310
00:19:59.583 --> 00:20:01.250
-What the heck?!
-That's obscene.

311
00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:03.833
-What the hell-- Get outta here!
-Who do you think you are?

312
00:20:03.916 --> 00:20:05.708
Get outta here!

313
00:20:12.541 --> 00:20:13.375
Juan!

314
00:20:15.166 --> 00:20:16.666
Are you a fan of <i>HollyBlood</i>?

315
00:20:17.291 --> 00:20:18.125
Oh hey. Wait up.

316
00:20:18.208 --> 00:20:20.916
Perhaps we can talk for a minute?
Just before you go inside?

317
00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.166
Talk about what?

318
00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.625
Hey! Careful!

319
00:20:46.208 --> 00:20:48.833
-Wow! What are you doing?!
-What the heck?!

320
00:20:48.916 --> 00:20:49.916
Well. hello.

321
00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:30.666
I know that you're a vampire.

322
00:21:32.708 --> 00:21:34.291
and I'm willing to take the risk.

323
00:21:34.875 --> 00:21:36.958
Holly. I gotta tell you.

324
00:21:37.041 --> 00:21:39.958
although I'm a supernatural vampire
who is hundreds of years old.

325
00:21:40.041 --> 00:21:41.916
who has traveled the world
fleeing the sun.

326
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.291
from the Caspian Sea to the Far East.
I've never met anyone like you.

327
00:21:53.041 --> 00:21:54.375
Holly!

328
00:22:02.208 --> 00:22:04.250
Stop kissing that vampire.

329
00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:05.958
and kiss me instead.

330
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:08.541
Because I am a werewolf.

331
00:22:10.250 --> 00:22:11.958
and I will fight for your love.

332
00:22:23.083 --> 00:22:23.916
Holly!

333
00:22:27.583 --> 00:22:29.166
As this county's sheriff.

334
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.166
I will not allow a war
between werewolves and vampires.

335
00:22:32.666 --> 00:22:35.041
And why aren't you
wearing a shirt. Sheriff?

336
00:22:35.916 --> 00:22:39.625
Because I spilled my coffee
while I was driving. In the squad car.

337
00:22:42.458 --> 00:22:44.041
Dearest followers.

338
00:22:44.791 --> 00:22:46.291
a vampire has no reflection.

339
00:22:46.375 --> 00:22:48.625
-Shh!
-Shh!

340
00:22:51.625 --> 00:22:54.708
Basically.
wherever there's a gap. there he is.

341
00:23:06.833 --> 00:23:12.583
-Hey. Hey. what the heck are you doing?
-Shh! I'm filming a vampire! Jesus!

342
00:23:13.416 --> 00:23:14.250
Sorry.

343
00:23:17.291 --> 00:23:19.500
Oh. come on!

344
00:23:20.375 --> 00:23:22.208
Go bootleg at some other film premiere.

345
00:23:23.708 --> 00:23:25.041
Get off! Let me explain.

346
00:23:25.125 --> 00:23:28.791
The vampire is here. but I need you
to clear the theater so I can find him.

347
00:23:29.541 --> 00:23:30.458
Get out of here.

348
00:23:31.375 --> 00:23:33.750
The lead actor
is at the entrance signing autographs!

349
00:24:15.916 --> 00:24:17.083
Dearest followers.

350
00:24:17.166 --> 00:24:20.291
it seems that the new kid in my class
is unnaturally strong.

351
00:24:20.375 --> 00:24:21.833
He may be another vampire.

352
00:24:28.041 --> 00:24:29.583
Get out! Get outta here!

353
00:24:36.458 --> 00:24:39.500
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

354
00:24:39.583 --> 00:24:40.708
He's a hero!

355
00:24:42.958 --> 00:24:45.000
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

356
00:24:47.708 --> 00:24:49.416
How did you stop the scaffolding?

357
00:25:00.750 --> 00:25:03.166
<i>And the new kid at school</i>
<i>saved me. Juan.</i>

358
00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:04.333
<i>Javi.</i>

359
00:25:05.916 --> 00:25:07.791
<i>Did I tell you about him?</i>

360
00:25:09.708 --> 00:25:11.583
<i> I think so. Keep going.</i>

361
00:25:14.708 --> 00:25:17.916
<i>Well. Javi saved my life.</i>
<i>It was supernatural.</i>

362
00:25:23.041 --> 00:25:25.500
<i>What if Javi</i>
<i>is actually the vampire Azrael?</i>

363
00:25:26.833 --> 00:25:29.916
<i>Javi joined the school not long</i>
<i>after I started looking for Azrael.</i>

364
00:25:30.416 --> 00:25:31.458
<i>So?</i>

365
00:25:32.583 --> 00:25:34.583
<i>Maybe he found out</i>
<i>I was trying to find him</i>

366
00:25:34.666 --> 00:25:38.083
<i>and pretended to be a new student</i>
<i>so he could keep a close eye on me.</i>

367
00:25:38.166 --> 00:25:39.833
<i>And see if I could be trusted.</i>

368
00:25:39.916 --> 00:25:41.958
<i>Plus. he knew I was into vampires.</i>

369
00:25:43.041 --> 00:25:44.083
<i>What do you think?</i>

370
00:25:44.166 --> 00:25:46.333
<i>Am I crazy. or am I right?</i>

371
00:25:47.083 --> 00:25:48.333
<i>You're crazy.</i>

372
00:25:48.833 --> 00:25:50.208
<i>I wish he was Azrael.</i>

373
00:25:50.291 --> 00:25:52.625
<i>I wouldn't be able to resist</i>
<i>getting to know him.</i>

374
00:26:01.875 --> 00:26:03.625
<i>That's the only explanation.</i>

375
00:26:04.916 --> 00:26:06.250
<i>Javi is Azrael.</i>

376
00:26:29.833 --> 00:26:31.625
{\an8}MISSING

377
00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:39.333
Dear loyal followers of putastakeinit…

378
00:26:40.208 --> 00:26:41.500
I have holy water.

379
00:26:42.041 --> 00:26:45.291
Now we'll see if my classmate.
Javier. actually is a vampire.

380
00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.500
Uh. it's for an experiment
in science class.

381
00:27:02.791 --> 00:27:05.208
We'll get inside the lab
and set them free.

382
00:27:05.291 --> 00:27:07.875
Thanks to us.
those poor animals will be free again.

383
00:27:10.666 --> 00:27:11.625
Are you listening?

384
00:27:12.333 --> 00:27:13.291
Mm-hm.

385
00:27:22.666 --> 00:27:23.833
How's school going?

386
00:27:26.041 --> 00:27:28.541
-Not so bad.
-So why'd your family move here?

387
00:27:28.625 --> 00:27:31.250
My parents recently divorced.
and I went to live with my father.

388
00:27:31.333 --> 00:27:32.291
Yeah.

389
00:27:32.375 --> 00:27:33.458
Clearly.

390
00:27:34.416 --> 00:27:36.375
-What?
-No. no. stuff like that happens.

391
00:27:41.416 --> 00:27:43.625
Want some? It's <i>blood</i> sausage.

392
00:27:43.708 --> 00:27:45.416
Not for me. thanks. Blood sausage.

393
00:27:46.166 --> 00:27:47.208
it upsets my stomach.

394
00:27:47.291 --> 00:27:49.416
Come on. It's a blood sausage sandwich.

395
00:27:50.041 --> 00:27:51.750
Kinda like any other blood sausage. no?

396
00:27:56.166 --> 00:27:58.166
Want some water? It's truly divine.

397
00:27:58.250 --> 00:27:59.083
No. Thank you.

398
00:27:59.166 --> 00:28:00.791
-You sure?
-It's really okay.

399
00:28:01.875 --> 00:28:02.958
I have my own water.

400
00:28:08.416 --> 00:28:10.250
Why are you staring at the new student?

401
00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
I'm not staring.

402
00:28:30.166 --> 00:28:31.041
Are you okay?

403
00:28:31.125 --> 00:28:32.083
You all right?

404
00:28:33.708 --> 00:28:35.458
Hey. are you okay? Hey!

405
00:28:39.708 --> 00:28:41.000
-My eye!
-I'm sorry.

406
00:28:42.458 --> 00:28:44.666
Sorry. Sorry.

407
00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:47.333
-That's so gross!
-Hey. I gotta go. okay?

408
00:28:47.875 --> 00:28:49.666
Nice meeting you.I guess.

409
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.458
Come on.
Come on. Guys. run. Come on.

410
00:28:53.541 --> 00:28:56.166
You're sleeping. Come on!
José. get those legs up.

411
00:28:56.708 --> 00:28:58.041
MISSING

412
00:28:59.666 --> 00:29:00.500
Come on!

413
00:29:02.166 --> 00:29:04.708
Your secret's safe with me. Azrael.

414
00:29:09.375 --> 00:29:10.458
You figured me out.

415
00:29:11.375 --> 00:29:12.458
I knew it.

416
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.916
You found out I was following you
and decided to infiltrate the school

417
00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.458
to see if I could be trusted.

418
00:29:18.041 --> 00:29:18.875
Exactly.

419
00:29:18.958 --> 00:29:20.791
Then that whole thing happened
at the opening.

420
00:29:20.875 --> 00:29:22.708
and you had to reveal your identity.

421
00:29:22.791 --> 00:29:23.791
Precisely.

422
00:29:23.875 --> 00:29:27.250
And you ran off because you didn't want
the police asking any questions.

423
00:29:27.333 --> 00:29:29.208
Oh wow! You're right. of course.

424
00:29:29.291 --> 00:29:33.458
Come on. guys. you need to run
in case a sodomite tries to abduct you.

425
00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.750
Just like that poor kid. Borja.

426
00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.791
That's a very impressive tactic.

427
00:29:43.583 --> 00:29:44.416
What is?

428
00:29:45.208 --> 00:29:47.791
Passing yourself off
as some wimp who's out of shape

429
00:29:47.875 --> 00:29:49.166
so that you go unnoticed.

430
00:29:49.916 --> 00:29:51.458
It's the perfect cover.

431
00:29:52.541 --> 00:29:54.500
Actually. it's not that perfect.

432
00:29:54.583 --> 00:29:58.000
I have something to ask you.
but I understand if you say no.

433
00:29:58.083 --> 00:30:00.083
Would you like to meet up with me later?

434
00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.416
Hey. loser!

435
00:30:05.125 --> 00:30:07.375
It's just…
I have so many questions for you and--

436
00:30:07.458 --> 00:30:10.125
-I understand if you don't wanna.
-No. of course.

437
00:30:11.083 --> 00:30:13.500
-And where?
-At my house.

438
00:30:34.416 --> 00:30:37.666
I don't know why you were talking
to my girl. but don't do it again.

439
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:38.833
Are we clear?

440
00:30:43.791 --> 00:30:46.875
Good job. man. Good job.
What a fucking loser.

441
00:31:01.333 --> 00:31:03.791
<i>Azrael's nothing</i>
<i>like what I imagined.</i>

442
00:31:04.333 --> 00:31:05.166
<i>How so?</i>

443
00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.708
<i>Because he's kind. sweet. gentle.</i>

444
00:31:08.791 --> 00:31:09.958
<i>and pretty cute.</i>

445
00:31:13.791 --> 00:31:15.125
<i>You think he's cute?</i>

446
00:31:17.333 --> 00:31:19.541
<i>Yes. but something</i>
<i>doesn't make sense.</i>

447
00:31:20.208 --> 00:31:23.166
<i>His eyes and skin. They look almost human.</i>

448
00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:27.291
<i>So what?</i>

449
00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:31.666
<i>I don't know. It's strange.</i>
<i>It doesn't fit with everything I've read.</i>

450
00:31:37.625 --> 00:31:39.916
HOLLYBLOOD MAKEUP TUTORIAL

451
00:31:54.541 --> 00:31:57.083
Relax. It's what I really look like.

452
00:31:57.166 --> 00:32:00.708
I always wear makeup to look human
and put on contacts to go unnoticed.

453
00:32:01.875 --> 00:32:03.083
Who is it. Sara?

454
00:32:03.583 --> 00:32:05.791
A classmate from my high school. Grandma.

455
00:32:12.416 --> 00:32:13.333
You can do it?

456
00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:14.833
Do what?

457
00:32:14.916 --> 00:32:16.625
Go in someone's house
without being invited.

458
00:32:16.708 --> 00:32:18.666
But you-- You-- Earlier today…

459
00:32:20.208 --> 00:32:21.666
I misunderstood you. I guess.

460
00:32:22.416 --> 00:32:24.291
That's all right. I'll just go.

461
00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:25.208
No!

462
00:32:25.708 --> 00:32:28.458
It's just that vampires can't enter
a place unless they're invited.

463
00:32:28.541 --> 00:32:29.666
Or so I thought.

464
00:32:30.541 --> 00:32:34.208
Yes.
But since you invited me during our class.

465
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:35.750
that was enough.

466
00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:48.333
Here's almost everything that's ever been
written about your species.

467
00:32:48.916 --> 00:32:49.833
That's great.

468
00:32:49.916 --> 00:32:53.958
Well. what could I show you
that you don't already know?

469
00:32:55.250 --> 00:32:56.750
Is it true that you can turn into mist?

470
00:32:57.708 --> 00:32:59.291
Well. I wouldn't call it mist.

471
00:33:00.083 --> 00:33:01.500
It's more like a haze.

472
00:33:01.583 --> 00:33:03.416
What about the whole
being-in-sunlight thing?

473
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:07.916
-Huh. That's terrible for us.
-But I've seen you in broad daylight.

474
00:33:08.791 --> 00:33:11.583
What I mean is.
we need to put on sunscreen constantly.

475
00:33:11.666 --> 00:33:15.208
Of course. otherwise. our skin burns.
just like gringos in Mallorca.

476
00:33:18.041 --> 00:33:19.041
Really?

477
00:33:19.750 --> 00:33:21.375
Really?

478
00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:24.500
You're stalling because you don't wanna
give away your secrets.

479
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:25.958
You figured me out.

480
00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:29.041
If this information
fell into the wrong hands.

481
00:33:29.125 --> 00:33:30.833
that could be extremely dangerous.

482
00:33:32.791 --> 00:33:34.750
-And there's one more thing.
-Tell me.

483
00:33:36.541 --> 00:33:38.708
Have you ever killed anyone?
Even without meaning to--

484
00:33:38.791 --> 00:33:42.458
No! Never. no. Of course. I don't--
I don't even drink human blood.

485
00:33:42.541 --> 00:33:43.625
So how do you survive?

486
00:33:43.708 --> 00:33:44.875
Well. I'm a vegan vampire.

487
00:33:46.208 --> 00:33:48.375
-What?
-The only blood I drink is synthetic.

488
00:33:48.875 --> 00:33:51.000
Ever had soy milk?
Well. I drink soy blood.

489
00:33:51.083 --> 00:33:52.166
It's very similar.

490
00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:55.083
It's not that great.
But you kinda get used to it.

491
00:33:56.166 --> 00:33:58.750
-Have you ever managed to--
-Your mother was gorgeous.

492
00:33:59.625 --> 00:34:02.166
How did you know she was my mom?

493
00:34:05.916 --> 00:34:09.125
Because I can read your mind.
That's one of my powers.

494
00:34:09.833 --> 00:34:12.541
Relax. I only did it
to make sure you were trustworthy.

495
00:34:12.625 --> 00:34:15.541
-But I won't do it again.
-No. No. And what else?

496
00:34:17.166 --> 00:34:20.041
Well. I can tell that you're a girl
that's really into vampires.

497
00:34:20.125 --> 00:34:21.250
Now that's cheating.

498
00:34:22.666 --> 00:34:25.708
Because when you were young.
your mom took you to watch horror movies.

499
00:34:25.791 --> 00:34:27.166
but they didn't scare you.

500
00:34:27.250 --> 00:34:30.083
Because she explained
that monsters really did exist.

501
00:34:30.625 --> 00:34:33.333
and that meant incredible things
could happen in the world.

502
00:34:33.416 --> 00:34:34.833
What else do you see?

503
00:34:36.875 --> 00:34:39.000
I see a girl who isn't scared of anything.

504
00:34:40.416 --> 00:34:41.875
Other than dancing in public.

505
00:34:44.333 --> 00:34:45.333
That's right.

506
00:34:45.416 --> 00:34:48.041
And if she ever did do it.
which isn't likely.

507
00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:51.458
she'd only do it with someone special.

508
00:34:53.083 --> 00:34:54.416
Oh wow!

509
00:34:55.625 --> 00:34:58.833
I never told anyone that.
Well. just my friend Lidia.

510
00:34:58.916 --> 00:35:01.291
-If you like. I can write to her and--
-No! No.

511
00:35:02.208 --> 00:35:03.291
No. no. no.

512
00:35:03.375 --> 00:35:05.250
Because no one else can know
who I really am.

513
00:35:06.583 --> 00:35:08.708
Imagine. It'd be over for me.

514
00:35:09.750 --> 00:35:11.166
Okay. You're right.

515
00:35:12.583 --> 00:35:13.583
You can trust me.

516
00:35:21.625 --> 00:35:23.541
Man. it's Carmen! She actually did it.

517
00:35:24.208 --> 00:35:25.416
Do you like animals?

518
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.333
Hm?

519
00:35:32.125 --> 00:35:33.500
All right. you ready?

520
00:35:34.833 --> 00:35:35.833
On your marks.

521
00:35:36.583 --> 00:35:37.541
get set…

522
00:35:38.333 --> 00:35:40.958
Uh! That girl! Look!

523
00:35:41.041 --> 00:35:42.291
That little ninja!

524
00:35:42.958 --> 00:35:44.291
I'll show that rascal.

525
00:35:46.208 --> 00:35:47.458
Hey! Wait for me!

526
00:35:47.541 --> 00:35:49.333
Damn it. it's locked.

527
00:35:50.875 --> 00:35:53.041
You're late. Sara!
And what's he doing here?

528
00:35:53.125 --> 00:35:55.333
-Javi can open the door.
-A wimp like him?

529
00:35:56.416 --> 00:35:58.708
Please. we need to use your gift.

530
00:35:59.208 --> 00:36:01.541
I don't think this door
will be a problem for you.

531
00:36:01.625 --> 00:36:02.625
No.

532
00:36:05.458 --> 00:36:08.083
Sorry. I really don't know
if I should be doing this.

533
00:36:08.583 --> 00:36:11.875
Oh! You're saying that
you support those global cosmetics labs

534
00:36:11.958 --> 00:36:14.541
testing their products on poor.
innocent animals. huh?

535
00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Fine.

536
00:36:21.666 --> 00:36:22.666
Here we go.

537
00:36:28.416 --> 00:36:29.666
Hm.

538
00:36:45.625 --> 00:36:46.541
Whatever happens.

539
00:36:47.458 --> 00:36:48.791
don't hold it against me.

540
00:36:59.833 --> 00:37:02.208
-I'm sorry! Sir! Are you all right?
-Don't move!

541
00:37:02.291 --> 00:37:03.583
No. man! No-- No.

542
00:37:03.666 --> 00:37:05.125
Get down!

543
00:37:05.208 --> 00:37:08.250
Sara! Abort plan! Abort plan!
Let's get outta here immediately!

544
00:37:08.333 --> 00:37:10.625
Wait. kid!
We're not gonna hurt you!

545
00:37:10.708 --> 00:37:12.708
-Don't move!
-No!

546
00:37:18.458 --> 00:37:21.375
You stopped the bullet?

547
00:37:23.875 --> 00:37:24.916
Let's go!

548
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.958
No. man. It was a blank.

549
00:37:35.625 --> 00:37:37.625
They'll catch us!

550
00:37:37.708 --> 00:37:39.458
Why didn't we just fly away?

551
00:37:40.333 --> 00:37:43.041
I couldn't.
Police cars all have cameras.

552
00:37:58.208 --> 00:38:00.791
I know somewhere we can go. Okay?

553
00:38:02.125 --> 00:38:03.125
Yeah.

554
00:38:19.208 --> 00:38:20.458
What are you doing?

555
00:38:20.958 --> 00:38:22.291
Going into my house.

556
00:38:23.250 --> 00:38:24.250
Into your house?

557
00:38:25.708 --> 00:38:26.958
Well. it's rented.

558
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:32.666
What about all the castles
and mansions I read about?

559
00:38:34.041 --> 00:38:34.875
I lost 'em.

560
00:38:35.625 --> 00:38:36.625
Come on. come in.

561
00:38:51.708 --> 00:38:54.333
Nice. It looks just like
a teenager's room.

562
00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:57.416
Sure. That's because
I had to get my cover right.

563
00:38:58.125 --> 00:39:00.166
So the neighbors wouldn't get suspicious.

564
00:39:05.208 --> 00:39:06.666
BE A PRINCESS AND UNICORN TAMER

565
00:39:07.250 --> 00:39:10.458
Although you're off target here.
Who would own this video game?

566
00:39:18.166 --> 00:39:19.000
Thanks.

567
00:39:19.083 --> 00:39:20.666
I know this is new to you.

568
00:39:21.166 --> 00:39:22.000
What is?

569
00:39:22.625 --> 00:39:24.750
Inviting a mortal into your sanctuary.

570
00:39:25.625 --> 00:39:26.916
It makes me feel special.

571
00:39:31.791 --> 00:39:34.250
Although I'm an immortal vampire
who is hundreds of years old

572
00:39:34.333 --> 00:39:36.083
and has traveled the world
fleeing the sun.

573
00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:38.750
from the Caspian Sea to the Far Orient.

574
00:39:38.833 --> 00:39:40.750
I've never met anyone like you before.

575
00:39:42.708 --> 00:39:43.875
That's from <i>HollyBlood.</i>

576
00:39:44.833 --> 00:39:45.666
Oh.

577
00:39:50.791 --> 00:39:54.625
Okay. I guess you see me
as some lovestruck little teenager

578
00:39:54.708 --> 00:39:55.875
who's into rom-coms.

579
00:39:55.958 --> 00:39:56.833
No.

580
00:39:57.458 --> 00:39:58.875
But do you know something?

581
00:40:01.166 --> 00:40:02.708
I'm not so naive after all.

582
00:40:07.875 --> 00:40:09.750
All this is really weird.

583
00:40:09.833 --> 00:40:11.041
Yeah. You're telling me.

584
00:40:12.708 --> 00:40:14.333
It's like I already knew you.

585
00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:23.708
-Who's that?
-Sorry. I didn't know you guys were…

586
00:40:25.708 --> 00:40:29.666
Wait. What did you do to your face?
You're wearing contacts. Look at you.

587
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:32.541
Hello.
I'm Fernando. Javi's father.

588
00:40:33.583 --> 00:40:35.041
-How are you?
-Ah. he's your papa?

589
00:40:35.125 --> 00:40:37.208
No. no. no. He's not my papa.

590
00:40:37.291 --> 00:40:39.458
Of course I'm your father.
who else would I be?

591
00:40:41.250 --> 00:40:44.000
Calm down.
Svenjorgenskrunghdol… the third.

592
00:40:44.625 --> 00:40:46.958
-No need to pretend in front of her.
-Why would I pretend?

593
00:40:47.041 --> 00:40:48.375
What did you just call me?

594
00:40:48.958 --> 00:40:50.458
-This is Sara.
-Sara?

595
00:40:51.833 --> 00:40:52.750
Yes. Sara.

596
00:40:52.833 --> 00:40:55.375
Oh! Sara. yes.

597
00:40:56.666 --> 00:40:57.833
What's going on here?

598
00:40:58.416 --> 00:41:00.166
Nothing.
There's a really simple explanation.

599
00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:02.791
Easy to explain.
Uh. explain it. Explain it.

600
00:41:03.583 --> 00:41:07.500
He isn't called Fernando. He's called
Svenjorgenskrunghdol the third.

601
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.375
and he's a vampire like me.

602
00:41:09.458 --> 00:41:13.333
Oh. I'm a vampire. just-- Just like him.
Svenjorgenjandel… kruder.

603
00:41:13.416 --> 00:41:14.541
-Skrunghdol.
-Krundel.

604
00:41:14.625 --> 00:41:16.125
-The third.
-The third. hm.

605
00:41:16.791 --> 00:41:18.208
So he's not your papa?

606
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:20.250
Of course not.

607
00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:24.708
-It's sort of a disguise.
-Yes. it's like a cocktail dress.

608
00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:28.083
He pretends to be my papa
so that people don't suspect us.

609
00:41:28.166 --> 00:41:29.666
Since I'm an immortal teenager.

610
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:32.916
I can't rent an apartment. and if I did.
neighbors would get suspicious.

611
00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.333
I met Svenjorgenskrunghdol the third
hundreds of years ago.

612
00:41:35.416 --> 00:41:37.041
-The third.
-He was about to die of typhus.

613
00:41:37.125 --> 00:41:38.291
-Remember?
-Of course.

614
00:41:38.375 --> 00:41:41.750
And I converted him. and now we pretend
to be father and son as a cover.

615
00:41:42.250 --> 00:41:44.083
Well. there's an explanation. right?

616
00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:51.958
I read something
about vampires forming clans

617
00:41:52.041 --> 00:41:53.208
and their internal hierarchy.

618
00:41:53.291 --> 00:41:55.166
but I never thought
I'd experience it firsthand.

619
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:57.958
Well. I'm glad you are.
You get to learn a lot. Perfect. huh?

620
00:41:58.041 --> 00:42:00.541
Listen. my dear fake son.
I'm going back to bed.

621
00:42:01.041 --> 00:42:03.166
No! Not to sleep. Svenjorgenskrunghdol.

622
00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:06.458
You're going to your coffin
to regenerate your energy.

623
00:42:06.541 --> 00:42:07.625
That's right.

624
00:42:07.708 --> 00:42:10.125
I'm going to get that energy in my coffin.

625
00:42:10.208 --> 00:42:12.166
-Bye. Svenjorgenskrunghdol.
-See you later. Enjoy.

626
00:42:12.250 --> 00:42:14.583
Oh. it's my grand-mama.
She's not feeling well.

627
00:42:15.208 --> 00:42:16.291
I gotta go.

628
00:42:18.125 --> 00:42:19.083
I'll come with you.

629
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:22.208
No need. See you tomorrow.

630
00:42:29.125 --> 00:42:32.291
I guess you won't
give me any grandchildren.

631
00:42:32.375 --> 00:42:34.250
Uh. this isn't a good idea.

632
00:42:36.583 --> 00:42:38.916
But this way.
Sara wants to spend time with me.

633
00:42:39.666 --> 00:42:42.875
With you? Or with the vampire
wearing makeup like George Michael?

634
00:42:54.375 --> 00:42:56.791
Dearest followers of putastakeinit!

635
00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:59.750
This stuff about vampires is a big joke.

636
00:43:00.333 --> 00:43:03.166
You know what?
I thought they didn't reflect on a video.

637
00:43:03.250 --> 00:43:04.333
But Javi can do this.

638
00:43:05.750 --> 00:43:08.666
However.
he did stop a bullet and scaffolding.

639
00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.625
We'll find out what he does
with this stake right here.

640
00:43:26.416 --> 00:43:28.416
<i>This is for your parents.</i>

641
00:43:28.500 --> 00:43:32.125
Remember. next week
we're organizing a blood drive.

642
00:43:32.208 --> 00:43:34.750
A Christian duty that you cannot miss.

643
00:43:36.333 --> 00:43:38.000
Before class begins.

644
00:43:39.125 --> 00:43:42.125
we're going to say
the Lord's Prayer for Borja.

645
00:43:42.208 --> 00:43:44.833
so he'll be returned to us safe and sound.

646
00:43:45.541 --> 00:43:49.791
Our Father. who art in Heaven.
hallowed be thy name.

647
00:43:49.875 --> 00:43:51.291
Thy kingdom come.

648
00:43:51.375 --> 00:43:54.166
Thy will be done.
on Earth as it is in Heaven.

649
00:43:54.250 --> 00:43:55.916
Give us this day our daily bread.

650
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.375
Hey. Hey!

651
00:43:57.958 --> 00:43:59.750
Where did you go after the lab last night?

652
00:43:59.833 --> 00:44:01.541
-I went to Javi's house.
-What?!

653
00:44:02.291 --> 00:44:03.125
Ladies. Quiet.

654
00:44:03.916 --> 00:44:06.875
Would you like to share your thoughts
with the rest of your classmates?

655
00:44:11.416 --> 00:44:12.333
Hey.

656
00:44:15.083 --> 00:44:16.875
They told me to come here.

657
00:44:38.083 --> 00:44:41.000
Late to your first period. dear?
Unacceptable.

658
00:44:41.083 --> 00:44:43.083
I'd give you an excuse.

659
00:44:43.166 --> 00:44:46.375
But I can't think of one right now.
I promise it won't happen again.

660
00:44:47.166 --> 00:44:48.291
Swear to God.

661
00:45:02.958 --> 00:45:06.041
Come on. guys. Throw the ball.

662
00:45:06.125 --> 00:45:09.541
Come on!
Diego. you're fast asleep. Don't stop.

663
00:45:10.125 --> 00:45:12.916
Come on. Keep bouncing. Come on!

664
00:45:16.458 --> 00:45:18.875
I'm gonna put some music on
to liven things up.

665
00:45:18.958 --> 00:45:20.500
Keep bouncing. I'll be right back.

666
00:45:27.208 --> 00:45:28.458
I had a good time yesterday.

667
00:45:28.541 --> 00:45:31.500
Although I guess you already know that
since you can read my mind.

668
00:45:32.416 --> 00:45:33.250
Sure.

669
00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.166
But I promise not to do it again.

670
00:45:37.208 --> 00:45:38.666
What am I thinking right now?

671
00:45:41.625 --> 00:45:42.458
Sara!

672
00:45:45.416 --> 00:45:47.500
I figured out
why you're so glued to that dude.

673
00:45:47.583 --> 00:45:48.458
Oh yeah?

674
00:45:48.541 --> 00:45:50.875
Because you love the weirdos
no one else likes.

675
00:45:51.708 --> 00:45:53.416
If I liked misfits who no one likes.

676
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:56.750
I would've gone out with you
a long time ago. Am I being clear?

677
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:04.125
Don't try to deny it! You used to hang out
with that freak. Diego.

678
00:46:04.208 --> 00:46:06.458
And now with that loony girl
obsessed with animals.

679
00:46:07.291 --> 00:46:09.708
Why don't you dump those weirdos.
and just go out

680
00:46:10.208 --> 00:46:11.208
with me?

681
00:46:11.291 --> 00:46:12.625
Music!

682
00:46:21.333 --> 00:46:23.083
What's going on. Sara?

683
00:46:24.958 --> 00:46:26.916
Sara. what are you doing?

684
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.541
-Sara?
-Shall we dance?

685
00:46:49.291 --> 00:46:50.166
Oh no.

686
00:47:45.333 --> 00:47:46.291
Whoo!

687
00:48:24.083 --> 00:48:27.041
Listen to me. you piece of shit!
I don't know why Sara likes you--

688
00:48:27.125 --> 00:48:28.333
I don't know!

689
00:48:28.416 --> 00:48:31.000
But she's mine. all mine. you get that?

690
00:48:31.083 --> 00:48:32.916
Sara's free to choose who she wants.

691
00:48:33.583 --> 00:48:36.791
Neither you. I. or any other guy
has the right to decide for her.

692
00:48:45.916 --> 00:48:48.000
So get this straight.
I'd never date a bully like you.

693
00:48:48.083 --> 00:48:48.958
Sara!

694
00:48:49.041 --> 00:48:51.958
Javi. however.
is kind. trustworthy. and helpful.

695
00:48:52.541 --> 00:48:53.625
And really cute.

696
00:48:53.708 --> 00:48:57.208
You know what? You should thank me
because I just saved your life.

697
00:48:57.291 --> 00:48:59.375
If Javi had confronted you.
you'd be in a hospital.

698
00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:00.833
He's not who you think.

699
00:49:00.916 --> 00:49:02.208
What?!

700
00:49:02.291 --> 00:49:06.000
Ouch! Sara!
Careful! Careful! Ouch! Stop! Stop! Stop!

701
00:49:07.583 --> 00:49:09.666
All right. All right. Stop. Just stop!

702
00:49:09.750 --> 00:49:11.500
I'm fine! I'm fine!

703
00:49:11.583 --> 00:49:14.250
-Come on. let's go. Javi.
-Listen to me. moron!

704
00:49:15.458 --> 00:49:18.083
I swear on Sergio Ramos
in our tenth victory.

705
00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.708
I am the rooster in this yard.
and you're gonna be my new chicken.

706
00:49:32.458 --> 00:49:33.958
What's happening?

707
00:49:39.333 --> 00:49:41.083
You really need to tell her.

708
00:49:42.375 --> 00:49:43.750
I'm sure she'll understand.

709
00:49:49.458 --> 00:49:51.541
That whole dancing thing got me thinking.

710
00:49:52.041 --> 00:49:54.291
As in.
we'll never be famous choreographers?

711
00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.625
Let's meet in front of the school tonight.

712
00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.000
Roofied her drink. right?

713
00:50:14.875 --> 00:50:15.833
-Come again?
-Hmm?

714
00:50:16.583 --> 00:50:18.541
I guess you roofied her drink.
I don't see how else

715
00:50:18.625 --> 00:50:20.041
you could hook up with Sara.

716
00:50:21.125 --> 00:50:23.000
-She loves the way I am.
-Hm?

717
00:50:23.083 --> 00:50:24.875
Oh? Yeah. Right.

718
00:50:24.958 --> 00:50:27.041
-She's into some hairy dude.
-Furry.

719
00:50:27.125 --> 00:50:28.208
-Introvert.
-Reserved.

720
00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:29.291
And a weirdo.

721
00:50:30.291 --> 00:50:32.416
Mysterious. Hm?

722
00:50:33.458 --> 00:50:34.708
I'm just mysterious.

723
00:50:35.541 --> 00:50:37.708
My friend. I'll say this only once.

724
00:50:38.208 --> 00:50:41.125
I'll figure out how you managed
to fool her. and I'll get rid of you. hm?

725
00:50:41.208 --> 00:50:42.791
I won't let you hurt my friend.

726
00:51:00.500 --> 00:51:01.958
Why do you look so human?

727
00:51:03.875 --> 00:51:04.708
Listen.

728
00:51:05.416 --> 00:51:06.875
I need to tell you something.

729
00:51:07.875 --> 00:51:08.875
I'll go first.

730
00:51:09.875 --> 00:51:10.875
Come on.

731
00:51:14.916 --> 00:51:16.291
Wait. What if we get caught?

732
00:51:16.375 --> 00:51:19.291
As if an immortal vampire
cared about that.

733
00:51:53.833 --> 00:51:55.333
What are we doing here?

734
00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.666
When my mom was diagnosed with cancer.
we used to come here every day.

735
00:52:05.666 --> 00:52:08.708
In the water. when she was swimming.
she'd feel better. and

736
00:52:08.791 --> 00:52:11.000
those were the only moments
I saw her smile.

737
00:52:11.083 --> 00:52:13.458
Since then.
I haven't had the courage to come here.

738
00:52:14.416 --> 00:52:15.500
Until now. With you.

739
00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000
Do it.

740
00:52:30.916 --> 00:52:31.916
Do what?

741
00:52:32.625 --> 00:52:33.500
Turn me into one.

742
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.333
Sara…

743
00:52:36.916 --> 00:52:39.666
We'll be forever young.
And we'll never get old either.

744
00:52:40.541 --> 00:52:41.750
We'll never die or suffer.

745
00:52:43.833 --> 00:52:45.000
As your mother did?

746
00:52:47.166 --> 00:52:49.750
You made me discover
that the impossible can be real.

747
00:52:49.833 --> 00:52:50.916
I know she was right.

748
00:52:52.583 --> 00:52:53.583
So please do it.

749
00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.416
No. I won't.

750
00:52:59.875 --> 00:53:00.708
Why not?

751
00:53:01.916 --> 00:53:02.916
Well. because…

752
00:53:06.208 --> 00:53:07.583
Because… that's a curse!

753
00:53:08.333 --> 00:53:10.625
And the thirst for blood
will eventually overwhelm you.

754
00:53:10.708 --> 00:53:11.916
and you'll have to kill.

755
00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:16.208
-I'll have the synthetic blood you have.
-Yeah. but. um. it's really gross.

756
00:53:22.625 --> 00:53:23.750
I understand.

757
00:53:23.833 --> 00:53:24.666
Really?

758
00:53:26.791 --> 00:53:28.541
-I mean. I'm sorry. it's just--
-No.

759
00:53:28.625 --> 00:53:30.750
-I should tell you--
-I've been such a fool.

760
00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:34.458
I mean. of course
you don't wanna spend eternity with me.

761
00:53:35.666 --> 00:53:39.541
Over so much time. you must have met
other girls. and I totally get it.

762
00:53:40.208 --> 00:53:42.500
I'm just one more girl. I'm just one more.

763
00:53:42.583 --> 00:53:43.541
S-- Sara.

764
00:53:44.791 --> 00:53:46.500
No. I'm okay. Don't worry.

765
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:51.750
Sara.

766
00:54:10.625 --> 00:54:12.791
-Huh?
-Go to hell. you vampire!

767
00:54:15.125 --> 00:54:16.875
Dude. what's wrong with you?

768
00:54:17.875 --> 00:54:19.833
Hey! Why are you doing this?

769
00:54:21.083 --> 00:54:24.083
Suffer with my stinking
garlic breath. vampire!

770
00:54:24.166 --> 00:54:25.041
Beelzebub!

771
00:54:26.958 --> 00:54:29.166
Wait! W-- W-- Wait!
Look! Look! Look! Look!

772
00:54:29.250 --> 00:54:31.250
If I were a vampire.
you wouldn't see my reflection.

773
00:54:31.333 --> 00:54:34.291
Yeah. but I know you have a reflection.
thanks to my videos.

774
00:54:34.375 --> 00:54:36.333
But I'm not a vampire. Diego! Come on!

775
00:54:36.416 --> 00:54:38.458
Right. I saw you stop a bullet
and a scaffolding.

776
00:54:38.541 --> 00:54:40.500
The bullet must've been a blank. I guess.

777
00:54:40.583 --> 00:54:43.625
I didn't stop the scaffolding. okay?
It was a safety chain. It wasn't me.

778
00:54:43.708 --> 00:54:48.916
If I stab you with this stake and you die.
that will prove that you're a vampire!

779
00:54:50.625 --> 00:54:52.541
And if I'm not. I'll die. Diego!

780
00:54:52.625 --> 00:54:55.708
And if I die. you'll go to jail.
You don't wanna go to jail. right?

781
00:54:55.791 --> 00:54:57.750
Look at me. You don't wanna go to jail.

782
00:54:58.458 --> 00:55:01.125
If you're not a vampire.
then why are you pretending to be one?

783
00:55:02.958 --> 00:55:05.541
-To win the girl of my dreams.
-Yeah. Of course.

784
00:55:05.625 --> 00:55:08.166
Can you really be this dumb
to pretend to be a vampire

785
00:55:08.250 --> 00:55:09.958
just to hook up with a girl?

786
00:55:10.791 --> 00:55:13.625
Sara thought that…
that I was a vampire named Azrael.

787
00:55:13.708 --> 00:55:15.666
and I didn't have the guts
to tell her otherwise.

788
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:17.583
She thinks you're Azrael?

789
00:55:26.666 --> 00:55:28.208
Can I go get my pants?

790
00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:30.958
Holy water never fails.

791
00:55:31.041 --> 00:55:33.166
If you were a vampire.
you'd be burning up.

792
00:55:33.666 --> 00:55:35.541
That's right. But I'm not one.

793
00:55:35.625 --> 00:55:37.541
I bet you threw the water away.

794
00:55:38.291 --> 00:55:40.708
-When?!
-You tell me. Vampires can be superfast.

795
00:55:42.416 --> 00:55:45.541
Listen. I mean. seriously.
what can I do to make you trust me?

796
00:55:58.583 --> 00:56:01.541
I had to make sure that
you actually swallowed it.

797
00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.291
Including sticking your tongue
inside my mouth?

798
00:56:04.375 --> 00:56:06.708
N-- N-- No. Just an involuntary reflex.

799
00:56:06.791 --> 00:56:08.541
So what's going on here?

800
00:56:09.125 --> 00:56:11.250
You guys set off the alarm.

801
00:56:14.625 --> 00:56:17.083
Thing is. we do gay satanism. Father.

802
00:56:19.083 --> 00:56:21.000
Can I go get my pants. please. Father?

803
00:56:23.583 --> 00:56:25.291
Come here!

804
00:56:25.375 --> 00:56:29.500
Come on. Let's go. slackers!
Come on! Come on! Come on!

805
00:56:46.125 --> 00:56:50.000
<i>Jeez. Lidia. I need to talk to you.</i>
<i>You're the only person who gets me!</i>

806
00:56:55.208 --> 00:56:56.833
What did that loser do to you?

807
00:56:59.416 --> 00:57:00.875
I'm gonna kill him.

808
00:57:01.625 --> 00:57:04.250
-I don't think you can.
-What do you mean?

809
00:57:06.250 --> 00:57:07.291
Come on.

810
00:57:08.625 --> 00:57:10.166
You can tell your best friend.

811
00:57:12.541 --> 00:57:14.708
You remember the premiere
of that movie <i>HollyBlood</i>?

812
00:57:14.791 --> 00:57:17.416
That crappy macho movie
with the shirtless guys?

813
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:20.291
-Something unusual happened.
-Did it end up being a good movie?

814
00:57:21.666 --> 00:57:25.041
I almost got flattened. and Javi saved me
using superhuman strength.

815
00:57:27.125 --> 00:57:28.625
So he's a superhero. right?

816
00:57:28.708 --> 00:57:31.875
-No. He's a vampire.
-You're still into this nonsense?

817
00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:35.750
Oh shit. Why didn't I do the same thing
I did with Manu?

818
00:57:35.833 --> 00:57:36.916
What do you mean?

819
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.916
Who else do you think spread that rumor
about Manu's micro penis?

820
00:57:40.416 --> 00:57:43.166
That was me.
Hey. but I did this for you. huh?

821
00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:45.625
To save you from dating another jerk.

822
00:57:45.708 --> 00:57:49.583
And yet. you're still into your crap
about vampires. Sara.

823
00:57:50.083 --> 00:57:53.250
Come on. open your eyes.
Life is not a <i>My Little Pony</i> show.

824
00:57:54.916 --> 00:57:56.083
I need to be alone.

825
00:57:58.125 --> 00:57:59.041
Then be alone.

826
00:57:59.833 --> 00:58:02.208
But remember
that I'm the only one you can trust.

827
00:58:02.291 --> 00:58:04.333
The only one!

828
00:58:06.833 --> 00:58:09.333
And those fucking vampires do not exist!

829
00:58:16.250 --> 00:58:18.875
Hey. Sara.
you've been avoiding me all day.

830
00:58:19.375 --> 00:58:20.625
We need to talk.

831
00:58:20.708 --> 00:58:22.833
That's right. We definitely need to talk.

832
00:58:26.250 --> 00:58:28.500
See that? Apart from not being photogenic.

833
00:58:28.583 --> 00:58:30.583
if he was a vampire.
he wouldn't appear on the photo.

834
00:58:30.666 --> 00:58:32.625
-That's what all the movies say.
-Carmen!

835
00:58:32.708 --> 00:58:34.791
Don't "Carmen" me!
Can't you see he's using you?

836
00:58:34.875 --> 00:58:36.875
Can't you see that? Jesus Christ!

837
00:58:36.958 --> 00:58:38.166
Vampires don't exist!

838
00:58:38.250 --> 00:58:39.416
Stop it. Carmen.

839
00:58:40.125 --> 00:58:43.291
If he's so strong. he should prove it
by stopping a car in its tracks.

840
00:58:43.375 --> 00:58:46.250
He doesn't need to prove anything.
I trust him. okay?

841
00:58:57.833 --> 00:58:59.208
What are you doing?

842
00:59:11.166 --> 00:59:13.458
Let's see
if you can stop this car.

843
00:59:20.750 --> 00:59:22.708
What are you doing? I have to help her!

844
00:59:30.041 --> 00:59:31.000
What are you doing?

845
00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:32.916
Quiet.

846
00:59:34.708 --> 00:59:36.875
I'm going to show you
this guy isn't Azrael.

847
00:59:36.958 --> 00:59:38.833
the vampire you've been looking for

848
00:59:38.916 --> 00:59:41.375
and were supposed to meet
at the <i>HollyBlood </i>premiere<i>.</i>

849
00:59:41.458 --> 00:59:42.875
How do you know all that?

850
00:59:43.583 --> 00:59:44.791
<i>I </i>am Azrael.

851
00:59:44.875 --> 00:59:46.916
And this asshole isn't a vampire.

852
00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.791
He's just been using you.

853
00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:52.208
I don't know what you want.
but you're lying.

854
00:59:55.041 --> 00:59:57.500
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!

855
00:59:58.125 --> 00:59:58.958
Sara.

856
01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:02.166
What are you doing? Stop!

857
01:00:02.791 --> 01:00:04.625
Javi. do something!

858
01:00:05.875 --> 01:00:09.125
Grab your cellphone and take our photo.
And open your eyes.

859
01:00:21.125 --> 01:00:22.958
So this means you're not a vampire?

860
01:00:24.375 --> 01:00:26.750
But the scaffolding? And that bullet?

861
01:00:26.833 --> 01:00:30.041
No idea. but-- but I saw it was gonna
fall on you and I rushed to

862
01:00:30.541 --> 01:00:33.083
hold on and there was a chain
that helped stop it.

863
01:00:33.166 --> 01:00:36.583
And as for the bullet. I have no idea.
I guess it was a blank.

864
01:00:38.458 --> 01:00:41.208
You used this poor girl
so you could hook up with her.

865
01:00:41.291 --> 01:00:42.666
What am I gonna do with you?

866
01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:46.916
Just let him go.

867
01:00:47.708 --> 01:00:48.541
Please.

868
01:01:03.583 --> 01:01:06.208
If you tell anyone who I am

869
01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:07.875
or ever come near Sara…

870
01:01:14.791 --> 01:01:16.958
Do you wanna get to know the real Azrael?

871
01:01:19.250 --> 01:01:20.250
Carmen.

872
01:01:43.458 --> 01:01:46.166
So someone at your school
is an immortal vampire

873
01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:49.416
who's hundreds of years old.
and he found out that you're <i>not</i> a vampire

874
01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:51.333
and that you were pretending to be him.

875
01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:53.541
and now he's gonna go out
with the girl you were dating

876
01:01:53.625 --> 01:01:55.583
because she thought <i>you</i> were a vampire?

877
01:01:56.208 --> 01:01:58.666
Vampire. Yes. That's it.

878
01:02:00.541 --> 01:02:01.416
Look. kiddo.

879
01:02:01.958 --> 01:02:04.583
If I wanted to hear nonsense
about teenage vampires.

880
01:02:04.666 --> 01:02:07.083
I'd go to the movie theater
and watch <i>HollyBlood.</i>

881
01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.416
And if you're that worried.
get help from a vampire slayer.

882
01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:19.166
<i>Put it all the way in.</i>
<i>Put it deep inside. big guy.</i>

883
01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:21.041
I knew it! I knew that…

884
01:02:21.125 --> 01:02:22.625
-Huh?
-Can… You…

885
01:02:22.708 --> 01:02:24.958
Can-- Can you tell me
what you guys are doing?

886
01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:29.666
I'm Diego. the vampire slayer.
Right in the heart. come on.

887
01:02:29.750 --> 01:02:30.833
Who is this guy?

888
01:02:35.458 --> 01:02:36.291
All right. Dad.

889
01:02:36.375 --> 01:02:38.541
I know this is gonna sound
a little crazy to you.

890
01:02:38.625 --> 01:02:41.125
but we're training and getting ready
to slay an immortal vampire.

891
01:02:41.208 --> 01:02:42.750
-Mm-hmm.
-Nah.

892
01:02:42.833 --> 01:02:46.500
A <i>little</i> crazy would be telling me
that you'd like to get a tattoo.

893
01:02:46.583 --> 01:02:50.000
What you just said is enough
to get you sent away forever. okay?

894
01:02:50.083 --> 01:02:52.416
It's already weird
that you're trying to look like a vampire

895
01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:54.291
just to hook up
with that young lady. Sara.

896
01:02:54.958 --> 01:02:57.375
That was some premium-level stalking.
Can't deny that.

897
01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.041
For sure. I said to myself.
"That's part of puberty."

898
01:03:00.125 --> 01:03:02.291
"It's a tough age.
You gotta give him some space."

899
01:03:02.375 --> 01:03:04.791
Right? But you're pushing it
to the limit. come on.

900
01:03:04.875 --> 01:03:07.291
Listen. Dad.
whether you believe it or not.

901
01:03:07.375 --> 01:03:10.083
if we don't stop that creature.
Sara's gonna be in trouble.

902
01:03:11.583 --> 01:03:14.166
I swear on <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>.
he's not lying.

903
01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:18.250
That bloodsucker goes by the name
of Azrael. and this is what he looks like.

904
01:03:21.625 --> 01:03:24.625
Well. the name of that kid is not Azrael.
He was in my class.

905
01:03:24.708 --> 01:03:27.708
His name was Antonio Caldera or Pelofrito.

906
01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.458
Pelofrito?

907
01:03:32.541 --> 01:03:36.250
They found him in the street.
He was soaking wet and disoriented.

908
01:03:36.333 --> 01:03:38.458
No idea how he'd ended up out there.

909
01:03:38.541 --> 01:03:41.208
It was on the same night
a pervert abducted those boys.

910
01:03:41.291 --> 01:03:44.458
Maybe he abducted him too?
And then he ran away.

911
01:03:44.541 --> 01:03:48.041
But of course. right before he ran away.
he went on to…

912
01:03:50.291 --> 01:03:51.750
Get to the point. Dad.

913
01:03:51.833 --> 01:03:54.625
After that. he changed.
Not at all like he used to be.

914
01:03:54.708 --> 01:03:56.583
And the next day. he vanished.

915
01:03:56.666 --> 01:04:00.083
But the worst part about that.
really the weirdest freaking thing.

916
01:04:00.708 --> 01:04:01.708
was that…

917
01:04:01.791 --> 01:04:02.625
-What?
-What?

918
01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:05.666
…right before he ran away
he hooked up with my girlfriend.

919
01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:07.000
My Mariana.

920
01:04:08.875 --> 01:04:10.500
Let's see.

921
01:04:13.291 --> 01:04:14.625
It's like in those movies

922
01:04:14.708 --> 01:04:17.666
when they take the glasses off
the ugly girl. and she becomes hot.

923
01:04:18.333 --> 01:04:19.958
But if Azrael isn't Azrael.

924
01:04:20.708 --> 01:04:22.500
then who is Azrael?

925
01:04:24.125 --> 01:04:25.291
I got no idea.

926
01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:29.708
Whoever that is.

927
01:04:31.333 --> 01:04:32.708
I won't let him hurt Sara.

928
01:04:33.375 --> 01:04:36.458
Look. son. I'm not sure I believe
all this nonsense about vampires.

929
01:04:36.541 --> 01:04:40.166
but I won't permit anyone
to hurt my soon-to-be daughter-in-law.

930
01:04:40.250 --> 01:04:41.208
Enough talk!

931
01:04:43.041 --> 01:04:44.541
It's time to go hunting. guys.

932
01:04:46.541 --> 01:04:48.000
Argh!

933
01:05:04.166 --> 01:05:05.666
Dad. your jacket?

934
01:05:05.750 --> 01:05:07.916
This is the jacket
I used to wear to school.

935
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.500
Makes me feel powerful.

936
01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:11.833
And I look sexy in it. eh? Don't I?

937
01:05:30.833 --> 01:05:32.166
Why did you bring me here?

938
01:05:33.125 --> 01:05:34.208
It's a surprise.

939
01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:36.750
Stand back.

940
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.333
My God…

941
01:05:54.416 --> 01:05:57.666
Goodness gracious!
Maybe we can't handle this guy.

942
01:05:58.875 --> 01:06:00.958
No-- I'm not saying it because of me.

943
01:06:01.041 --> 01:06:03.875
I'm saying it for you guys.
The weaker guys in the group.

944
01:06:05.166 --> 01:06:08.166
My goodness. that's Pelofrito.
I can't believe my eyes.

945
01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:11.500
We're gonna need backup.

946
01:06:12.083 --> 01:06:14.750
I mean. more than backup. A real army.

947
01:06:14.833 --> 01:06:16.666
Tough guys who don't think too much.

948
01:06:19.333 --> 01:06:20.291
Diego.

949
01:06:20.916 --> 01:06:22.250
Do you have Manu's number?

950
01:06:25.375 --> 01:06:26.708
-Let's go!
-Come on!

951
01:06:26.791 --> 01:06:27.625
Let's go!

952
01:06:28.541 --> 01:06:32.666
We're winning. yeah! Let's go! Come on!

953
01:06:34.541 --> 01:06:36.500
{\an8}DIEGO
SARA AND THE GUY WHO BROKE YOUR FINGER

954
01:06:36.583 --> 01:06:38.541
{\an8}ARE HOOKING UP AT SCHOOL
AND LAUGHING AT YOU.

955
01:06:38.625 --> 01:06:39.541
{\an8}What's up?

956
01:06:42.291 --> 01:06:45.416
Hey. where you going?
That's a Real Madrid game. That's sacred.

957
01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.708
There's something more sacred.

958
01:06:46.791 --> 01:06:48.708
Real Madrid in the Champions League match?

959
01:06:48.791 --> 01:06:49.708
No. Quini.

960
01:06:50.791 --> 01:06:51.958
That's honor.

961
01:06:53.958 --> 01:06:56.125
And does honor require punching people?

962
01:06:56.625 --> 01:06:57.833
Yeah. no doubt about it.

963
01:07:02.041 --> 01:07:02.875
Let's go.

964
01:07:06.583 --> 01:07:08.541
How many rubbers do we have?

965
01:07:09.041 --> 01:07:09.958
At least 100.

966
01:07:10.750 --> 01:07:15.375
Son. I know this isn't the right time.
but I love it when we do stuff together.

967
01:07:25.666 --> 01:07:27.166
What are we doing here?

968
01:07:27.833 --> 01:07:30.291
I can give you
what that phony promised you.

969
01:07:30.375 --> 01:07:31.833
Wanna live forever?

970
01:07:37.916 --> 01:07:39.000
I am prepared for it.

971
01:07:53.541 --> 01:07:55.416
That's what you wanted. right?

972
01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:56.958
What are you doing?

973
01:07:57.791 --> 01:07:59.500
You were supposed to transform me.

974
01:08:00.291 --> 01:08:01.666
Oh. don't play hard to get.

975
01:08:02.416 --> 01:08:03.458
Wanna be immortal?

976
01:08:04.125 --> 01:08:05.333
Do it for your mother.

977
01:08:07.416 --> 01:08:08.791
Well. I'm having second thoughts.

978
01:08:08.875 --> 01:08:10.500
-Now get outta my way or--
-What?

979
01:08:10.583 --> 01:08:11.750
What you gonna do to me?

980
01:08:12.708 --> 01:08:14.083
What I'd do to any other dude!

981
01:08:19.583 --> 01:08:21.666
I swear on Real Madrid.

982
01:08:21.750 --> 01:08:24.250
the most sacred thing
in the whole wide world.

983
01:08:24.333 --> 01:08:26.208
no one laughs at me!

984
01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:36.083
Oh. matador!

985
01:08:36.166 --> 01:08:38.416
-Oh yeah! You told him!
-Yeah.

986
01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.208
-You killed him!
-Ow. dick!

987
01:08:40.291 --> 01:08:41.583
Don't change. dude.

988
01:08:44.833 --> 01:08:46.958
-Don't fuck about.
-He's out cold.

989
01:08:47.041 --> 01:08:48.250
Did you kill him?

990
01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:50.541
-You killed him.
-He's not moving?

991
01:08:51.791 --> 01:08:52.958
It was self-defense.

992
01:08:54.375 --> 01:08:55.375
You saw that.

993
01:08:56.083 --> 01:08:58.250
-Yeah.
-Yeah. let's get outta here.

994
01:09:03.208 --> 01:09:04.500
Run!

995
01:09:04.583 --> 01:09:06.250
Run! Run! Get outta here!

996
01:09:23.416 --> 01:09:26.041
Ah! Fuck!

997
01:09:26.125 --> 01:09:27.500
What are you doing here?

998
01:09:28.083 --> 01:09:29.708
Sara came to see me in the hospital.

999
01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:33.041
told me she'd arranged to meet the new guy
and that I might never see her again.

1000
01:09:34.333 --> 01:09:37.416
I can't believe this!
A fucking vampire!

1001
01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.625
A fucking vampire. dude!

1002
01:09:39.708 --> 01:09:42.000
A fucking vampire!

1003
01:09:42.083 --> 01:09:43.916
Hey. look. There's our backup. guys.

1004
01:09:44.958 --> 01:09:45.791
What?

1005
01:09:45.875 --> 01:09:46.833
Let's go. Let's go.

1006
01:09:57.125 --> 01:10:01.125
-Let's get out this way!
-No. no. dude! Please no!

1007
01:10:02.333 --> 01:10:03.750
The thing you said earlier

1008
01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.458
about Real Madrid?

1009
01:10:05.541 --> 01:10:08.041
Yes! Yes! I love 'em to death!

1010
01:10:08.625 --> 01:10:11.500
I won't hurt you
if you sing the fight song for Barcelona.

1011
01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:12.416
What?

1012
01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:14.250
No!

1013
01:10:14.333 --> 01:10:16.125
Sing that fucking anthem right now!

1014
01:10:32.458 --> 01:10:33.375
Stop it. Azrael!

1015
01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.958
Or should we call you Pelofrito?

1016
01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:40.166
We know you're a fucking liar!
You're gonna get soaked in holy water.

1017
01:10:40.250 --> 01:10:41.250
Now!

1018
01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:53.541
Don't you dare touch my-- Shit!

1019
01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:09.625
Eat the rubbers. Eat the damn rubbers.

1020
01:11:15.041 --> 01:11:18.500
If you hadn't crossed my path.
none of this woulda happened to me.

1021
01:11:19.083 --> 01:11:22.250
-Just so we're clear. no means no!
-I've had enough. feminazi!

1022
01:11:22.333 --> 01:11:24.833
-Don't touch her. asshole!
-What are you doing here?

1023
01:11:24.916 --> 01:11:26.583
-Sara's mine!
-Wait. you can walk?

1024
01:11:28.166 --> 01:11:30.000
We'll talk about this later. okay?

1025
01:11:30.083 --> 01:11:33.166
Mine! Mine!
When you gonna get this straight!

1026
01:11:36.666 --> 01:11:39.125
A vampire! A vampire!

1027
01:12:03.916 --> 01:12:06.541
We'll avenge the death
of those boys you killed years ago.

1028
01:12:06.625 --> 01:12:08.875
And also that dunce. Borja.

1029
01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:12.166
I've never killed anyone. I swear.
I'm not a murderer!

1030
01:12:13.041 --> 01:12:15.541
I hook up with girls
by promising to convert them.

1031
01:12:15.625 --> 01:12:16.916
We hang out. I drink some blood.

1032
01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.875
They're happy. a bit rundown.
just like mononucleosis. basically.

1033
01:12:19.958 --> 01:12:21.541
Ha! Samanthaxulita almost fell for it.

1034
01:12:21.625 --> 01:12:23.541
You told her the same thing
so you could kill her.

1035
01:12:23.625 --> 01:12:25.708
Do you know her? Ask her.

1036
01:12:25.791 --> 01:12:26.875
That's not necessary.

1037
01:12:27.833 --> 01:12:29.958
-Here she is. actually.
-Hm?

1038
01:12:32.041 --> 01:12:35.291
That was the only way I could contact
the vampire and see what he looked like.

1039
01:12:35.375 --> 01:12:36.416
So it was you?

1040
01:12:37.541 --> 01:12:40.791
-But if you're the girl that I met--
-Don't ever trust online chats.

1041
01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:42.875
Enough chitchatting.

1042
01:12:44.166 --> 01:12:47.583
Please. come on! You guys just said that.
I'm not Azrael. I'm Pelofrito.

1043
01:12:47.666 --> 01:12:50.416
I'm a poseur.
I don't even know how I turned into this.

1044
01:12:50.500 --> 01:12:52.625
No one can touch my Sara. No one.

1045
01:12:52.708 --> 01:12:55.166
On one. on two. and on…

1046
01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:56.750
Stop it!

1047
01:12:56.833 --> 01:12:59.833
-We have to call the police.
-No. I'll take care of this.

1048
01:12:59.916 --> 01:13:02.750
What do you mean. no?
They're probably the ones that sodomized…

1049
01:13:02.833 --> 01:13:04.083
…our poor Borja.

1050
01:13:04.166 --> 01:13:05.166
I told you…

1051
01:13:06.125 --> 01:13:07.958
I'll take care of it.

1052
01:13:10.458 --> 01:13:12.583
I will devour every bit of your being!

1053
01:13:12.666 --> 01:13:14.583
I should've sent you to a public school.

1054
01:13:17.458 --> 01:13:20.750
-The door! What the heck is that?!
-You. come here.

1055
01:13:20.833 --> 01:13:21.916
Push harder!

1056
01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.041
Now I'm going to kill you
like I intended so many years ago.

1057
01:13:25.125 --> 01:13:27.791
You turned me into this? Why?

1058
01:13:27.875 --> 01:13:30.291
Because
I was expecting you to seek revenge.

1059
01:13:30.375 --> 01:13:33.833
Hoping you would murder them.
But you've never had the guts to.

1060
01:13:33.916 --> 01:13:36.500
Of course!
"Azrael" is "Learza" spelled backwards.

1061
01:13:36.583 --> 01:13:37.875
She <i>is</i> Azrael!

1062
01:13:37.958 --> 01:13:41.166
A vampire that doesn't murder
is an aberration!

1063
01:13:42.250 --> 01:13:45.333
Stay away from my girlfriend.
you mon-sister!

1064
01:13:50.416 --> 01:13:53.125
You'll get soaked in holy w--
Jesus. there's two of them!

1065
01:13:53.208 --> 01:13:54.958
Get the nun!

1066
01:14:00.208 --> 01:14:02.458
-A condom?
-What do you expect? It's all I had!

1067
01:14:02.541 --> 01:14:04.666
My eyes! They burn!

1068
01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:06.125
My eyes!

1069
01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:08.666
I'm going to eviscerate your bodies.

1070
01:14:12.041 --> 01:14:14.875
-We need to get the hell out of here!
-No!

1071
01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:18.833
Borja didn't taste good.
but now I will feast!

1072
01:14:20.083 --> 01:14:21.416
We gotta get away!

1073
01:14:24.125 --> 01:14:25.333
What's bugging you. son?

1074
01:14:26.083 --> 01:14:28.958
It's no use trying to run away.
She knows us all.

1075
01:14:29.041 --> 01:14:31.166
So what? We'll go to the police.

1076
01:14:31.666 --> 01:14:34.000
They'll think we're crazy.
I already tried.

1077
01:14:35.208 --> 01:14:38.000
If we find a way out.
she'll hunt us down one by one.

1078
01:14:40.583 --> 01:14:42.500
We've gotta kill her while she's weak.

1079
01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.666
Really? But that idiot's stakes
are no use.

1080
01:14:47.125 --> 01:14:48.125
I know.

1081
01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:50.875
That's why we need more weapons.

1082
01:14:52.708 --> 01:14:54.250
Go. go. go. go!

1083
01:14:55.041 --> 01:14:57.333
Shit. There's no holy water left.

1084
01:14:57.416 --> 01:14:59.500
We used it all up
with the whole condom thing.

1085
01:14:59.583 --> 01:15:00.791
Now you tell me.

1086
01:15:01.916 --> 01:15:05.166
Let's find anything that's been blessed
that might weaken that creature. Let's go.

1087
01:15:05.250 --> 01:15:06.083
Let's go.

1088
01:15:06.166 --> 01:15:09.291
You always mess things up. Manu!
This is all your fault!

1089
01:15:09.375 --> 01:15:10.375
Look who's talking now!

1090
01:15:10.458 --> 01:15:14.000
Wait. hold on! So now you…
now you're walking. is that right?

1091
01:15:14.083 --> 01:15:16.000
Well. I can explain. It's very simple.

1092
01:15:16.083 --> 01:15:19.083
I had sprained my ankle when Sara met me.
and she thought I was disabled. okay?

1093
01:15:19.916 --> 01:15:20.916
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1094
01:15:23.166 --> 01:15:26.250
Thing is. you were so kind
I just couldn't tell you the truth.

1095
01:15:26.333 --> 01:15:28.458
But you and I can still be besties. right?

1096
01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:31.000
Come on. enough chitchat.
We gotta kill Azrael.

1097
01:15:31.083 --> 01:15:34.791
-You mean. the real Azrael.
-Why did you pretend you were Azrael?

1098
01:15:35.375 --> 01:15:37.666
Do you know what it's like
to be a teenager forever?

1099
01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.083
In movies like <i>HollyBlood </i>it seems cool.

1100
01:15:42.625 --> 01:15:45.875
But you realize you can't open up
a bank account or rent an apartment.

1101
01:15:46.375 --> 01:15:48.208
You get crappy jobs and crappy pay.

1102
01:15:48.291 --> 01:15:51.333
If you can find the vampire
that changed you and then murder him.

1103
01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:52.541
you can be human again.

1104
01:15:52.625 --> 01:15:54.750
That's right. This is technically correct.

1105
01:15:57.333 --> 01:15:59.291
I found out about
the legend of Azrael.

1106
01:15:59.375 --> 01:16:02.291
Then I heard about Borja
on the Facebook group for alumni.

1107
01:16:02.375 --> 01:16:05.500
I realized that the creature that
changed me was at our high school.

1108
01:16:06.250 --> 01:16:07.333
But apparently.

1109
01:16:07.833 --> 01:16:09.000
she's always been here.

1110
01:16:09.083 --> 01:16:10.208
Of course!

1111
01:16:10.958 --> 01:16:13.000
That's why we have
the annual blood drive at school.

1112
01:16:13.083 --> 01:16:14.708
Then why did she murder Borja?

1113
01:16:16.291 --> 01:16:19.333
Because it's important
to maintain some good habits.

1114
01:16:20.666 --> 01:16:21.583
Help them!

1115
01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:32.500
Who votes for Pelofrito going out there
and getting rid of that monster?

1116
01:16:32.583 --> 01:16:34.375
-Yes.
-No fucking way!

1117
01:16:34.458 --> 01:16:37.083
It would take an army of vampires
to get rid of that creature.

1118
01:16:38.041 --> 01:16:38.875
Exactly!

1119
01:16:38.958 --> 01:16:41.500
If we drink your blood. we'll change.
and we can beat her together.

1120
01:16:41.583 --> 01:16:44.125
-It'll take more than two of you.
-Count me out of this. guys.

1121
01:16:44.208 --> 01:16:46.208
I took an oath as a vampire slayer.
so I can't.

1122
01:16:46.291 --> 01:16:48.208
Watch out! Here she comes!

1123
01:16:48.291 --> 01:16:49.416
Take this.

1124
01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.041
I will have you all soon!

1125
01:16:56.541 --> 01:16:59.875
-I have all eternity!
-Who wants to go first?

1126
01:17:02.541 --> 01:17:05.041
You'll come out eventually.

1127
01:17:05.125 --> 01:17:06.250
you rats!

1128
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.958
If we kill a nun. will we burn in hell?

1129
01:17:27.041 --> 01:17:30.208
Don't worry about it.
Three Lord's Prayers and all is forgiven.

1130
01:17:30.291 --> 01:17:32.041
You bunch of amateurs.

1131
01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:42.083
You're going to pay
for everything you've done to us!

1132
01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:47.750
She's flying away!

1133
01:17:49.083 --> 01:17:50.250
She's mine!

1134
01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:52.708
Let me go!

1135
01:17:52.791 --> 01:17:54.541
Think. Think.

1136
01:17:54.625 --> 01:17:56.750
Holy water's
the only thing that harms her.

1137
01:17:56.833 --> 01:17:58.625
I gotta pee. then. In the pool!

1138
01:17:58.708 --> 01:18:00.833
Pelofrito made me drink balloons of water.

1139
01:18:00.916 --> 01:18:03.666
so. technically. my urine is holy water.

1140
01:18:03.750 --> 01:18:06.583
We need to get her to the pool! Grab her!

1141
01:18:06.666 --> 01:18:07.666
Come on!

1142
01:18:12.125 --> 01:18:13.916
Let me go. Let me go!

1143
01:18:22.083 --> 01:18:26.541
When I'm done with you.
I'll go after your families.

1144
01:18:26.625 --> 01:18:28.666
-Come on!
-I can't when people are watching.

1145
01:18:33.416 --> 01:18:36.291
Yeah!

1146
01:18:38.208 --> 01:18:40.333
The water in the pool
has now been blessed!

1147
01:18:40.416 --> 01:18:41.916
Throw her in!

1148
01:18:46.958 --> 01:18:48.625
It burns!

1149
01:18:57.250 --> 01:18:58.750
What is going on here?

1150
01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.000
She's transformed.

1151
01:19:15.083 --> 01:19:16.708
Into a hottie.

1152
01:19:16.791 --> 01:19:19.208
What are you doing?
Push her in. We have to kill her.

1153
01:19:19.291 --> 01:19:22.583
Yes. but we should let the girl
explain herself first. right?

1154
01:19:24.916 --> 01:19:26.458
Papa. Manu. you guys. wake up!

1155
01:19:26.541 --> 01:19:29.458
Yeah. sure. It's easy for you
because you're in love. but--

1156
01:19:29.541 --> 01:19:30.750
Hey. are you cold or something?

1157
01:19:30.833 --> 01:19:32.500
If you let me go.

1158
01:19:33.416 --> 01:19:34.625
we'll have some fun.

1159
01:19:34.708 --> 01:19:36.416
She's using mind control!

1160
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:38.916
Carmen! Help me!

1161
01:19:45.291 --> 01:19:46.750
The Lidia you knew online

1162
01:19:48.541 --> 01:19:49.750
really does exist.

1163
01:19:50.708 --> 01:19:51.916
and she's in front of you.

1164
01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:56.250
I'm sorry.

1165
01:20:19.625 --> 01:20:20.500
My God!

1166
01:20:41.916 --> 01:20:43.125
Oh my God. I'm human.

1167
01:20:43.208 --> 01:20:44.041
Javi!

1168
01:20:44.958 --> 01:20:45.791
Javi!

1169
01:20:48.416 --> 01:20:49.666
We're human again.

1170
01:20:51.041 --> 01:20:52.041
Javi!

1171
01:20:53.875 --> 01:20:55.583
Javi!

1172
01:20:58.291 --> 01:20:59.500
Javi!

1173
01:21:06.833 --> 01:21:08.083
Holy crap!

1174
01:21:21.916 --> 01:21:23.291
He's all right?

1175
01:21:23.375 --> 01:21:24.375
Yoo-hoo.

1176
01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:31.958
Oh. son! Oh!

1177
01:21:33.166 --> 01:21:34.500
You scared me.

1178
01:21:35.666 --> 01:21:36.666
I'm sorry.

1179
01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:40.958
Whoo! For a minute.
I really thought that was it. huh?

1180
01:21:41.041 --> 01:21:44.250
I'm so glad you're back.
Because we have unfinished business.

1181
01:21:48.708 --> 01:21:50.833
I may well become a Buddhist.

1182
01:21:59.583 --> 01:22:01.125
Whoo!

1183
01:22:25.875 --> 01:22:28.208
Do we really
have to watch this movie again?

1184
01:22:31.875 --> 01:22:34.708
Honestly. I think this is
the worst thing I've ever seen.

1185
01:22:35.208 --> 01:22:36.958
Except for that vampire nun. right?

1186
01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.125
No way. This is much worse.

1187
01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:44.375
At least here
they can only die of severe pneumonia.
