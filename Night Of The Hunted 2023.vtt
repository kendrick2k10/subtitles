00:22:42.084 --> 00:22:43.879
Please answer.

183
00:22:48.539 --> 00:22:50.403
Hello? Can you hear me?

184
00:22:55.615 --> 00:22:59.412
Hello? If there's anyone
out there. please answer.

185
00:22:59.412 --> 00:23:01.034
<i>I'm right here.</i>

186
00:23:03.658 --> 00:23:05.591
Fuck.

187
00:23:07.558 --> 00:23:10.423
<i>Just me and you.</i>

188
00:23:10.423 --> 00:23:12.529
<i>Oh. yeah.</i>

189
00:23:12.529 --> 00:23:14.496
<i>And my wife...</i>

190
00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:18.500
<i>Amelia.</i>

191
00:23:41.799 --> 00:23:42.835
Oh. my God.

192
00:23:42.835 --> 00:23:45.976
Oh! Oh. my God.

193
00:23:45.976 --> 00:23:50.152
<i>So hard to think of her
with another man.</i>

194
00:23:50.152 --> 00:23:52.051
Did I treat her poorly?

195
00:23:54.536 --> 00:23:56.676
<i>Abuse her physically?</i>

196
00:23:58.713 --> 00:24:00.473
<i>Did I abuse her emotionally?</i>

197
00:24:00.473 --> 00:24:02.924
<i>Or is everything abusive
these days?</i>

198
00:24:05.202 --> 00:24:07.894
<i>Did I not provide?</i>

199
00:24:07.894 --> 00:24:11.173
<i>No.</i>

200
00:24:11.173 --> 00:24:13.555
<i>She was probably just bored.</i>

201
00:24:15.799 --> 00:24:18.077
<i>Tell me.</i>

202
00:24:18.077 --> 00:24:19.975
<i>Are you bored. Alice?</i>

203
00:24:19.975 --> 00:24:22.771
I need a phone.

204
00:24:22.771 --> 00:24:24.083
Her phone?

205
00:24:41.169 --> 00:24:43.033
Fuck.

206
00:24:46.692 --> 00:24:48.625
<i>That's okay.</i>

207
00:24:50.765 --> 00:24:52.732
<i>You don't have to answer.</i>

208
00:24:56.805 --> 00:24:58.980
<i>We can take our time.</i>

209
00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:02.846
<i>What I know for sure though</i>

210
00:25:02.846 --> 00:25:05.227
<i>is that we're not
going anywhere</i>

211
00:25:05.227 --> 00:25:08.645
<i>till we're figure this out.</i>

212
00:25:08.645 --> 00:25:11.061
Fuck!

213
00:25:18.896 --> 00:25:20.657
Shit.

214
00:25:30.149 --> 00:25:31.909
Fuck.

215
00:27:00.722 --> 00:27:06.245
Fuck.

216
00:27:07.246 --> 00:27:09.766
<i>We seem to be stuck.
you and me.</i>

217
00:27:11.353 --> 00:27:17.083
<i>Cowering on the floor of
a dark and dirty gas station.</i>

218
00:27:17.083 --> 00:27:18.878
<i>What a waste.</i>

219
00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:24.712
<i>If you're not interested
in saving yourself...</i>

220
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.302
<i>well. then. this is
how it all ends.</i>

221
00:27:38.864 --> 00:27:41.798
I've never done anything to you.

222
00:27:41.798 --> 00:27:45.249
<i>Are you sure about that?</i>

223
00:27:45.249 --> 00:27:46.768
Who are you?

224
00:27:46.768 --> 00:27:49.322
<i>Who do you think I am?</i>

225
00:27:49.322 --> 00:27:51.946
<i>And more importantly...</i>

226
00:27:51.946 --> 00:27:54.189
<i>who the fuck do you think
you are?</i>

227
00:28:00.437 --> 00:28:02.232
<i>Alice?</i>

228
00:28:10.067 --> 00:28:12.760
<i>Come out.</i>

229
00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.832
<i>And I promise
you'll hardly feel a thing.</i>

230
00:28:17.178 --> 00:28:20.491
<i>One shot and all our problems
will be over.</i>

231
00:28:23.287 --> 00:28:25.289
Oh. fuck.

232
00:29:01.153 --> 00:29:03.776
Fuck.

233
00:31:38.482 --> 00:31:40.277
Amelia?

234
00:31:42.762 --> 00:31:43.729
Holy shit!

235
00:31:43.729 --> 00:31:45.351
Get down!

236
00:31:45.351 --> 00:31:46.732
What?
Get out of the doorway!

237
00:31:46.732 --> 00:31:49.079
There's someone
shooting in the store!

238
00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:51.530
What?

239
00:31:51.530 --> 00:31:53.083
Amelia?

240
00:31:53.083 --> 00:31:54.982
Where is Amelia.
the girl who works here?

241
00:31:54.982 --> 00:31:57.363
You need to call the police!

242
00:31:57.363 --> 00:31:59.641
Amelia?

243
00:31:59.641 --> 00:32:03.093
Where the hell is she?

244
00:32:03.093 --> 00:32:05.371
She's dead.
What the fuck?

245
00:32:05.371 --> 00:32:06.752
What the fuck?

246
00:32:06.752 --> 00:32:08.547
Listen to me.

247
00:32:08.547 --> 00:32:11.205
You need to call the police.

248
00:32:11.205 --> 00:32:13.172
Do you have your phone?

249
00:32:15.623 --> 00:32:17.487
Yeah.

250
00:32:17.487 --> 00:32:19.316
Good.

251
00:32:22.285 --> 00:32:24.770
Fuck. Shit.

252
00:32:24.770 --> 00:32:27.566
It's in the car.

253
00:32:27.566 --> 00:32:30.017
Fuck.

254
00:32:30.017 --> 00:32:32.019
Where are you?

255
00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:37.196
I'm behind the counter.

256
00:32:37.196 --> 00:32:40.303
If you go towards the
refrigerator. you can see me.

257
00:32:49.588 --> 00:32:51.555
What the hell happened?

258
00:32:51.555 --> 00:32:55.352
I just walked in here
and someone shot me.

259
00:32:55.352 --> 00:32:56.629
Where is Amelia?

260
00:32:56.629 --> 00:33:00.254
She's right here.
She's right here with me.

261
00:33:00.254 --> 00:33:01.738
Are you hurt bad?

262
00:33:01.738 --> 00:33:03.671
I don't know.
I don't know. It's my arm.

263
00:33:03.671 --> 00:33:05.155
You don't have a phone?

264
00:33:05.155 --> 00:33:07.019
No. and I can't find hers either.

265
00:33:07.019 --> 00:33:08.572
- What about the landline...
- No.

266
00:33:08.572 --> 00:33:09.642
...on the counter?

267
00:33:09.642 --> 00:33:11.575
It's not working. nothing is.

268
00:33:11.575 --> 00:33:13.198
Nothing is working.

269
00:33:13.198 --> 00:33:14.716
It's impossible to move around.

270
00:33:14.716 --> 00:33:16.304
He--
He can see everything.

271
00:33:16.304 --> 00:33:17.616
Where's he shooting from?

272
00:33:17.616 --> 00:33:18.789
I think he's shooting

273
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:20.481
from the billboard
across the road.

274
00:33:20.481 --> 00:33:21.723
but there's an another door.

275
00:33:21.723 --> 00:33:24.002
I saw it
in the security monitor.

276
00:33:27.867 --> 00:33:30.836
The door to the garage.

277
00:33:30.836 --> 00:33:32.389
But that's locked at night.

278
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:34.529
Well. is there a key?

279
00:33:34.529 --> 00:33:37.118
What the f...
What the fuck?

280
00:33:37.118 --> 00:33:39.051
What the fuck. man?
What the fuck?

281
00:33:39.051 --> 00:33:40.846
Hey. hey. listen to me.

282
00:33:40.846 --> 00:33:42.503
We need to stay calm. okay?

283
00:33:42.503 --> 00:33:43.711
We need to flag someone down.

284
00:33:43.711 --> 00:33:45.747
No one uses this road at night.

285
00:33:45.747 --> 00:33:48.267
Yeah. but you did.

286
00:33:48.267 --> 00:33:50.235
You think he's still out there?

287
00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:55.412
I don't know. He...

288
00:33:55.412 --> 00:33:58.553
He hasn't fire a shot
since you...

289
00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:14.259
Amelia...

290
00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:19.126
No. no. no. no.

291
00:34:19.126 --> 00:34:20.575
Oh. my God.

292
00:34:28.687 --> 00:34:31.586
She was such a good person.

293
00:34:36.729 --> 00:34:42.114
This is so fucked up.

294
00:35:06.449 --> 00:35:08.278
The only reason
she was working here

295
00:35:08.278 --> 00:35:10.280
was to help out her parents.

296
00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.903
They came from Mexico city
and bought this place.

297
00:35:12.903 --> 00:35:14.284
and then her mom got sick.

298
00:35:14.284 --> 00:35:17.391
- He said she was his wife.
- What?

299
00:35:17.391 --> 00:35:21.533
He said that he shot her
because she left him.

300
00:35:21.533 --> 00:35:23.638
Who?

301
00:35:23.638 --> 00:35:27.435
You talked to the guy
who did this?

302
00:35:27.435 --> 00:35:28.885
How?

303
00:35:28.885 --> 00:35:30.680
On that walkie.

304
00:35:34.270 --> 00:35:35.961
He said that she was his wife!

305
00:35:35.961 --> 00:35:38.619
No. he's-- he's lying.
That's not true.

306
00:35:38.619 --> 00:35:40.552
How do I know
that you're not lying?

307
00:35:42.899 --> 00:35:44.659
What do you mean?

308
00:35:47.524 --> 00:35:49.250
I'm being shot at all night.

309
00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:51.183
and the moment that you
get here. it all stops.

310
00:35:51.183 --> 00:35:53.599
Whoa. whoa. whoa.
wait a minute. Wait a minute.

311
00:35:53.599 --> 00:35:55.774
You think that I did this?
Hold on.

312
00:35:55.774 --> 00:35:57.569
Don't move!
Stay were you are!

313
00:35:57.569 --> 00:35:58.811
Stay away from me!

314
00:35:58.811 --> 00:36:01.228
Just calm down.

315
00:36:01.228 --> 00:36:05.301
This is crazy. okay?

316
00:36:05.301 --> 00:36:07.510
Then why are you
showing up at 3:00 AM?

317
00:36:07.510 --> 00:36:11.548
Because we both work
graveyard shifts.

318
00:36:11.548 --> 00:36:13.757
Sometimes I would come
in between deliveries

319
00:36:13.757 --> 00:36:15.552
and we would just...

320
00:36:18.831 --> 00:36:21.006
We would just talk.

321
00:36:21.006 --> 00:36:27.702
This country is so fucked up.

322
00:36:27.702 --> 00:36:29.773
Fucking racists.

323
00:36:29.773 --> 00:36:31.706
Guns everywhere.

324
00:36:31.706 --> 00:36:34.571
I can't take it anymore.

325
00:36:37.022 --> 00:36:40.577
And it's always innocent people
who get caught up in this shit.

326
00:36:43.718 --> 00:36:47.239
You don't-- You don't--
You don't believe me?

327
00:36:47.239 --> 00:36:49.621
Okay. fine. talk to him. then.

328
00:36:49.621 --> 00:36:52.279
You'll see.

329
00:36:52.279 --> 00:36:53.452
Go ahead.

330
00:36:53.452 --> 00:36:54.971
Tell him that I called the cops.

331
00:36:54.971 --> 00:36:57.387
He doesn't know I left my phone
in the car. right?

332
00:37:17.511 --> 00:37:19.306
We called the police.

333
00:37:19.306 --> 00:37:21.100
They're on their way.

334
00:37:24.966 --> 00:37:26.727
Try again.

335
00:37:30.524 --> 00:37:32.457
Did you hear what I said?

336
00:37:32.457 --> 00:37:33.837
We called the cops.

337
00:37:33.837 --> 00:37:35.736
You better
get the hell out of here.

338
00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:40.844
Try again.

339
00:37:40.844 --> 00:37:42.639
Please.

340
00:37:49.784 --> 00:37:52.442
Maybe he's gone. Yeah?

341
00:37:52.442 --> 00:37:54.410
- Go get your phone. then.
- What?

342
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:55.790
Yeah. if he's gone.
go get your phone.

343
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:57.896
No. I mean. I'm not gonna
go get myself shot

344
00:37:57.896 --> 00:38:00.001
just to prove
I'm not some fucking terrorist.

345
00:38:00.001 --> 00:38:03.315
I'm telling you. this is not me!

346
00:38:03.315 --> 00:38:05.731
I could never do anything
like this.

347
00:38:31.999 --> 00:38:34.001
I see it.

348
00:38:34.001 --> 00:38:35.934
My phone.

349
00:38:38.523 --> 00:38:41.008
Well. do you think
you can get it?

350
00:38:41.008 --> 00:38:42.630
Maybe if I...

351
00:38:42.630 --> 00:38:46.116
Maybe if I go around the shelves
to the other side.

352
00:38:46.116 --> 00:38:47.497
Yeah.

353
00:38:47.497 --> 00:38:49.085
You can use the car as a shield.

354
00:38:50.949 --> 00:38:53.054
Yeah. sure.

355
00:38:53.054 --> 00:38:54.884
Let's do it.

356
00:39:03.513 --> 00:39:06.447
Maybe we should just wait
a few-- maybe a little bit.

357
00:39:06.447 --> 00:39:07.931
The truckers start arriving
in a few hours.

358
00:39:07.931 --> 00:39:10.624
No. no. this is important.
This is the only way.

359
00:39:12.488 --> 00:39:14.697
You need to call for help. okay?

360
00:39:14.697 --> 00:39:17.182
Are you insane?
I'm not going across there

361
00:39:17.182 --> 00:39:18.770
and get my fucking head
blown off.

362
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:20.047
If you're telling the truth.

363
00:39:20.047 --> 00:39:21.600
he's gonna be down here
any second.

364
00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.602
You need to call for help.

365
00:39:28.573 --> 00:39:30.506
I can distract him.

366
00:39:32.439 --> 00:39:33.888
How?

367
00:39:33.888 --> 00:39:35.614
There's a flashlight
under the counter.

368
00:40:01.157 --> 00:40:02.745
Okay.

369
00:41:39.048 --> 00:41:41.775
<i>You know the difference
between you and that guy?</i>

370
00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:46.987
<i>He was willing
to sacrifice himself...</i>

371
00:41:52.717 --> 00:41:54.650
<i>...while you survive.</i>

372
00:41:58.619 --> 00:42:00.863
<i>You put him up to it.
didn't you?</i>

373
00:42:06.593 --> 00:42:08.905
<i>What kind of a person
does that?</i>

374
00:42:12.322 --> 00:42:13.945
<i>Then again...</i>

375
00:42:13.945 --> 00:42:16.741
<i>what kind of person
does what I'm doing?</i>

376
00:42:28.718 --> 00:42:31.756
<i>I guess we both have a lot
to think about. huh?</i>

377
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:36.070
<i>The way we've lived...</i>

378
00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:46.771
<i>The repercussions
of our actions...</i>

379
00:42:52.017 --> 00:42:53.916
<i>Who we've become.</i>

380
00:43:28.847 --> 00:43:30.780
Why are you doing this?

381
00:43:32.713 --> 00:43:35.440
<i>For the truth.</i>

382
00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:37.235
<i>Because I need the truth.</i>

383
00:43:42.343 --> 00:43:46.037
You sure tell a lot of lies for
someone looking for the truth.

384
00:43:46.037 --> 00:43:48.073
<i>Do I?</i>

385
00:43:48.073 --> 00:43:50.213
<i>And what about you?</i>

386
00:43:50.213 --> 00:43:52.215
<i>You were at the convention.
right?</i>

387
00:43:54.045 --> 00:43:58.290
I work for a pharmaceutical
company. so...

388
00:43:58.290 --> 00:44:01.362
<i>So...</i>

389
00:44:01.362 --> 00:44:03.157
<i>you're a drug dealer.</i>

390
00:44:08.818 --> 00:44:10.406
That's very original.

391
00:44:10.406 --> 00:44:13.996
<i>You know how many people
lost sons. daughters</i>

392
00:44:13.996 --> 00:44:15.342
<i>because of you?</i>

393
00:44:15.342 --> 00:44:18.966
<i>Your drugs.
your bullshit vaccines.</i>

394
00:44:18.966 --> 00:44:20.692
Fucking idiot.

395
00:44:20.692 --> 00:44:23.453
<i>All so that
you can get rich...</i>

396
00:44:23.453 --> 00:44:26.284
<i>with zero accountability. ever.</i>
- Sure.

397
00:44:26.284 --> 00:44:29.770
Do you know how many fucking
people's lives we've saved?

398
00:44:29.770 --> 00:44:31.738
<i>You think someone might
want you dead for that?</i>

399
00:44:31.738 --> 00:44:33.498
<i>But no. no. no.</i>

400
00:44:33.498 --> 00:44:36.018
<i>Instead. let's focus on
the microchips</i>

401
00:44:36.018 --> 00:44:38.814
<i>and Bill Gates
and all the anti-vaxxers</i>

402
00:44:38.814 --> 00:44:42.162
<i>so we all sound crazy
so you can censor us.</i>

403
00:44:42.162 --> 00:44:44.474
<i>So we can never talk about
what's actually going on.</i>

404
00:44:44.474 --> 00:44:46.822
What the fuck are you
talking about?

405
00:44:46.822 --> 00:44:48.962
<i>I'm talking about
the truth!</i>

406
00:44:48.962 --> 00:44:50.826
Yeah?

407
00:44:50.826 --> 00:44:54.968
<i>But you'd rather label us
so you can control us?</i>

408
00:44:54.968 --> 00:44:57.798
<i>You think someone might
want you dead for that?</i>

409
00:44:57.798 --> 00:44:59.248
<i>Do you?</i>
- Are you finished?

410
00:44:59.248 --> 00:45:01.043
Can I talk?

411
00:45:03.252 --> 00:45:05.875
I'm a VP of Marketing.

412
00:45:05.875 --> 00:45:07.221
Social media. okay?

413
00:45:07.221 --> 00:45:09.430
I don't make the stuff.

414
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:12.986
<i>Oh. that's even worse.</i>

415
00:45:12.986 --> 00:45:15.782
<i>You promote it.</i>

416
00:45:15.782 --> 00:45:19.544
<i>You create the image.</i>

417
00:45:19.544 --> 00:45:22.271
<i>Filling young minds
with lies and deceit.</i>

418
00:45:22.271 --> 00:45:24.238
<i>Marching them to their deaths.</i>

419
00:45:32.039 --> 00:45:34.007
<i>How many people did you
have to step on</i>

420
00:45:34.007 --> 00:45:36.388
<i>to get such an important job?</i>

421
00:45:40.185 --> 00:45:44.880
<i>How many years
did you have to put in</i>

422
00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:48.262
<i>before you became
Vice President of Marketing...</i>

423
00:45:51.541 --> 00:45:53.923
<i>...at Phinzer Pharmaceuticals?</i>

424
00:45:57.962 --> 00:45:59.929
<i>I'll tell you how long.</i>

425
00:46:01.931 --> 00:46:05.176
<i>Two years.</i>

426
00:46:05.176 --> 00:46:08.075
<i>and you became VP</i>

427
00:46:08.075 --> 00:46:12.148
<i>of one of the biggest
drug companies in the country.</i>

428
00:46:14.633 --> 00:46:16.428
<i>God. that's amazing.</i>

429
00:46:19.259 --> 00:46:21.502
<i>I bet you didn't even have to
sleep with anyone</i>

430
00:46:21.502 --> 00:46:23.297
<i>to get ahead.</i>

431
00:46:28.302 --> 00:46:30.201
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

432
00:46:30.201 --> 00:46:33.100
<i>You don't need to sleep with
anyone to get ahead anymore.</i>

433
00:46:33.100 --> 00:46:34.308
Fuck you.

434
00:46:34.308 --> 00:46:35.965
<i>You can just accuse someone</i>

435
00:46:35.965 --> 00:46:38.588
<i>for something they did
when they were 12</i>

436
00:46:38.588 --> 00:46:42.592
<i>or a picture in blackface.</i>

437
00:46:42.592 --> 00:46:46.873
<i>Or maybe a boss came in one day</i>

438
00:46:46.873 --> 00:46:49.116
<i>and told you
how pretty you looked.</i>

439
00:46:51.636 --> 00:46:54.950
<i>Next thing you know.
he's gone.</i>

440
00:46:54.950 --> 00:46:56.365
<i>just like that!</i>

441
00:46:56.365 --> 00:46:58.125
<i>Piece of shit.</i>

442
00:46:58.125 --> 00:47:00.127
<i>Pig.</i>

443
00:47:02.267 --> 00:47:06.202
<i>Just because he said something
nice to a woman with ambition.</i>

444
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:15.384
<i>Now he's out of a job.</i>

445
00:47:19.664 --> 00:47:21.942
<i>Can't make his house payments.</i>

446
00:47:25.118 --> 00:47:28.017
<i>And he can't take care of--</i>

447
00:47:28.017 --> 00:47:31.331
<i>of his little girl.</i>

448
00:47:31.331 --> 00:47:33.885
<i>You don't know what it's like
to hear a child</i>

449
00:47:33.885 --> 00:47:37.164
<i>screaming in the middle
of the night.</i>

450
00:47:37.164 --> 00:47:40.236
<i>To wait for hours
in the emergency room...</i>

451
00:47:46.967 --> 00:47:49.314
<i>...because her daddy.</i>

452
00:47:49.314 --> 00:47:52.076
<i>who's supposed to protect her.</i>

453
00:47:52.076 --> 00:47:55.010
<i>has no health insurance</i>

454
00:47:55.010 --> 00:47:58.323
<i>and is so...</i>

455
00:47:58.323 --> 00:48:01.154
<i>fucking helpless.</i>

456
00:48:06.435 --> 00:48:09.058
<i>You think that guy
might want you to kill you?</i>

457
00:48:13.614 --> 00:48:16.410
<i>You think that guy
might want you dead?</i>

458
00:48:18.585 --> 00:48:21.105
<i>All these deaths...</i>

459
00:48:21.105 --> 00:48:23.038
<i>could have been avoided.</i>

460
00:48:25.454 --> 00:48:29.044
<i>Because someone has to pay.</i>

461
00:48:29.044 --> 00:48:31.322
<i>Someone always has to pay.</i>

462
00:48:37.259 --> 00:48:40.503
<i>I'm tired of playing games.</i>

463
00:48:40.503 --> 00:48:43.644
<i>But all you wanna do</i>

464
00:48:43.644 --> 00:48:45.267
<i>is play hide and seek.</i>

465
00:48:52.343 --> 00:48:56.450
<i>One Mississippi.
two Mississippi.</i>

466
00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:58.245
<i>three Mississippi.</i>

467
00:48:58.245 --> 00:49:01.386
<i>four Mississippi.
five Mississippi.</i>

468
00:49:01.386 --> 00:49:02.698
<i>Who is Alice?</i>

469
00:49:02.698 --> 00:49:05.977
<i>Six Mississippi.
seven Mississippi.</i>

470
00:49:05.977 --> 00:49:08.359
<i>What did she do?
Eight Mississippi.</i>

471
00:49:08.359 --> 00:49:11.569
<i>Admit it. Alice.
Nine Mississippi.</i>

472
00:49:11.569 --> 00:49:13.329
<i>Ten Mississippi.</i>

473
00:49:13.329 --> 00:49:14.986
<i>Ready or not. here I--</i>

474
00:49:24.789 --> 00:49:27.585
<i>You don't get to
hijack this country</i>

475
00:49:27.585 --> 00:49:29.414
<i>and hide behind your lies</i>

476
00:49:29.414 --> 00:49:34.488
<i>and your fake news
and your forced mandates!</i>

477
00:49:34.488 --> 00:49:36.421
Please don't do this.

478
00:49:36.421 --> 00:49:39.666
<i>I'm not doing anything you
haven't been doing for years.</i>

479
00:49:48.813 --> 00:49:50.780
I never killed anybody.

480
00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:52.506
<i>Yes. you have.</i>

481
00:49:52.506 --> 00:49:55.061
<i>That's the whole point.
We're the same.</i>

482
00:49:55.061 --> 00:49:58.029
<i>We kill to protect
our interests.</i>

483
00:49:58.029 --> 00:50:01.446
<i>I'm just not blind to it
like you are.</i>

484
00:50:01.446 --> 00:50:03.034
We're nothing alike.

485
00:50:03.034 --> 00:50:05.588
<i>Oh. of course.</i>

486
00:50:05.588 --> 00:50:07.832
<i>You're woke.</i>

487
00:50:07.832 --> 00:50:09.558
<i>and I'm a psychopath.</i>

488
00:50:09.558 --> 00:50:13.044
<i>How convenient for you.</i>

489
00:50:13.044 --> 00:50:14.701
I never said that.

490
00:50:14.701 --> 00:50:17.635
<i>No.
But you wanted to.</i>

491
00:50:17.635 --> 00:50:20.465
<i>And yet. when I was sent
to Afghanistan</i>

492
00:50:20.465 --> 00:50:23.434
<i>and I was killing for you.
it was okay.</i>

493
00:50:23.434 --> 00:50:26.540
<i>When my friends died thousands
of miles away from home</i>

494
00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:29.095
<i>while the were killing for you.
it was okay.</i>

495
00:50:29.095 --> 00:50:30.786
<i>But now that you are forced</i>

496
00:50:30.786 --> 00:50:32.650
<i>to face the consequences
of your life.</i>

497
00:50:32.650 --> 00:50:35.618
<i>it's so much easier
for you to label me</i>

498
00:50:35.618 --> 00:50:37.689
<i>than it is for you
to face reality.</i>

499
00:51:00.678 --> 00:51:04.544
<i>But until you recognize
your part in all this.</i>

500
00:51:04.544 --> 00:51:07.892
<i>you'll never understand
why people like me exist.</i>

501
00:51:07.892 --> 00:51:09.445
<i>And we do.</i>

502
00:51:09.445 --> 00:51:11.102
<i>And there's a lot of us.</i>

503
00:51:11.102 --> 00:51:13.829
<i>You could be at school.
in the supermarket.</i>

504
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:17.350
<i>at work. or even. uh...</i>

505
00:51:17.350 --> 00:51:20.836
<i>filling up your car
at a gas station.</i>

506
00:51:20.836 --> 00:51:22.251
<i>You wouldn't even
see it coming.</i>

507
00:51:22.251 --> 00:51:24.115
<i>and then suddenly...</i>

508
00:51:24.115 --> 00:51:25.737
<i>you're dead.</i>

509
00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:30.397
Why am I even talking to you?

510
00:51:30.397 --> 00:51:33.642
<i>Oh. because you want to
know who I am.</i>

511
00:51:33.642 --> 00:51:35.540
<i>And because you know
that every second</i>

512
00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:38.129
<i>I'm engaged in
this conversation</i>

513
00:51:38.129 --> 00:51:40.166
<i>is another second
I'm not coming down there</i>

514
00:51:40.166 --> 00:51:43.928
<i>to spill your brains
on that filthy linoleum floor.</i>

515
00:51:46.482 --> 00:51:49.865
Fuck.

516
00:51:59.185 --> 00:52:01.877
Get out. Get out.

517
00:52:10.817 --> 00:52:13.233
Fuck.

518
00:52:13.233 --> 00:52:15.270
Fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck. fuck.

519
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:17.513
Fuck!

520
00:52:20.482 --> 00:52:23.381
Fuck!

521
00:52:23.381 --> 00:52:25.625
What the fuck. man?

522
00:52:25.625 --> 00:52:27.316
What's the hell?

523
00:52:27.316 --> 00:52:29.318
Get out of here.

524
00:52:51.996 --> 00:52:54.205
<i>See?</i>

525
00:52:54.205 --> 00:52:56.587
<i>Would a psychopath
have let him go?</i>

526
00:52:59.521 --> 00:53:02.765
<i>Although. if that guy had
better credit. he'd be dead.</i>

527
00:53:08.254 --> 00:53:10.359
<i>See what we've been reduced to?</i>

528
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:29.482
You're not a bad guy. You...

529
00:53:29.482 --> 00:53:32.588
Otherwise. you wouldn't
have let him go.

530
00:53:32.588 --> 00:53:34.521
<i>Oh. yeah?</i>

531
00:53:34.521 --> 00:53:37.317
<i>How many likes do you think
that will get me?</i>

532
00:53:41.666 --> 00:53:43.496
There's something
you should know about me.

533
00:53:43.496 --> 00:53:46.671
Something you wouldn't find out
on social media.

534
00:53:46.671 --> 00:53:48.432
<i>I'm listening.</i>

535
00:53:48.432 --> 00:53:50.434
We're trying
to have a baby.

536
00:53:52.712 --> 00:53:55.404
<i>And yet here you are
traveling with your lover</i>

537
00:53:55.404 --> 00:53:57.648
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

538
00:53:57.648 --> 00:54:00.409
<i>How could you ever have time
for children?</i>

539
00:54:00.409 --> 00:54:04.724
<i>No. you don't strike me
as the maternal type.</i>

540
00:54:04.724 --> 00:54:07.934
<i>You couldn't handle
the commitment.</i>

541
00:54:07.934 --> 00:54:09.729
<i>The pain.</i>

542
00:54:13.905 --> 00:54:15.769
You know nothing about me.

543
00:54:18.427 --> 00:54:20.740
<i>I know you
more than you think.</i>

544
00:54:23.536 --> 00:54:26.711
<i>I know you put yourself ahead
of everybody else.</i>

545
00:54:30.646 --> 00:54:33.028
<i>I bet there's even been
a couple of abortions</i>

546
00:54:33.028 --> 00:54:35.755
<i>along the way. huh?</i>

547
00:54:35.755 --> 00:54:37.550
Fuck you.

548
00:54:40.656 --> 00:54:42.451
Fuck you.

549
00:54:43.521 --> 00:54:47.353
You know nothing.

550
00:54:47.353 --> 00:54:49.078
<i>Why is that. Alice?</i>

551
00:55:01.436 --> 00:55:05.474
Because I can't have children.

552
00:55:05.474 --> 00:55:07.545
<i>Am I meant to feel bad?</i>

553
00:55:10.514 --> 00:55:13.033
<i>We both know you'd do
or say anything</i>

554
00:55:13.033 --> 00:55:14.794
<i>to save your life right now.</i>

555
00:55:26.737 --> 00:55:28.497
My life?

556
00:55:32.018 --> 00:55:35.504
My whole life has been
about pleasing men.

557
00:55:35.504 --> 00:55:38.404
My--

558
00:55:38.404 --> 00:55:42.166
My father.

559
00:55:42.166 --> 00:55:44.444
my husband.

560
00:55:44.444 --> 00:55:45.894
my boss.

561
00:55:55.835 --> 00:56:01.358
I'm sure you know what it's like
to never feel good enough.

562
00:56:07.743 --> 00:56:10.470
Do you know what it does
to a marriage?

563
00:56:21.723 --> 00:56:23.034
I'm...

564
00:56:23.034 --> 00:56:26.624
not having an affair
'cause I'm in love.

565
00:56:29.765 --> 00:56:32.768
I'm having an affair
'cause I'm in pain.

566
00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:47.611
And I love my husband.

567
00:56:47.611 --> 00:56:50.476
I'm--

568
00:56:50.476 --> 00:56:52.650
I love-- I love him.

569
00:56:58.656 --> 00:57:00.037
<i>That's so sad.</i>

570
00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:05.870
<i>So sad that it takes being at
the end of a gun for two people</i>

571
00:57:05.870 --> 00:57:08.735
<i>to finally have
a real conversation.</i>

572
00:57:37.315 --> 00:57:39.214
Yes. yes. yes.

573
00:57:44.978 --> 00:57:47.153
No! No. I'm here!

574
00:57:47.153 --> 00:57:49.293
No!

575
00:57:49.293 --> 00:57:51.122
Help! I'm right here!

576
00:58:07.069 --> 00:58:08.864
<i>Alice?</i>

577
00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:14.145
<i>Are you hiding again?</i>

578
00:58:28.919 --> 00:58:31.059
<i>Where are you?</i>

579
00:58:43.796 --> 00:58:45.556
Oh. my God.

580
00:58:55.635 --> 00:58:58.086
<i>Where are you. Alice?</i>

581
01:01:13.324 --> 01:01:16.120
Fuck!

582
01:01:26.061 --> 01:01:28.029
Oh. my God.

583
01:01:48.049 --> 01:01:50.292
<i>You can't run
from this. Alice.</i>

584
01:01:52.536 --> 01:01:54.331
<i>Not anymore.</i>

585
01:01:56.195 --> 01:01:58.300
<i>Because there's
nowhere to hide.</i>

586
01:02:00.337 --> 01:02:02.097
<i>Nowhere to go.</i>

587
01:02:05.169 --> 01:02:08.310
<i>That's the reason you ran
back in here. isn't it?</i>

588
01:03:05.195 --> 01:03:06.990
<i>Alice?</i>

589
01:03:12.616 --> 01:03:14.963
<i>Hello?</i>

590
01:03:14.963 --> 01:03:18.484
<i>Are you still with me. Alice?</i>

591
01:03:18.484 --> 01:03:20.279
<i>Are you still there?</i>

592
01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:33.257
<i>It's becoming unbearable.
isn't it?</i>

593
01:03:33.257 --> 01:03:36.398
<i>The pain.</i>

594
01:03:36.398 --> 01:03:38.435
<i>It leads to anger.</i>

595
01:03:38.435 --> 01:03:40.333
<i>It leads to violence.</i>

596
01:03:47.064 --> 01:03:51.068
<i>Don't you feel a paradigm
shift in this country.</i>

597
01:03:51.068 --> 01:03:56.142
<i>toward selfishness
and brute force?</i>

598
01:03:56.142 --> 01:04:01.078
<i>Why is it easier for a kid to
buy an AR-15 than a six pack?</i>

599
01:04:03.149 --> 01:04:06.946
<i>That's because the DNA
to not give a shit</i>

600
01:04:06.946 --> 01:04:10.916
<i>is more desirable from
an evolutionary standpoint.</i>

601
01:04:10.916 --> 01:04:12.883
<i>Plain and simple.</i>

602
01:04:14.643 --> 01:04:20.166
<i>Do you think that the shooters
in Vegas or Florida or Buffalo</i>

603
01:04:20.166 --> 01:04:25.896
<i>or Uvalde or Sandy Hook
had any feelings of guilt?</i>

604
01:04:36.010 --> 01:04:37.977
<i>Do you think
I should feel any guilt?</i>

605
01:04:37.977 --> 01:04:40.980
<i>Do you feel guilt?</i>

606
01:04:43.086 --> 01:04:44.673
<i>If you don't believe it's wrong</i>

607
01:04:44.673 --> 01:04:46.468
<i>to do the things
that serve your needs.</i>

608
01:04:46.468 --> 01:04:48.263
<i>why should I?</i>

609
01:04:50.472 --> 01:04:53.993
<i>What do you think drives
the company you work for?</i>

610
01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.552
<i>Look at the thousands
of people you've harmed.</i>

611
01:05:06.661 --> 01:05:10.044
<i>Who's worse?</i>

612
01:05:10.044 --> 01:05:12.011
<i>Who's done more damage?</i>

613
01:05:16.464 --> 01:05:19.501
<i>Just because you don't have
your finger on the trigger</i>

614
01:05:19.501 --> 01:05:23.574
<i>doesn't make you
any less of a killer.</i>

615
01:05:23.574 --> 01:05:27.751
<i>You don't care about people.</i>

616
01:05:27.751 --> 01:05:32.066
<i>All you really care about
is the money.</i>

617
01:05:32.066 --> 01:05:34.723
<i>And you'll do or say
anything to get it.</i>

618
01:05:34.723 --> 01:05:37.347
<i>Because money is freedom.
isn't that right?</i>

619
01:05:43.042 --> 01:05:45.113
<i>Freedom to do
what you want.</i>

620
01:05:48.703 --> 01:05:51.223
<i>To buy whatever you desire.</i>

621
01:05:54.226 --> 01:05:57.056
<i>Freedom to go
anywhere you please.</i>

622
01:05:59.024 --> 01:06:01.681
<i>But I think someone
said it best.</i>

623
01:06:01.681 --> 01:06:07.170
<i>"Freedom is just another word
for nothing left to lose."</i>

624
01:06:29.778 --> 01:06:32.057
Aah!

625
01:06:32.057 --> 01:06:33.990
Fuck!

626
01:06:38.753 --> 01:06:40.479
You fucking piece of shit loser.

627
01:06:40.479 --> 01:06:42.308
It's gonna take a lot more
than killing me

628
01:06:42.308 --> 01:06:44.310
to solve
your fucking problems.

629
01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:46.312
<i>Maybe.</i>

630
01:06:46.312 --> 01:06:49.074
<i>Or maybe it will make the next
person willing to spread filth</i>

631
01:06:49.074 --> 01:06:51.662
<i>and lies think about
the consequences.</i>

632
01:07:12.235 --> 01:07:16.446
It's been a really
shitty couple of years.

633
01:07:18.551 --> 01:07:21.520
I'm angry too.

634
01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.831
I get it.

635
01:07:22.831 --> 01:07:24.764
And the media...

636
01:07:24.764 --> 01:07:27.250
does not help.

637
01:07:27.250 --> 01:07:29.769
Spreading conspiracies
all over the place.

638
01:07:29.769 --> 01:07:31.702
<i>That's the one.</i>

639
01:07:31.702 --> 01:07:33.877
<i>A conspiracy.</i>

640
01:07:33.877 --> 01:07:35.775
<i>I was waiting for you
to drop that one.</i>

641
01:07:35.775 --> 01:07:38.157
<i>Best buzzword
to devalue anything</i>

642
01:07:38.157 --> 01:07:42.299
<i>I have to say
and label me as crazy.</i>

643
01:07:42.299 --> 01:07:43.852
Did you really lose your job?

644
01:07:43.852 --> 01:07:45.682
Is that what this is...

645
01:07:48.892 --> 01:07:50.652
...Henry?

646
01:07:58.419 --> 01:08:00.455
Did you really lose a child?

647
01:08:08.187 --> 01:08:10.638
Because if that's the case.
I'm--

648
01:08:10.638 --> 01:08:13.227
I'm really. really sorry.

649
01:08:15.781 --> 01:08:17.231
<i>Who's Henry?</i>

650
01:09:15.358 --> 01:09:17.256
You got to leave.
You got to leave.

651
01:09:23.780 --> 01:09:24.884
Hey!

652
01:09:24.884 --> 01:09:27.197
Hey. get back in your car!

653
01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:41.315
Get out!

654
01:09:41.315 --> 01:09:42.661
Get out of here!

655
01:09:42.661 --> 01:09:45.422
Car!
Call-- Call the police!

656
01:09:50.565 --> 01:09:52.774
Shit.
- Ohh!

657
01:09:52.774 --> 01:09:54.397
Shit.

658
01:09:54.397 --> 01:09:56.364
Hey. get back in your car!

659
01:09:56.364 --> 01:10:00.334
Get out of the way!

660
01:10:00.334 --> 01:10:04.269
- Bob.
- Hide.

661
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:07.375
No. move out!

662
01:10:09.515 --> 01:10:11.724
What are you doing?

663
01:10:11.724 --> 01:10:13.657
No. what are you doing?
No!

664
01:10:50.832 --> 01:10:53.766
<i>Well. that was touching.</i>

665
01:10:53.766 --> 01:10:55.803
<i>That's the kind of
sentimental crap</i>

666
01:10:55.803 --> 01:10:59.669
<i>that will die off
with that generation.</i>

667
01:10:59.669 --> 01:11:02.430
<i>What scares you most is
knowing that. deep down.</i>

668
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:06.814
<i>we like it that way. because
you and I. we are survivors.</i>

669
01:11:06.814 --> 01:11:09.092
No!

670
01:11:09.092 --> 01:11:12.751
We're nothing alike!

671
01:11:15.961 --> 01:11:19.792
<i>You're in denial. Alice.</i>

672
01:11:19.792 --> 01:11:22.001
<i>The only reason
we're both still alive</i>

673
01:11:22.001 --> 01:11:24.763
<i>is because we share that gene.</i>

674
01:11:24.763 --> 01:11:30.078
<i>And it's that gene you'll pass
down to your unborn child.</i>

675
01:11:30.078 --> 01:11:32.702
<i>If you ever actually
get pregnant.</i>

676
01:11:39.502 --> 01:11:42.712
That's exactly why
I can't have children.

677
01:11:42.712 --> 01:11:44.955
Because I don't wanna fear
for their lives

678
01:11:44.955 --> 01:11:47.613
every time
they leave the house.

679
01:11:47.613 --> 01:11:52.515
Because I don't want them
bullied on their phones.

680
01:11:52.515 --> 01:11:56.622
feeling unloved and alone.

681
01:11:56.622 --> 01:12:01.109
Depressed and bitter

682
01:12:01.109 --> 01:12:04.354
to potentially end up a coward!

683
01:12:06.977 --> 01:12:10.567
Hiding in the dark.
killing innocent people.

684
01:12:13.812 --> 01:12:15.365
I can't have children

685
01:12:15.365 --> 01:12:19.852
because people like you
exist in the world.

686
01:12:19.852 --> 01:12:23.062
But most of all.

687
01:12:23.062 --> 01:12:28.482
I can't have children because
it's my fucking choice!

688
01:12:30.104 --> 01:12:33.107
And it's the same choice
your mother would have made

689
01:12:33.107 --> 01:12:36.144
if she knew
what you'd become!

690
01:12:49.572 --> 01:12:52.644
Hey.

691
01:12:52.644 --> 01:12:54.887
Hey. get down.

692
01:12:55.647 --> 01:12:58.408
Hey. get down.

693
01:12:58.408 --> 01:12:59.823
Lay down.

694
01:13:03.448 --> 01:13:05.415
Grandma.

695
01:13:08.694 --> 01:13:10.834
Fuck.

696
01:13:12.664 --> 01:13:15.460
Listen. I know that you think
that by doing this.

697
01:13:15.460 --> 01:13:17.738
it's gonna give meaning
to your life. but it won't.

698
01:13:17.738 --> 01:13:19.222
They'll kill you

699
01:13:19.222 --> 01:13:21.604
or they'll cornered you
and you'll kill yourself.

700
01:13:21.604 --> 01:13:23.778
Just like all the others.

701
01:13:23.778 --> 01:13:25.435
And they're just gonna
write it off

702
01:13:25.435 --> 01:13:26.885
like another shooting.

703
01:13:26.885 --> 01:13:28.714
and people will send
their thoughts and prayers

704
01:13:28.714 --> 01:13:32.615
but no one will give a fuck
and nothing is gonna change.

705
01:13:32.615 --> 01:13:34.513
<i>Oh. you're right.</i>

706
01:13:34.513 --> 01:13:38.966
<i>Nothing will change. because
I only exist in you mind.</i>

707
01:13:38.966 --> 01:13:41.762
<i>I'm your creation.</i>

708
01:13:41.762 --> 01:13:43.764
<i>I am your perception</i>

709
01:13:43.764 --> 01:13:45.559
<i>that you have
projected onto me</i>

710
01:13:45.559 --> 01:13:48.665
<i>so you never have to hear
the real reasons why.</i>

711
01:13:48.665 --> 01:13:52.497
<i>No matter how justified.
I'm just a crazy shooter.</i>

712
01:13:52.497 --> 01:13:55.051
<i>The right-wing nut.
the conspiracy theorist.</i>
