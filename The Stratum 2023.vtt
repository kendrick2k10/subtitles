00:00:17.234 --> 00:00:19.845
[Brewer] Where am I?
[cloth ripping off]

5
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.065
[Julia] Couple miles outside of
Corp-Gov jurisdiction.

6
00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:24.067
[Giselle] Somewhere safe.

7
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:26.765
What is this?!
Release me immediately!

8
00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.332
[Brewer] Do you know who I am?!

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:30.160
Michael Brewer.

10
00:00:30.334 --> 00:00:33.381
Born 2011. no children.
widower...

11
00:00:33.555 --> 00:00:34.991
My condolences.

12
00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:36.732
[Julia] You've been employed
by Wrightcorp

13
00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:38.647
since practically the beginning.

14
00:00:38.821 --> 00:00:40.344
Making nuclear energy
innovations

15
00:00:40.518 --> 00:00:44.261
until transitioning
into the development

16
00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:46.568
and commercialization of--

[violent coughing]
[wheezing]

which--

00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:55.664
[continued coughing]

20
00:00:56.317 --> 00:00:58.667
Which brings us to your
business with us.

21
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:00.582
I'll have no business with you!

22
00:01:00.756 --> 00:01:02.192
Oh no?

23
00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.847
I don't do business
with infected criminals!

24
00:01:05.021 --> 00:01:07.719
Rest assured. Mr. Brewer

25
00:01:07.893 --> 00:01:09.504
the infection in our
lungs has not

26
00:01:09.678 --> 00:01:11.897
infected our business integrity.

27
00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:14.857
[rattling. wet cough]

00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:17.294

[continued coughing]

30
00:01:28.044 --> 00:01:31.221
Between us. Mr. Brewer

31
00:01:31.395 --> 00:01:34.355
I think this might be her
last business trip.

32
00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:36.922
[Brewer] Look. if it's ransom
money you want

33
00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.185
the company's insurance policy
will more than--

34
00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:40.926
You can't buy what we
want. Mr. Brewer.

35
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:43.233
You can only take it.

36
00:01:43.407 --> 00:01:45.757
Who-- who are you?

37
00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:48.151
[Edgar] Who am I?

38
00:01:48.325 --> 00:01:50.762
I'm not that different from you.
Mr. Brewer.

39
00:01:50.936 --> 00:01:53.635
We both serve a purpose.

40
00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:56.203
You serve a company;
you're a company man.

41
00:01:57.291 --> 00:01:59.815
I serve the people.

42
00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:02.165
So. I guess that makes me a--

43
00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:06.561
I guess that makes me
a people person.

44
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.390
Oh. god.

45
00:02:09.564 --> 00:02:10.826
Are you--

46
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.958
Are you People's Army?

47
00:02:13.133 --> 00:02:16.658
[Edgar] By stifling the voice of
the "infected" as you call us.

48
00:02:16.832 --> 00:02:19.400
[Edgar] Wrightcorp has
driven us toward desperation.

49
00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:22.925
And violence.

50
00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.275
In that way. I suppose

51
00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.060
your company has
criminalized change.

52
00:02:28.235 --> 00:02:30.019
[Brewer] Look. I-- I--
I'm sorry

53
00:02:30.193 --> 00:02:31.412
for what's happened to you.

54
00:02:31.586 --> 00:02:32.587
To all of you.

55
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:34.545
I-- I really am.

56
00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.504
But none of that is my fault.

57
00:02:36.678 --> 00:02:37.766
No.

58
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.898
That's true.

59
00:02:40.072 --> 00:02:43.337
You're just a symptom of a
much larger disease.

60
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:45.034
But we have a cure for that.

61
00:02:45.208 --> 00:02:46.862
[Brewer] No. no. no no no no.
no! Please!

62
00:02:47.036 --> 00:02:48.733
[Brewer] No no no. listen. I.
I can't get--

63
00:02:48.907 --> 00:02:49.821
Please!

64
00:02:49.995 --> 00:02:53.042
[Ramone] Shhhhhh...

65
00:02:53.216 --> 00:02:56.480
Your air is precious now.

68
00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:03.008
Now...

69
00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:05.185
I need to know where
Wrightcorp is developing the

70
00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.056
new gravity free-gen tech.

71
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.972
[EDGAR] The good compact stuff.
you know what I'm talking about.

72
00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:11.191
[Edgar] So. Ramone here

73
00:03:11.365 --> 00:03:13.193
will hold on to your mask

74
00:03:13.367 --> 00:03:15.456
until you tell us.

75
00:03:17.806 --> 00:03:20.112
[Edgar] Now you have no voice.

76
00:03:22.332 --> 00:03:24.595
Now your every breath
is precious.

77
00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:26.423
[Brewer] [sputters air]

78
00:03:26.597 --> 00:03:29.296
[Edgar] How much longer until
you're the infected criminal?

79
00:03:34.388 --> 00:03:36.259
[hard exhale] Alright!

80
00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:38.043
[Brewer] There's a testing
bunker under

81
00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:39.654
the building at 1038 Shine
Street!

82
00:03:39.828 --> 00:03:41.873
Shine Street!
1038!

83
00:03:42.047 --> 00:03:44.659
They-- they store prototypes
and compact systems

84
00:03:44.833 --> 00:03:46.443
in different stages
of development.

85
00:03:46.617 --> 00:03:48.315
But you need special clearance!

86
00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.708
Who controls clearance?
[Brewer] Grav-tech

87
00:03:50.882 --> 00:03:53.015

security techs!

88
00:03:53.189 --> 00:03:54.321
Names. Michael!

89
00:03:56.061 --> 00:03:57.019
I need names.

90

91
00:03:59.891 --> 00:04:01.502
Larson! Howard Larson!

92
00:04:01.676 --> 00:04:03.939
Larson's the work-from-Earth
CSO.

93
00:04:04.113 --> 00:04:06.507
[Brewer] He can generate keys
and passes. whatever.

94
00:04:06.681 --> 00:04:09.292
He runs ground and
orbital security operations

95
00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:11.425
from his compound on Earth.

96
00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.383
Look I-- I can help you!

97
00:04:13.557 --> 00:04:15.429
Just please give me
my mask back. please!

98
00:04:15.603 --> 00:04:18.649
I-- I can't get A.C.H.E.

99
00:04:18.823 --> 00:04:20.695

me!

101
00:04:28.877 --> 00:04:30.748
[Brewer] Oh no-- no no no no
don't do--

102
00:04:30.922 --> 00:04:32.228
No. don't do this!

103
00:04:32.402 --> 00:04:34.752
No look. I--
I'm worth more to you alive!

104
00:04:34.926 --> 00:04:36.537

show for you folks tonight

118
00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:34.421
The two-year running MVP Nick
"The Iceman" Donovan

119
00:05:34.595 --> 00:05:36.205
will be joining us. remotely of
course

120
00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:38.599
to discuss his short-lived but
exceptional career

121
00:05:38.773 --> 00:05:41.123
as the premiere pitcher in the
Infected Baseball League

122
00:05:41.297 --> 00:05:43.168
and what his failing health can
teach

123
00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.040
other top-tier infected athletes

124
00:05:45.214 --> 00:05:47.216
about ACHE. and the impact that
repeated outbreaks

125
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.391
might have on their careers.

126
00:05:48.565 --> 00:05:50.219
Donovan made headlines in 2053

127
00:05:50.393 --> 00:05:52.787
after his infected status meant
he had to drop out of the MLB

128

[creepy voice] They're trying to
cut me!

134
00:06:05.887 --> 00:06:08.193
[Nova] Anyway this morning I
wake up. have a cup of coffee

135
00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:10.326
and start coughing blood out my
nose.

136
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.415
Nothin' new. I know.
just another Tuesday

137

Except this time the blood's
some thick. purple color

139

so. you know. hell with it

140
00:06:18.943 --> 00:06:20.641
I figure I'll stop by one of
those new

00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:23.557
Wrightcorp-sponsored health
clinics before I get here

142
00:06:23.731 --> 00:06:26.168
to the studio to do the
morning's 'Early Grave'.

143
00:06:26.342 --> 00:06:28.562

infected doctor

144

145
00:06:30.128 --> 00:06:32.566

Syndrome

147
00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:37.658

variant! [crowd cheering]

148
00:06:37.832 --> 00:06:39.964
[Nova] Meaning I am one of

of humanity's favorite plague.

150
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.447

00:06:52.063 --> 00:06:54.326
do some tests and I'll get to
meet a fine. uninfected lady

00:09:01.105 --> 00:09:02.498
Yeah.

182
00:09:02.672 --> 00:09:04.587
[Edgar] Mmmm. Bet that smelled
ripe.

183
00:09:04.761 --> 00:09:06.589
I-- I mean I wouldn't know.
-Ah. right.

184
00:09:06.763 --> 00:09:08.548
I'm glad I don't have to wear
one of

185
00:09:08.722 --> 00:09:10.375
those things on my face
anymore.

186
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.161
One of the benefits of having
a debilitating lung infection.

187
00:09:13.335 --> 00:09:15.729
You people with your masks are
missing all the smells of this

188
00:09:15.903 --> 00:09:17.557
brave new world.

189
00:09:19.297 --> 00:09:21.169
Okay. do we have login
credentials?

190
00:09:21.343 --> 00:09:22.692
All we had was the housekeeper.

191
00:09:22.866 --> 00:09:24.259
And you.

192
00:09:24.433 --> 00:09:25.913
She doesn't know where he keeps
his private stuff?

193
00:09:26.087 --> 00:09:27.828
Not that kind of housekeeper.

194
00:09:28.002 --> 00:09:30.134
[Edgar] Guess you're gonna have
to work your magic.

195
00:09:30.308 --> 00:09:31.571
[rapid typing]

196
00:09:31.745 --> 00:09:33.311
How'd you get her to
cooperate anyway?

197
00:09:33.485 --> 00:09:34.748
[Edgar] That's need-to-know.

198
00:09:34.922 --> 00:09:36.793
[James] Well. I 'need-to-know'
if she's gonna

199
00:09:36.967 --> 00:09:38.578
tip off anybody at Wrightcorp.

200
00:09:40.362 --> 00:09:41.798
Her brother works for me.

201
00:09:41.972 --> 00:09:43.583
She's not gonna tell anyone
anything--

202
00:09:43.757 --> 00:09:44.801
Wait. she's infected?!

203
00:09:44.975 --> 00:09:46.760
[Edgar] No! Her brother has the
aches...

204
00:09:46.934 --> 00:09:49.589
She doesn't. The house is clean.

205
00:09:50.938 --> 00:09:51.939
[Edgar] Look

206
00:09:52.113 --> 00:09:53.810
You don't know me yet.

207
00:09:53.984 --> 00:09:56.552
But you're gonna have to trust
me if you wanna get paid.

208
00:09:56.726 --> 00:09:57.988
This is how I work.

209
00:09:58.162 --> 00:10:00.382
You'll get used to it.

210
00:10:00.556 --> 00:10:03.211
[deep exhale]

211
00:10:03.385 --> 00:10:04.734
Well what's wrong with this guy
then?

212
00:10:04.908 --> 00:10:06.170
If he doesn't have A.C.H.E. then

213
00:10:06.344 --> 00:10:07.563
why's he gotta stay grounded?

214
00:10:07.737 --> 00:10:09.130
[Edgar] What do you mean?

215
00:10:09.304 --> 00:10:11.045
[James] I mean you'd think
they'd house their

216
00:10:11.219 --> 00:10:12.568
security team on the space
station.

217
00:10:12.742 --> 00:10:14.352
[scoff] Please.

218
00:10:14.526 --> 00:10:16.616
A one-bedroom apartment up there
goes for a billion dollars.

219
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:18.356
You think they're gonna give the
real estate

220
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:19.967
to house a keyboard monkey?
-Hey.

221
00:10:20.141 --> 00:10:21.229
[Edgar] I'm just saying

222
00:10:21.403 --> 00:10:23.231
they outsource everything down
here

223
00:10:23.405 --> 00:10:25.581
while they grow daffodils in
artificial gravity

224
00:10:25.755 --> 00:10:26.974
and shit in golden toilets.

225
00:10:27.148 --> 00:10:28.584
[grunts]

226
00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:30.238
Yeah. kinda makes the wealth
disparity between

227
00:10:30.412 --> 00:10:33.545
your people and my people pale
in comparison. doesn't it?

228
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.417
Sure.

229
00:10:38.986 --> 00:10:40.422
[hard keystroke]
[access chime]

230
00:10:40.596 --> 00:10:42.250
And we're in.

231
00:10:42.424 --> 00:10:43.991
[Edgar] Cool. Look for anything
confidential or classified.

232
00:10:44.165 --> 00:10:45.688
Wait. Hold on. Dude.

233
00:10:45.862 --> 00:10:47.951
This is a very sophisticated
system. okay there's

234
00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:50.650
multiple firewalls. honeypots.
subsystem dead-ends that--

235
00:10:53.087 --> 00:10:55.002
The point is. I'm not going to
make all that go away.

236
00:10:55.176 --> 00:10:56.743
It's gonna take days.

237
00:10:56.917 --> 00:10:58.658
Which...

238
00:10:58.832 --> 00:11:00.660
is enough time for somebody at
Wrightcorp to notice a certain

239
00:11:00.834 --> 00:11:03.706
recently fired employee
not doing his job.

240
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:06.448
[Edgar] I'm guessing you have a
plan for that.

241
00:11:08.798 --> 00:11:10.104
[blowing old USB]

242
00:11:11.148 --> 00:11:11.845
[USB snapping in]

243
00:11:12.019 --> 00:11:13.020
[access chime]

244
00:11:13.194 --> 00:11:15.326
Let's see if our friend

245
00:11:16.632 --> 00:11:17.764
Howard Larson

246
00:11:17.938 --> 00:11:19.069
[scoff]

247
00:11:19.243 --> 00:11:21.071
took a lot of selfies.

248
00:11:21.245 --> 00:11:22.899
[typing]
[hard keystroke]

249
00:11:23.073 --> 00:11:24.074
[amused whine]

250
00:11:24.248 --> 00:11:25.859
[program working]

251
00:11:26.033 --> 00:11:29.645
[James] A stirring. in-memoriam
montage for Howard Larson

252
00:11:29.819 --> 00:11:31.255
Adieu.

253
00:11:31.429 --> 00:11:32.256
[keystroke. beep]

254
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:33.910
Hi there! This is Howard Larson!

255
00:11:34.084 --> 00:11:36.130
I just want everyone to know
that I spent

256
00:11:36.304 --> 00:11:38.741
my life working for a spineless.
wack-job multi-trillionaire

257
00:11:38.915 --> 00:11:41.048
who eats the poor for breakfast.
I have no conscience.

258
00:11:41.222 --> 00:11:42.571
And. in death

259
00:11:42.745 --> 00:11:44.312
I am a traitor to my
corporate overlords!

260
00:11:44.486 --> 00:11:46.531
[Edgar] You'd better not
send that to anyone.

261
00:11:46.706 --> 00:11:48.708
What? And tarnish my spotless
reputation?

262
00:11:48.882 --> 00:11:50.013
[key slam]
[Edgar] [chuckling]

263
00:11:50.187 --> 00:11:51.928
There.

264
00:11:52.102 --> 00:11:53.930
I should be able to do all of
Howard's busy work remotely now.

265
00:11:54.104 --> 00:11:56.237
No one will ask any questions.

266
00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:57.891
[Edgar] Good.

267
00:11:58.065 --> 00:11:59.675
Do his job. send us
everything you can about--

268
00:11:59.849 --> 00:12:00.937
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

269
00:12:01.111 --> 00:12:02.504
Station schematics. top secret
projects

270
00:12:02.678 --> 00:12:03.810
personnel records.

271
00:12:03.984 --> 00:12:05.333
You'll have a full list of the
various

272
00:12:05.507 --> 00:12:06.769
endangered caviar available

273
00:12:06.943 --> 00:12:09.119
on William Wright's executive
lunch menu.

274
00:12:09.293 --> 00:12:10.294
You're a natural.

275
00:12:10.468 --> 00:12:12.296
I knew I did good hiring you.

276
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:14.864
You're every bit as good
as they said you were.

277
00:12:15.038 --> 00:12:16.518
I think...

278
00:12:16.692 --> 00:12:18.694
this is the beginning of
a beautiful friendship.

279
00:12:18.868 --> 00:12:21.088
[gasp from inhaler]

280
00:12:21.262 --> 00:12:22.089
Y-- yeah. I--

281
00:12:22.263 --> 00:12:24.178
I hope so. [chuckle]

282
00:12:27.572 --> 00:12:29.270
Well I'm gonna make myself
at home here Edgar

283
00:12:29.444 --> 00:12:30.445
and I um--

284
00:12:30.619 --> 00:12:31.315
Call you tomorrow.

285
00:12:31.489 --> 00:12:32.316
See you tomorrow kid.

286
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:33.491
Good job.

287
00:12:33.665 --> 00:12:34.928
[transmission end chime]

288
00:12:35.102 --> 00:12:35.711
[hologram whoosh]

289
00:12:35.885 --> 00:12:37.147
[Grocer] What's my job?

290
00:12:37.321 --> 00:12:38.714
I feed hundreds of kids a day.

291
00:12:38.888 --> 00:12:40.368
I keep the engines runnin'.

292
00:12:40.542 --> 00:12:42.239
I keep the space station in
orbit!

293
00:12:42.413 --> 00:12:44.764
[announcer] And Wrightcorp
keeps making it possible.

294
00:12:44.938 --> 00:12:47.244
Since Wrightcorp was founded
in 2043

295
00:12:47.418 --> 00:12:49.638
the world's foremost energy
conglomerate has expanded

296
00:12:49.812 --> 00:12:51.553
into nearly every global
industry.

297
00:12:51.727 --> 00:12:53.990
Including national defense

298
00:12:54.164 --> 00:12:55.383
shipping. and even

299
00:12:55.557 --> 00:12:57.080
entertainment!

300
00:12:57.254 --> 00:12:59.387
Hi! I'm William Wright.

301
00:12:59.561 --> 00:13:02.129
Now the world has undoubtedly
changed over the last decade.

302
00:13:02.303 --> 00:13:03.478
Fossil fuel shortage.

303
00:13:03.652 --> 00:13:04.740
Shifting climate.

304
00:13:04.914 --> 00:13:06.655
And a global health crisis.

305
00:13:06.829 --> 00:13:08.222
But the earth as it was

306
00:13:08.396 --> 00:13:10.790
still lives inside each and
every one of us.

307
00:13:10.964 --> 00:13:11.965
In our hearts.

308
00:13:12.139 --> 00:13:13.575
In our hopes.

309
00:13:13.749 --> 00:13:16.143
In our sense of community.

310
00:13:17.361 --> 00:13:19.363
Our top scientists here on
Wright Station

311
00:13:19.537 --> 00:13:21.757
are dedicated to providing
reliable energy

312
00:13:21.931 --> 00:13:23.324
and cutting edge technology

313
00:13:23.498 --> 00:13:25.195
to our millions of customers

314
00:13:25.369 --> 00:13:27.197
living down on the planet's
surface.

315
00:13:27.371 --> 00:13:28.764
And while we innovate

316
00:13:28.938 --> 00:13:30.200
we ask you

317
00:13:30.374 --> 00:13:32.681
to keep the world turning.

318
00:13:32.855 --> 00:13:34.901
Whether you're a privileged
uninfected citizen

319
00:13:35.075 --> 00:13:37.947
or one of the millions of
infected essential workers

320
00:13:38.121 --> 00:13:39.427
there is a place for you

321
00:13:39.601 --> 00:13:42.212
in a Wrightcorp Indentured
Endeavor.

322
00:13:42.386 --> 00:13:44.127
By providing work opportunities

323
00:13:44.301 --> 00:13:45.389
universal housing

324
00:13:45.563 --> 00:13:46.956
and a standard basic income

325
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.002
we have brought the
unemployment rate down

326
00:13:49.176 --> 00:13:51.047
to nearly zero.

327
00:13:51.221 --> 00:13:53.006
So. from the lab tech in orbit

328
00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.269
to the essential worker on the
ground...

329
00:13:55.443 --> 00:13:57.619
[scientist] I'm doing my part.
[mechanic] I'm doing my part.

330
00:13:57.793 --> 00:13:59.186
[Grocer] I'm doing my part.

331
00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:00.404
[Wright] And that's...

332
00:14:00.578 --> 00:14:02.842
Doin' it Wright.

333
00:14:03.016 --> 00:14:04.626

God dammit. Howard. Wright is--

339
00:14:12.982 --> 00:14:14.592
[Parsons] I'll say he's
displeased.

340
00:14:14.766 --> 00:14:16.072
at the ambient noise

341
00:14:16.246 --> 00:14:18.031
in the security feed from
Project A.

342
00:14:18.205 --> 00:14:19.380
It's gotta be the

343
00:14:19.554 --> 00:14:21.121
updated climate control.

344
00:14:21.295 --> 00:14:23.079
Add some post noise reduction
to the video feed

345
00:14:23.253 --> 00:14:25.865
so he can watch his daughter. Or
next time he flips out

346
00:14:26.039 --> 00:14:27.823
-I'll let him know it was your--
-Project A

347
00:14:27.997 --> 00:14:29.869
stupid cousin who
installed the noisy-ass

348
00:14:30.043 --> 00:14:31.783
filtration system. Seriously!
-Whoa.

349
00:14:31.958 --> 00:14:34.308
[Parsons] It's space! How bad
do you have to screw up an

350
00:14:34.482 --> 00:14:36.876
installation for there to be
too much ambient noise?!

351
00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:38.703
Fix it!

[CARON] Good morning
Miss Wright!

355
00:15:05.687 --> 00:15:06.949
Nooooooo!

356
00:15:07.123 --> 00:15:09.386
[CARON] The time is 9:45am.

357
00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.432
[Ayla] Hey CARON.
[CARON] Miss Wright?

358
00:15:11.606 --> 00:15:14.739
Reset the clocks to...

359
00:15:14.914 --> 00:15:15.915

00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:46.729
[Ayla] Honestly I haven't
worked on any of this in awhile.

542
00:23:46.903 --> 00:23:48.339
Why. you've been working on your

543
00:23:48.514 --> 00:23:50.341
big dangerous engine thing?

544
00:23:50.516 --> 00:23:52.953
What are you really doing here?!
-Your father assigned me

545
00:23:53.127 --> 00:23:54.302
the prestigious job of

546
00:23:54.476 --> 00:23:55.738
keeping you company--
-[mock buzzer]

547
00:23:55.912 --> 00:23:56.957
[Ayla] Wrong answer!

548
00:23:57.131 --> 00:23:59.699
Would you like to play again?

549
00:23:59.873 --> 00:24:00.961
Okay.

550
00:24:01.135 --> 00:24:03.093
My alternate functionality is

551
00:24:03.267 --> 00:24:04.268
[James] as a...

552
00:24:04.443 --> 00:24:05.226
security monitor.

553
00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.054
I knew it!

554
00:24:07.228 --> 00:24:09.448
[James] Yes. my charming
personality and witty banter

555
00:24:09.622 --> 00:24:11.145
serve as a fluffy cushion
surrounding my

556
00:24:11.319 --> 00:24:13.582
anti-malware and digital
policing protocols.

557
00:24:13.756 --> 00:24:15.105
[Ayla] Policing! [sarcastic
laugh]

558
00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:16.672
Well that's fun.

559
00:24:16.846 --> 00:24:18.587
Well hey. I think I deserve some
credit though.

560
00:24:18.761 --> 00:24:20.415
-Yeah? Why's that?
-I am programmed

561
00:24:20.589 --> 00:24:22.199
to lie to you about my
functionality.

562
00:24:22.373 --> 00:24:24.201
Well that makes me feel so much
better!

563
00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:26.682
[James] I just thought you
deserved to know the truth.

564
00:24:26.856 --> 00:24:28.641
[Ayla] And how exactly are you
able to

565
00:24:28.815 --> 00:24:30.599
circumvent your behavioral
programming?

566
00:24:32.514 --> 00:24:34.124
I guess I'm a little fucked up.

567
00:24:34.298 --> 00:24:35.561
[scoffs]

568
00:24:35.735 --> 00:24:37.998
Yeah. I'd say so.

569
00:24:48.661 --> 00:24:50.097
K Bye.

570
00:24:50.271 --> 00:24:51.838
Oh! Uh...

571
00:24:52.012 --> 00:24:53.796
Well it has been a pleasure
making your acquaintan--

572
00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:55.363
[laser rifle arming]
[James] --nnce.

573
00:24:55.537 --> 00:24:57.452
Okay.

574
00:25:00.542 --> 00:25:01.674
Wait!

575
00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:04.807
[Ayla] Where are you gonna be?

576
00:25:04.981 --> 00:25:05.939
[James] Oh I donno. Just

577
00:25:06.113 --> 00:25:07.593
around.

578
00:25:07.767 --> 00:25:08.942
I live here now

579
00:25:09.116 --> 00:25:10.509
so...

580
00:25:22.216 --> 00:25:24.261
[grinding digital transition]

581
00:25:26.002 --> 00:25:27.438
[surprised laugh]

582
00:25:27.613 --> 00:25:28.570
[James] And she's adorable!

583
00:25:28.744 --> 00:25:30.180
[Edgar] This is amazing.

584
00:25:30.354 --> 00:25:32.487
A little on the angry side but
that's probably

585
00:25:32.661 --> 00:25:33.836
just cabin fever--
-This is exactly

586
00:25:34.010 --> 00:25:36.012
the kind of thing we're looking
for. Now we

587
00:25:36.186 --> 00:25:38.188
can leverage this information--
-I know. I know

588
00:25:38.362 --> 00:25:40.277
I need to keep building trust.
pick her brain

589
00:25:40.451 --> 00:25:42.062
for information--
-You talked to her?!

590
00:25:42.236 --> 00:25:43.063
You saw her picture

591
00:25:43.237 --> 00:25:44.455
of course I talked to her.

592
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.240
[Edgar] What were you thinking?!

593
00:25:46.414 --> 00:25:48.459
If Wright gets wind of
anything that we're doing

594
00:25:48.634 --> 00:25:50.113
we're done!
-It's fine man!

595
00:25:50.287 --> 00:25:51.854
I've developed a solid alter
ego.

596
00:25:52.028 --> 00:25:53.203
I'm basically like

597
00:25:53.377 --> 00:25:54.944
if James Bond was a phishing
scam.

598
00:25:55.118 --> 00:25:56.685
[Edgar] The number of people
relying on you

599
00:25:56.859 --> 00:25:57.991
not to fuck this up--

600
00:25:58.165 --> 00:25:59.209
[James] [heavy sigh] Dude.
Relax.

601
00:25:59.383 --> 00:26:00.515
[digital whoosh]

602
00:26:00.689 --> 00:26:02.299
She thinks I'm her imaginary
friend.

603
00:26:02.473 --> 00:26:04.998
Besides I think you're gonna
want in on this doohickey she's

604
00:26:05.172 --> 00:26:07.043
developing in her VR simulation.
-Doohickey?

605
00:26:07.217 --> 00:26:09.437
Yeah. Looks like she's doing
R&amp;D on some

606
00:26:09.611 --> 00:26:11.265
engine prototype.

607
00:26:11.439 --> 00:26:12.875
Looks complicated.

608
00:26:13.049 --> 00:26:14.703
[Edgar] [ironic laugh] Must run
in the family.

609
00:26:14.877 --> 00:26:16.662
Billy Wright is perpetually
finding new ways to

610
00:26:16.836 --> 00:26:18.272
suck the energy from under us.

611
00:26:18.446 --> 00:26:20.274
Do you know how much fuel
my drivers deliver

612
00:26:20.448 --> 00:26:21.710
to that goddamn station?
-Uh...

613
00:26:21.884 --> 00:26:23.582
Fifty terrawatt hours of nuclear
batteries

614
00:26:23.756 --> 00:26:25.584
and carbon biofuels every month?

615
00:26:25.758 --> 00:26:27.542
[Edgar] Yeah that's exactly
right.

616
00:26:27.716 --> 00:26:29.718
I know! Dude I'm going through
pages and pages of

617
00:26:29.892 --> 00:26:31.546
data in there man.
-Of course.

618
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.983
Wrightcorp is covering up so
many flaws in its

619
00:26:34.157 --> 00:26:36.725
fuel storage and delivery
protocols man. it...

620
00:26:36.899 --> 00:26:38.118
[James] It's vile.

621
00:26:38.292 --> 00:26:39.336
You're tellin' me.

622
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:40.729
[James] What's it like handling

623
00:26:40.903 --> 00:26:42.601
fuel shuttle dispatch knowing
that

624
00:26:42.775 --> 00:26:46.474
30% of your employees develop
acute radiation syndrome?

625
00:26:46.648 --> 00:26:50.217
You learn to be very convincing.

626
00:26:50.391 --> 00:26:53.350
[Edgar] You know what... I trust
you with the Wright girl.

627
00:26:53.524 --> 00:26:55.570
You've been doing a good job so
far and...

628
00:26:55.744 --> 00:26:58.094
I don't see any reason why
you can't handle it your way.

629
00:26:58.268 --> 00:26:59.313
I appreciate that.

630
00:26:59.487 --> 00:27:00.923
[Edgar] I just have one
question.

631
00:27:01.097 --> 00:27:02.751
What's that?

632
00:27:02.925 --> 00:27:05.493
Why are you helping us?

633
00:27:06.537 --> 00:27:09.279
Uhhh. because you offered
to pay me six million dollars?

634
00:27:09.453 --> 00:27:12.543
[Edgar] Right. but...

635
00:27:12.718 --> 00:27:13.762
"Acheys"...

636
00:27:13.936 --> 00:27:15.764
killed your family.

637
00:27:18.724 --> 00:27:21.161
Yeah but...

638
00:27:21.335 --> 00:27:24.077
It's not like they meant to.

639
00:27:24.251 --> 00:27:26.383
And besides it's people like
Wright that made infected

640
00:27:26.557 --> 00:27:28.951
citizens desperate enough to
ignore quarantine protocols

641
00:27:29.125 --> 00:27:30.605
and riot. so...

642
00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:33.086
[James] You wanna rob him?
Be my guest.

643
00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.479
I'm happy I can use my non-
exposure privilege to help out

644
00:27:35.654 --> 00:27:37.481
essential workers and

645
00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:38.395
ya know--

646
00:27:38.569 --> 00:27:41.355
people with A.C.H.E.

647
00:27:41.529 --> 00:27:44.010
Money's nice too.

648
00:27:44.184 --> 00:27:46.534
Money's very nice.

649
00:27:46.708 --> 00:27:48.710
Well...

650
00:27:48.884 --> 00:27:52.366
It's nice to have you on board.

651
00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:54.411
[end-transmission chime]

652
00:27:58.502 --> 00:28:00.026
[engine ambience]

653
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.028
[digital error noise]

654
00:28:02.202 --> 00:28:03.899
[digital error noises]

655
00:28:04.987 --> 00:28:06.336
[repeated error noises]
[slamming keys]

656
00:28:06.510 --> 00:28:07.424
[hefty smack]

657
00:28:07.598 --> 00:28:09.209
[computer calculating]

658
00:28:09.383 --> 00:28:10.819
[sad failure noise]

659
00:28:27.836 --> 00:28:30.491
[perforated paper tearing]

660
00:28:41.284 --> 00:28:44.070
[James] "I am the only
being whose doom--!"

661
00:28:44.244 --> 00:28:45.462
[Ayla] Jesus Christ!

662
00:28:45.636 --> 00:28:47.290
[James] You have an Emily Bronte
poem

663
00:28:47.464 --> 00:28:49.423
graffitied in your art
mausoleum.

664
00:28:49.597 --> 00:28:50.990
I'm aware. Thank you!

665
00:28:51.164 --> 00:28:52.905
[James] That part of your blue
period?

666
00:28:53.079 --> 00:28:55.429
Ah. that was my Heathcliff
phase.

667
00:28:55.603 --> 00:28:56.865
[James] I don't get it.

668
00:28:57.039 --> 00:28:58.432
Wuthering Heights?

669
00:28:58.606 --> 00:29:01.130
[James] Gesundheit!

670
00:29:01.304 --> 00:29:04.743
[James] "I am the only
being whose doom

671
00:29:04.917 --> 00:29:08.050
No tongue would ask.
no eye would mourn

672
00:29:08.224 --> 00:29:10.879
I never caused a thought of
gloom

673
00:29:11.053 --> 00:29:13.839
A smile of joy since I was
born."

674
00:29:14.013 --> 00:29:15.579
What. do you have this
memorized?!

675
00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:16.624
Uh. yeah.

676
00:29:16.798 --> 00:29:18.713
I have lots of stuff memorized.

677
00:29:18.887 --> 00:29:20.628
[Ayla] Well. I am not about to
take

678
00:29:20.802 --> 00:29:23.544
literary criticism from a. um...

679
00:29:23.718 --> 00:29:25.285
glorified firewall.

680
00:29:25.459 --> 00:29:26.677
[scoff] Come on!

681
00:29:26.852 --> 00:29:27.853
I like it!

682
00:29:28.027 --> 00:29:30.029
It's misanthropic. depressing--

683
00:29:30.203 --> 00:29:32.771
Emo.

684
00:29:32.945 --> 00:29:35.512
Don't worry I've moved out
of my teenage years.

685
00:29:36.818 --> 00:29:38.515
Man...

686
00:29:38.689 --> 00:29:41.214
How long have you been up here?

687
00:29:41.388 --> 00:29:43.303
Ummm...

688
00:29:43.477 --> 00:29:46.523
I was eleven when I first
collapsed.

689
00:29:46.697 --> 00:29:49.178
and everybody thought that I had
gravity sickness. and then

690
00:29:49.352 --> 00:29:51.964
I was in and out of the hospital
until I was thirteen?

691
00:29:52.138 --> 00:29:53.661
And that's when they discovered
that I

692
00:29:53.835 --> 00:29:55.445
have a rare allergy to the

693
00:29:55.619 --> 00:29:57.186
hybrid plants

694
00:29:57.360 --> 00:29:59.145
they use to filter the air on
the main station.

695
00:29:59.319 --> 00:30:00.276
Oooooh. Damn.

696
00:30:00.450 --> 00:30:01.756
Yeah. So

697
00:30:01.930 --> 00:30:03.627
rather than have me spend my
eighth grade

698
00:30:03.802 --> 00:30:05.891
with my lungs on fire

699
00:30:06.065 --> 00:30:07.544
My dad decided to

700
00:30:07.718 --> 00:30:09.329
invest in a. um

701
00:30:09.503 --> 00:30:10.678
remote facility.

702
00:30:10.852 --> 00:30:12.680
[James] So eighth grade...

703
00:30:12.854 --> 00:30:14.334
well. you know...

704
00:30:14.508 --> 00:30:16.640
at least you got out
before your awkward phase.

705
00:30:16.815 --> 00:30:19.513
[emphatic snorting]

706
00:30:19.687 --> 00:30:21.689
[James] [laughing]

707
00:30:21.863 --> 00:30:23.386
[Ayla] [giggling]

708
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.388
[James] [continued laughter]

709
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.129
[subtle chime]

710
00:30:27.303 --> 00:30:28.391
[CARON] Miss Wright

711
00:30:28.565 --> 00:30:30.959
you have an incoming call from

712
00:30:31.133 --> 00:30:34.136
Wright Station.
[cheerful ringtone]

713
00:30:36.312 --> 00:30:39.011
[ringtone continues]

714
00:30:39.185 --> 00:30:40.969
[confirmation beep]
[electrical whirring]

715
00:30:41.143 --> 00:30:43.406
[hologram zaps to life]
[Ayla] Hey Dad!

716
00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:44.494
Nice sweater.

717
00:30:44.668 --> 00:30:45.495
[Ayla] Oh yeah?

718
00:30:45.669 --> 00:30:46.670
You like it?

719
00:30:46.845 --> 00:30:47.976
It's just some. uh...

720
00:30:48.150 --> 00:30:49.108
space garbage

721
00:30:49.282 --> 00:30:50.370
that floated in.

722
00:30:50.544 --> 00:30:52.328
Expensive space garbage.

723
00:30:52.502 --> 00:30:53.634
Like me.

724
00:30:53.808 --> 00:30:55.331
[Wright] [hearty laugh]

725
00:30:55.505 --> 00:30:57.159
And what has my
favorite space garbage

726
00:30:57.333 --> 00:30:58.334
been up to today?

727
00:30:58.508 --> 00:30:59.901
Ahhh. the usual.

728
00:31:00.075 --> 00:31:01.337
Pacing back and forth.

729
00:31:01.511 --> 00:31:02.861
Sitting.

730
00:31:03.035 --> 00:31:04.558
I argued with CARON for a bit.
[chuckle]

731
00:31:04.732 --> 00:31:06.952
[Wright] Ahhh. busy day. Well
you haven't sent me a new

732
00:31:07.126 --> 00:31:09.693
composition in a long time. Does
the music interest you anymore?

733
00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:11.130
Or the painting?

734
00:31:11.304 --> 00:31:12.783
-Eh.
-I can upload you a new module

735
00:31:12.958 --> 00:31:13.741
for whatever hobby you like.

736
00:31:13.915 --> 00:31:15.395
Yeah. I know you can.

737
00:31:15.569 --> 00:31:17.614
And he's kind of become
a pain in my ass.

738
00:31:17.788 --> 00:31:19.878
[Wright] What?
[watch beeping]

739
00:31:23.969 --> 00:31:24.839
Nevermind.

740
00:31:25.013 --> 00:31:26.406
I know it's for my own good.

741
00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:28.669
I totally understand.

742
00:31:28.843 --> 00:31:31.367
I'll let you know if I
need anything. okay?

743
00:31:31.541 --> 00:31:32.412
Promise?

744
00:31:32.586 --> 00:31:33.500
[Ayla] Promise.

745
00:31:33.674 --> 00:31:34.762
Okay.

746
00:31:34.936 --> 00:31:35.981
Hey guess what I brought.

747
00:31:36.155 --> 00:31:37.591
What?

748
00:31:37.765 --> 00:31:40.986
[childish game music]

749
00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:43.597
Oh. no way!!

750
00:31:43.771 --> 00:31:45.425
[8-bit game noises]

751
00:31:45.599 --> 00:31:46.817
Are you sure? Do you...

752
00:31:46.992 --> 00:31:48.167
have time

753
00:31:48.341 --> 00:31:50.343
to be completely destroyed
today?

754
00:31:50.517 --> 00:31:51.561
Please.

755
00:31:51.735 --> 00:31:52.606
Alright. come on.

756
00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:53.824
Give me a question.

757
00:31:53.999 --> 00:31:55.217
You ready?
-Yeah.

758
00:31:55.391 --> 00:31:57.350
What is the atomic mass of

759
00:31:57.524 --> 00:31:59.134
Triton?

760
00:31:59.308 --> 00:32:00.744
[Ayla] Come on! I thought you
were going to upload

761
00:32:00.919 --> 00:32:02.007
a harder deck this time.

762
00:32:02.181 --> 00:32:04.444
3.015501

763
00:32:04.618 --> 00:32:06.837
[sad 8-bit tone]
[Ayla] Seriously this is easy.

764
00:32:07.012 --> 00:32:08.230
[cheerful tone]
Are you ready?

765
00:32:08.404 --> 00:32:09.666
-Yeah.
-How many moons

766
00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.233
orbit the exoplanet of

767
00:32:11.407 --> 00:32:14.454
Z5Q13

768
00:32:14.628 --> 00:32:16.195
-That's the one with--
-[mocking] Uuhhhh--

769
00:32:16.369 --> 00:32:17.892
No hints!

770
00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:21.026
14.

771
00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.288
Nice try.

772
00:32:22.462 --> 00:32:23.289
It is.

773
00:32:23.463 --> 00:32:24.638
-No it's not.
-It is!

774
00:32:24.812 --> 00:32:26.379
It's not! It's 15!!

775
00:32:26.553 --> 00:32:27.989
Ha-HAA!

776
00:32:28.163 --> 00:32:29.425
[Wright] They don't count that
one as a moon.

777
00:32:29.599 --> 00:32:30.731
[Ayla] They do!

778
00:32:30.905 --> 00:32:32.472
-That's not a moon.
-It's a moon.

779
00:32:32.646 --> 00:32:34.300
[James] No. I'm talking about an
isolated docking bay

780
00:32:34.474 --> 00:32:35.257
connected to the pod

781
00:32:35.431 --> 00:32:36.606
where Daddy sends her gifts

782
00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:38.391
food. whatever.

783
00:32:38.565 --> 00:32:40.349
[Edgar] Why didn't I know about
this? I don't remember

784
00:32:40.523 --> 00:32:42.003
delivering anything to
a remote satellite.

785
00:32:42.177 --> 00:32:43.526
He's probably using a private

786
00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:45.224
courier from the main station.

787
00:32:45.398 --> 00:32:47.791
He plays everything with her
pretty close to the chest. Hell.

788
00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:50.533
for all I know I might be the
only person that has access to

789
00:32:50.707 --> 00:32:53.058
her remote monitoring systems.
-This is very interesting.

790
00:32:53.232 --> 00:32:54.494
[James] I know.

791
00:32:54.668 --> 00:32:56.148
[James] So I had a thought.

792
00:32:56.322 --> 00:32:57.671
Okay.
-And this is just me thinking

793
00:32:57.845 --> 00:32:59.281
out loud here.

794
00:32:59.455 --> 00:33:00.979
[Edgar] You usually do.

795
00:33:01.153 --> 00:33:03.503
What if we sent her a package?
-Like a scented candle?

796
00:33:03.677 --> 00:33:05.635
[James] Mmmm. I was thinking
more like...

797
00:33:05.809 --> 00:33:08.899
remote access software?

798
00:33:09.074 --> 00:33:10.684
What if we planted a rootkit?

799
00:33:10.858 --> 00:33:13.730
Okay. that's not bad.

800
00:33:13.904 --> 00:33:17.125
[Edgar] In that case I need you
to run an errand for us.

801
00:33:17.299 --> 00:33:18.648
What. you mean like

802
00:33:18.822 --> 00:33:19.867
leave the house?

803
00:33:20.041 --> 00:33:20.868
Yes.

804
00:33:21.042 --> 00:33:22.696
[toaster dinging]

805
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:24.785
Fuck.

806
00:33:24.959 --> 00:33:26.482
Okay. what?

807
00:33:26.656 --> 00:33:28.484
[Edgar] I need you to run
over to a Sani-Trade.

808
00:33:28.658 --> 00:33:30.530
[incredulous laugh]

809
00:33:30.704 --> 00:33:32.706
Oh come on man that's not still
a thing. Wrightcorp

810
00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:36.014
scrapped all of its sanitation
purchasing proxies years ago.

811
00:33:36.188 --> 00:33:38.364
There's no unauthorized trade
between infected and

812
00:33:38.538 --> 00:33:40.757
uninfected citizens.
-The black market didn't

813
00:33:40.931 --> 00:33:43.325
disappear just because the
government said so. Trust me.

814
00:33:43.499 --> 00:33:45.284
It's still a thing.

815
00:33:45.458 --> 00:33:46.546
[defeated sigh]

816
00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.026
Alright. where am I goin?

817
00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.680
I'm sending you the address
right now.

818
00:33:50.854 --> 00:33:52.334
[fork slamming]

819
00:33:52.508 --> 00:33:53.814
[rooster crowing] [chorus of
creepy voices]

820
00:33:53.988 --> 00:33:55.337
[sleepy. creepy voice] Early
Grave!

821
00:33:55.511 --> 00:33:57.644
[creepy voice] They're trying to
cut me!

822
00:33:57.818 --> 00:33:59.689
[Nova] Y'all. I been smacked by
beat cops and beat by

823
00:33:59.863 --> 00:34:01.387
smackhounds.

824
00:34:01.561 --> 00:34:04.259
I been slapped by a hooker and
kicked by my own mama.

825
00:34:04.433 --> 00:34:06.435
I spent years gettin' stabbed
and shot at

826
00:34:06.609 --> 00:34:08.350
runnin' with all kinds of
shady characters.

827
00:34:08.524 --> 00:34:09.917
Nova Grave has been around the
block

828
00:34:10.091 --> 00:34:11.745
a few damn times.

829
00:34:11.919 --> 00:34:14.139
So believe me when I tell y'all
that I ain't never seen

830
00:34:14.313 --> 00:34:15.705
a single one of these

831
00:34:15.879 --> 00:34:18.273
anti-corporate
militant socialist

832
00:34:18.447 --> 00:34:20.319
'People's Army' yahoos
the mainstream corpo media

833
00:34:20.493 --> 00:34:21.929
is always goin' on about.

834
00:34:22.103 --> 00:34:24.410
They do not exist.

835
00:34:24.584 --> 00:34:25.976
The People's Army graffiti?

836
00:34:26.151 --> 00:34:27.413
Corporate scare tactics.

837
00:34:27.587 --> 00:34:28.805
People's Army bombings?

838
00:34:28.979 --> 00:34:30.720
Planned demolitions.

839
00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:34.202
The Eastern Autonomous Zone?!
Shit. y'all that's just a place

840
00:34:34.376 --> 00:34:36.509
for the corp-gov city police
to dump bodies

841
00:34:36.683 --> 00:34:38.641
without havin' to file any
paperwork.

842
00:34:38.815 --> 00:34:40.165
I hate to be a downer folks

843
00:34:40.339 --> 00:34:42.471
but the people have no army.

844
00:34:42.645 --> 00:34:44.995
There's no one comin'
to save us. folks.

845
00:34:45.170 --> 00:34:46.649
And on that cheery note

846
00:34:46.823 --> 00:34:48.651
let's get back to the music.

847
00:34:48.825 --> 00:34:50.262
[jazzy music]
[outgoing dial tone]

848
00:34:50.436 --> 00:34:52.133
[receiver clicks]
[Edgar] What?!

849
00:34:52.307 --> 00:34:54.483
[James] Why are you sending me
to a residential district?

850
00:34:54.657 --> 00:34:56.659
[Edgar] Most of the houses
are abandoned.

851
00:34:56.833 --> 00:34:59.271
It's the perfect place to run a
middleman service like this.

852
00:34:59.445 --> 00:35:03.057
There's a Sani-Trade vending
machine hidden in the backyard.

853
00:35:03.231 --> 00:35:06.104
Infected delivery personnel
load the machine from

854
00:35:06.278 --> 00:35:07.627
underground and
transactions are handled by

855
00:35:07.801 --> 00:35:09.368
Black Market Buddha.

856
00:35:09.542 --> 00:35:11.109
[James] "Black Market Buddha"?

857
00:35:11.283 --> 00:35:13.023
[Edgar] It's the moniker for
the vending A.I.

858
00:35:13.198 --> 00:35:14.851
[James] Sounds offensive.

859
00:35:15.025 --> 00:35:16.766
[Edgar] Seems like it would be

860
00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.552
[chuckling] but the machine's
programming is faulty and

861
00:35:19.726 --> 00:35:21.206
it insists.

862
00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.250
He's...

863
00:35:22.424 --> 00:35:25.253
manageably insane.

864
00:35:29.475 --> 00:35:32.130
[digital warble]
[jazzy music fades]

865
00:35:35.959 --> 00:35:37.657
[digital clicks]

866
00:35:37.831 --> 00:35:39.572
[wind chimes]

867
00:35:40.486 --> 00:35:42.705
[airy button sound]
[mechanisms activate within]

868
00:35:42.879 --> 00:35:46.056
[welcoming startup theme]

869
00:35:46.231 --> 00:35:48.929
[Buddha][British] Have you come
for spiritual enlightenment?

870
00:35:49.103 --> 00:35:51.453
[James] Uh. no.
No. Electronics.

871
00:35:51.627 --> 00:35:53.673
[Buddha][British] Well. you
never know what you might find

872
00:35:53.847 --> 00:35:56.066
when you're looking in
all the wrong places.

873
00:35:56.241 --> 00:35:58.068
This isn't a Wrightcorp-run

874
00:35:58.243 --> 00:35:59.069
Sanitrade proxy. is it? I--

875
00:35:59.244 --> 00:36:00.897
[violent mechanical failure]

876
00:36:01.071 --> 00:36:03.161
[Buddha][Demonic] Down with
Wrightcorp! Anarchy! Anarchy!!

877
00:36:03.335 --> 00:36:04.858
[glitchy transformation]

878
00:36:05.032 --> 00:36:06.860
[Buddha][British] [clears
throat] Pardon me. No no.

879
00:36:07.034 --> 00:36:09.558
This facility has been
salvaged and repurposed.

880
00:36:09.732 --> 00:36:11.212
And is now under the
management of a rather

881
00:36:11.386 --> 00:36:12.735
different organization.

882
00:36:12.909 --> 00:36:14.346
That's good. [nervous chuckle]

883
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.826
[Buddha][Cockney] You cheeky
bastard.

884
00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.306
Okay. Um...

885
00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:19.916
You sell electronics
though don't you?

886
00:36:20.090 --> 00:36:22.658
[Buddha][Scottish] Of course we
sell electronics! Who's askin?!

887
00:36:22.832 --> 00:36:23.877
Oh! I'm sorry. Uh--

888
00:36:24.051 --> 00:36:25.705
Edgar! Edgar sent me.

889
00:36:25.879 --> 00:36:27.881
[Buddha][British] Oh yes Edgar!
One of our very best clients.

890
00:36:28.055 --> 00:36:29.665
Do send him our best.

891
00:36:29.839 --> 00:36:31.493
[polite chuckle] I will. Thanks.
Umm...

892
00:36:31.667 --> 00:36:33.713
So anyway I need three
variable-connect

893
00:36:33.887 --> 00:36:35.584
Spydir-class remote patch units.

894
00:36:35.758 --> 00:36:38.239
[Buddha][Cockney] And why do you
need three variable-connect

895
00:36:38.413 --> 00:36:40.285
Spydir-class remote patch units?

896
00:36:40.459 --> 00:36:42.156
Uh-- because Edgar needs them.

897
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:44.593
[Buddha][Cockney] Nooo but why
do you need

898
00:36:44.767 --> 00:36:47.857
three variable-connect
Spydir-class remote patch units?

899
00:36:48.031 --> 00:36:50.208
For Edgar.

900
00:36:52.906 --> 00:36:55.169
I'm sorry I don't think I
understand the question.

901
00:36:55.343 --> 00:36:57.998
[Buddha][British] My dear boy.
the man who embraces the leash

902
00:36:58.172 --> 00:37:00.348
will one day find that he is
no more than a dog.

903
00:37:00.522 --> 00:37:02.176
Uh. well I have no idea what
that means.

904
00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:03.438
But thank you for the insight.

905
00:37:03.612 --> 00:37:05.919
[Buddha][Cockney] [guffaw]
Woof!!

906
00:37:06.093 --> 00:37:07.399
[labored sigh] Okay.

907
00:37:07.573 --> 00:37:09.227
Listen. Edgar needs the three
Spydir units.

908
00:37:09.401 --> 00:37:11.620
I can't have them mailed to my
current address

909
00:37:11.794 --> 00:37:13.622
and this is the only place that
I can buy black market tech

910
00:37:13.796 --> 00:37:15.711
without risking exposing myself
to ACHE

911
00:37:15.885 --> 00:37:17.974
and coughing up blood until I
die. so--

912
00:37:18.148 --> 00:37:20.629
[Buddha][Scottish] Ah. don't
worry! If you catch ACHE

913
00:37:20.803 --> 00:37:22.762
you'll only probably cough up
blood until you die!

914
00:37:22.936 --> 00:37:24.590
[hearty guffaw]

915
00:37:24.764 --> 00:37:28.855
[polite. tired guffaw] I'll
pass. So. um...

916
00:37:29.029 --> 00:37:30.944
Spy.dir units?

917
00:37:31.118 --> 00:37:33.425
[confirmation tune]
[object dispensing]

918
00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:35.818
[Buddha][British] Product

919
00:37:35.992 --> 00:37:38.038
[Buddha][Scottish] Well are ya
gonna grab the thing

920
00:37:38.212 --> 00:37:39.996
or ain't ya?
-Oh. uh. Yeah.

921

924
00:37:52.531 --> 00:37:53.401
Cute.

925
00:37:53.575 --> 00:37:54.576
Thank you.

926
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:56.012
[shutdown tune]
Yum yum.

927
00:37:56.186 --> 00:37:58.101
[lamp clanging]
Ahh!

928
00:37:58.276 --> 00:37:59.625
[defeated sigh]

935
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:44.452
Uh... okay.

936
00:38:44.626 --> 00:38:45.845
[Ayla] Ten...

937
00:38:46.019 --> 00:38:47.455
[James] Ten what?

938
00:38:47.629 --> 00:38:49.457
[Ayla] Nine...

939
00:38:49.631 --> 00:38:51.154
Eight...
-Is this some kind of game?

940
00:38:51.329 --> 00:38:52.808
Yes. Seven...

941
00:38:52.982 --> 00:38:54.810
What if I die or get erased or--
-You won't. Six...

942
00:38:54.984 --> 00:38:56.769
-How do you know?
-I programmed it that way.

943
00:38:56.943 --> 00:38:58.248
Five...

944
00:38:58.423 --> 00:38:59.772
[Ayla] Four...

945
00:38:59.946 --> 00:39:00.947
Okay well what am I supposed
to-- am I--

946
00:39:01.121 --> 00:39:03.515
[Ayla] Three...

947
00:39:03.689 --> 00:39:04.994
[gun charging]
AYLA: Two. one!!

00:39:05.168 --> 00:39:07.693
[laser gunshot]

00:39:10.652 --> 00:39:12.045

JAMES: [gasp]

950
00:39:12.219 --> 00:39:13.568
Hey!!

951
00:39:13.742 --> 00:39:15.483
Come on!!
[Ayla] [imitating bird] Cuh-caw!

952
00:39:15.657 --> 00:39:17.355
[distant laser shot]
[shot collision]

953
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:22.229
[Ayla] Where would you want to
live?

954
00:39:22.403 --> 00:39:24.449
If you were a real boy?

955
00:39:24.623 --> 00:39:26.886
Mmm. Probably Wright Station.

956
00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:29.018
Oh god! Why?

957
00:39:29.192 --> 00:39:30.498
I don't know.

958
00:39:30.672 --> 00:39:32.674
It's safe.

959
00:39:32.848 --> 00:39:35.416
There's good air.

960
00:39:35.590 --> 00:39:38.376
Nobody's sick.

961
00:39:41.074 --> 00:39:43.511
It's really bad isn't it?

962
00:39:49.865 --> 00:39:51.693
I'm really lucky.

963
00:39:51.867 --> 00:39:53.869
Well. you're a good person.

964
00:39:54.043 --> 00:39:56.176
you deserve good things.
-It's easy to be good

965
00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:58.134
when nothing bad has ever
happened to you.

966
00:39:58.308 --> 00:40:00.006
[James] Well...

967
00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.138
In my experience there aren't an
overabundance of good people.

968
00:40:02.312 --> 00:40:03.575
So--
-Well I'm sure that

969
00:40:03.749 --> 00:40:05.272
optimism isn't exactly
a useful tool

970
00:40:05.446 --> 00:40:06.708
for a security system.

971
00:40:06.882 --> 00:40:08.362
Touché

972
00:40:08.536 --> 00:40:11.670
[Ayla] People change when
they're scared.

973
00:40:12.584 --> 00:40:14.194
I mean. I haven't lived down
there.

974
00:40:14.368 --> 00:40:16.718
All the history of the world
I've learned from

975
00:40:16.892 --> 00:40:18.328
lessons on a screen.

976
00:40:18.503 --> 00:40:21.723
which I'm sure has been colored
by some perspective.

977
00:40:21.897 --> 00:40:23.116
But I'd imagine

978
00:40:23.290 --> 00:40:24.726
that in addition to having a

979
00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.424
chronic. life-threatening
illness...

980
00:40:28.643 --> 00:40:29.905
it would be crushing

981
00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:32.560
to live in a world where you are
told

982
00:40:32.734 --> 00:40:34.606
where to go

983
00:40:34.780 --> 00:40:37.173
what job you can do. who you can
see. where

984
00:40:37.347 --> 00:40:40.133
everything that you do

985
00:40:40.307 --> 00:40:43.005
is restricted to a bunch of
zones based off a diagnosis

986
00:40:43.179 --> 00:40:45.791
that has labeled you for life.

987
00:40:48.663 --> 00:40:50.926
I've spent a lot of time up here

988
00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.015
by myself.

989
00:40:53.189 --> 00:40:54.800
And when I first got here

990
00:40:54.974 --> 00:40:59.108
I spent most of my time
doing things for myself.

991
00:40:59.282 --> 00:41:00.719
Painting.

992
00:41:00.893 --> 00:41:02.982
Composing. Playing video games.

993
00:41:03.156 --> 00:41:05.941
Dabbling in poetry.

994
00:41:06.115 --> 00:41:07.421
[Ayla] But after awhile

995
00:41:07.595 --> 00:41:08.988
doing all those things for
myself

996
00:41:09.162 --> 00:41:12.470
just made me feel way more
isolated.

997
00:41:13.906 --> 00:41:17.387
I stare down at that huge. wide
world

998
00:41:17.562 --> 00:41:21.479
this massive society that
doesn't even know I exist

999
00:41:23.959 --> 00:41:27.267
and I want to do something.

1000
00:41:27.441 --> 00:41:29.835
Something good.

1001
00:41:30.009 --> 00:41:33.621
I have the time. I have the
resources...

1002
00:41:42.456 --> 00:41:45.067
I wish more people were like
you.

1003
00:41:49.507 --> 00:41:51.421
[James] [sniff]

1004
00:41:51.596 --> 00:41:54.294
Where would you wanna live?

1005
00:41:57.210 --> 00:42:00.213
I don't know.

1006
00:42:00.387 --> 00:42:03.303

1014
00:43:05.539 --> 00:43:07.715
[James] Okay the Spy.dir I'm
sending should allow you remote

1015
00:43:07.889 --> 00:43:10.588
access to Ayla's pod. You'll
have full control so. you know.

1016
00:43:10.762 --> 00:43:12.502
you can gather whatever
information you want.

1017
00:43:12.677 --> 00:43:14.679
[Edgar] Great. Bring the devices
pre-programmed to

1018
00:43:14.853 --> 00:43:16.985
Black Market Buddha. And...

1019
00:43:17.159 --> 00:43:18.944
on the way. I need you to do
another job for me.

[digital window opening]

1021
00:43:20.728 --> 00:43:22.338
[James] Whoa whoa whoa. why am I
doing this?

1022
00:43:22.512 --> 00:43:24.514
[Edgar] You're the only asset
that we have with

1023
00:43:24.689 --> 00:43:26.255
a non-exposure license.

1024
00:43:26.429 --> 00:43:27.735
None of my people can even
enter the district

much less the building.

1026
00:43:29.302 --> 00:43:31.217
[James] Right. but... why?

1027
00:43:31.391 --> 00:43:33.480
[Edgar] Because there's another
two million in it for you?

1028
00:43:33.654 --> 00:43:34.960
[James] [labored sigh]

1029
00:43:35.134 --> 00:43:36.396
[Edgar] What's going on with
you?

1030
00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:38.311
Why are you suddenly asking
questions?

1031
00:43:38.485 --> 00:43:41.749
-I thought you trusted me. man.
-I do trust you. James.

1032
00:43:41.923 --> 00:43:43.490
[Edgar] I'm just trying to
protect you.

1033
00:43:43.664 --> 00:43:44.970
[James] Yeah. Woof.

1034
00:43:45.144 --> 00:43:46.275
[Edgar] Sorry what was that?

1035
00:43:46.449 --> 00:43:47.755
[James] Nothing.

1036
00:43:47.929 --> 00:43:49.235
[Edgar] Right.

1037
00:43:49.409 --> 00:43:50.715
Do your thing. get in and take
the

1038

elevator to the lowest level.

1039
00:43:52.717 --> 00:43:54.980
You'll need priority clearance
to access the testing bunker

underneath the building.

1041
00:43:56.851 --> 00:43:58.592
[James] Ok. and what are they
testing exactly?

1042
00:43:58.766 --> 00:44:00.550
-Need-to-know.
-Of course.

1043
00:44:00.725 --> 00:44:02.596
[Edgar] Our guy inside was able
to leave the package for you.

1044
00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:05.251
It's located on one of the
weapons testing platforms.

1045
00:44:05.425 --> 00:44:07.427
[James] Oh sure. that's
a safe place to leave it.

1046
00:44:07.601 --> 00:44:08.994
[Edgar] Shouldn't be hard to
find.

1047
00:44:09.168 --> 00:44:11.039
Grab it. and bring it to Black
Market Buddha.

1048
00:44:11.213 --> 00:44:12.998

Do you know what this is?

1088
00:46:16.599 --> 00:46:17.296
Uh...

1089
00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:18.688
Yeah it's a--

1090
00:46:18.863 --> 00:46:19.820
[Garnet] It's a compact

1091
00:46:19.994 --> 00:46:21.256
matter condenser prototype.

1092
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:22.257
Yeah. Right...

1093
00:46:22.431 --> 00:46:23.302
Obviously.

00:46:23.476 --> 00:46:25.086
Who do you work for?

1095
00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:26.958
Ooooh. Ya know honestly I kinda

1096
00:46:27.132 --> 00:46:29.787
consider myself an independent
contractor. Andrew.

1097
00:46:31.571 --> 00:46:33.791
Just... gimme the grav--
Gimme the gravity thing.

1098
00:46:35.053 --> 00:46:37.142
You're not gonna shoot me.

1099
00:46:37.316 --> 00:46:39.144
I will too shoot you!

1100
00:46:39.318 --> 00:46:40.580
-No you won't.
-Yes I will.

1101
00:46:40.754 --> 00:46:42.277
You don't even know
how to fight.

1102
00:46:42.451 --> 00:46:44.105
[intense scoff] Look who's
talking!

1103
00:46:44.279 --> 00:46:45.541
[Garnet] Listen...

1104
00:46:45.715 --> 00:46:48.675
I can't let you leave here
with this.

1105
00:46:49.545 --> 00:46:51.025
Look just tell them I came in
here

1106
00:46:51.199 --> 00:46:53.158
guns blazing
overpowered you and took off.

1107
00:46:53.332 --> 00:46:55.203
I'll tie you to a chair or
something!

1108
00:46:55.377 --> 00:46:57.466
Look I'm sure your corporate
overlords will understand.

1109
00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.338
No. They won't.

1110
00:46:59.512 --> 00:47:01.340
I could lose everything.
My job. my pension

1111
00:47:01.514 --> 00:47:02.341
my insurance.

1112
00:47:02.515 --> 00:47:04.256
Oh?! You get insurance??

1113
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:06.911
[Garnet] They can come
after my family...

1114
00:47:07.085 --> 00:47:08.173
What?

1115
00:47:08.347 --> 00:47:10.131
[Garnet] It's not unheard of.

1116
00:47:10.305 --> 00:47:12.307
There have been stories.

1117
00:47:12.481 --> 00:47:14.092
Jesus. man.

1118
00:47:14.266 --> 00:47:16.703
And these are the kind of people
you're gonna take a bullet for?

1119
00:47:16.877 --> 00:47:18.357
Listen. it's not just them.

1120
00:47:18.531 --> 00:47:19.532
It's this.

1121
00:47:19.706 --> 00:47:20.663
This is not a toy.

1122
00:47:20.838 --> 00:47:22.143
Yeah. I'm well aware.

1123
00:47:22.317 --> 00:47:24.624
[Garnet] No you don't
seem very aware!

1124
00:47:24.798 --> 00:47:27.192
If this thing is activated
under the wrong circumstances

1125
00:47:27.366 --> 00:47:29.847
it could implode a city block!

1126
00:47:31.283 --> 00:47:32.675
Really?

1127
00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.677
[Garnet] Really. But it won't
hurt anyone

1128
00:47:34.852 --> 00:47:36.984
if it stays in the right hands.

1129
00:47:37.158 --> 00:47:38.420
[scoff] Yeah.

1130
00:47:38.594 --> 00:47:41.380
And those hands would be
Wrightcorp's?

1131
00:47:44.339 --> 00:47:46.124
Look...

1132
00:47:46.298 --> 00:47:48.735
either way it's my job to fetch
that box

1133
00:47:48.909 --> 00:47:50.215
and one way or another

1134
00:47:50.389 --> 00:47:53.000
I'm leaving with it.

1135
00:47:56.003 --> 00:47:57.744
[James] You really wanna take
advantage of that

1136
00:47:57.918 --> 00:47:59.441
WrightTech insurance policy

1137
00:47:59.615 --> 00:48:01.966
just to protect a piece of
corporate hardware?

1138
00:48:05.708 --> 00:48:08.189
Come on. man.

1139
00:48:12.759 --> 00:48:14.848
No.

1140
00:48:22.943 --> 00:48:24.031

trigger doesn't mean your hands

1147

1155

[success chime]

1157
00:49:05.290 --> 00:49:06.813

friend in the dark is better

1158
00:49:06.987 --> 00:49:08.293
than walking alone in the light.

1159
00:49:08.467 --> 00:49:09.685
[chuckling] yeah. Woof woof.

don't even know

Why do you work for Edgar?

1174
00:49:41.152 --> 00:49:43.284
[Buddha][Scottish] Oh. Buddha
doesn't work for the

1175
00:49:43.458 --> 00:49:44.938

himself!

1176

Army!

[Buddha][Cockney] Oopsie.

1185

They're a terrorist
organization!

1186
00:50:05.393 --> 00:50:07.656
[Buddha][Scottish] Well. one

I'll allow it.

1319
00:57:20.828 --> 00:57:23.309
[James] It's just that I thought
of an answer to your question

1320
00:57:23.483 --> 00:57:25.659
from earlier. About... you
know. what it feels like

1321

[James] Well...

1324
00:57:30.055 --> 00:57:32.013
I don't think being unplugged
is the same as what you would

1325
00:57:32.187 --> 00:57:34.189
experience. I mean I've been
rebooted and repurposed

1326
00:57:34.363 --> 00:57:36.278
countless times. It sort of
loses its novelty

1327
00:57:36.453 --> 00:57:38.324
after awhile.
-Oh. okay.

1328
00:57:38.498 --> 00:57:41.153
[James] But there's a lot of
stuff rolling around in my head

1329
00:57:41.327 --> 00:57:43.329
from previous jobs that I've
been put to

1330
00:57:43.503 --> 00:57:45.679
and I do have one outstanding
memory from my time as a

1331
00:57:45.853 --> 00:57:47.072
footage irregularity monitor

1332
00:57:47.246 --> 00:57:48.682

1333
00:57:48.856 --> 00:57:50.902
Footage irregularity monitor?

1334
00:57:51.076 --> 00:57:52.904
[James] Yeah...

1335
00:57:53.078 --> 00:57:54.775
You know some A.I.s can be use
to sabotage or fake security

1336
00:57:54.949 --> 00:57:57.299
footage so another A.I. has to
be put in place in order to--

1337
00:57:57.474 --> 00:57:59.780
Got it. [chuckle]
-Right.

1338
00:57:59.954 --> 00:58:01.956
[James] Anyway... I have a
memory.

1339
00:58:02.130 --> 00:58:05.656
A... fragmented memory from
that job of a young man

1340
00:58:05.830 --> 00:58:07.701
Twenty-something maybe?

1341
00:58:07.875 --> 00:58:10.574
The dossier I got from his face
scan showed that he'd already

1342
00:58:10.748 --> 00:58:13.620
watched his father and sister
die from ACHE complications in

1343
00:58:13.794 --> 00:58:15.970
the same hospital that week.
-Jesus...

1344
00:58:16.144 --> 00:58:18.973
[James] And I watched as he was
talking to his mother remotely.

1345
00:58:19.147 --> 00:58:22.629
Just like the rest of his famiy
she had to be quarantined.

1346
00:58:23.543 --> 00:58:25.502
So anyway he's talking to her
from a computer

1347
00:58:25.676 --> 00:58:27.721
in the waiting room.

1348
00:58:29.331 --> 00:58:32.291
And I remember this kid

1349
00:58:32.465 --> 00:58:33.510
watching his mother

1350
00:58:33.684 --> 00:58:36.295
the last member of his family

1351
00:58:36.469 --> 00:58:38.906
die.

1352
00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:40.168
[James] He told her

1353
00:58:40.342 --> 00:58:41.953
I'm scared. Mom.

1354
00:58:42.127 --> 00:58:43.911
I don't want you to go.

1355
00:58:44.085 --> 00:58:45.739
And she said...

1356
00:58:45.913 --> 00:58:50.265
[sigh] Her vocal cords sounded
like razor blades. but...

1357
00:58:50.439 --> 00:58:53.225
She said. "I'm scared too
James."

1358
00:58:54.443 --> 00:58:56.707
And I don't want to go either.

1359
00:58:57.621 --> 00:59:00.014
But I know it's not me that's
going.

1360
00:59:01.494 --> 00:59:04.192
All that I am is all that I've
done

1361
00:59:04.366 --> 00:59:07.108
here on this planet.

1362
00:59:07.282 --> 00:59:09.850
I always wanted to leave this
place better than I found it

1363
00:59:10.024 --> 00:59:12.331
and when I leave
you behind...

1364
00:59:12.505 --> 00:59:15.508
I leaveyou behind.

1365
00:59:16.422 --> 00:59:19.251
And I can rest easy knowing
that.

1366
00:59:21.862 --> 00:59:24.038
I hope she can.

1367
00:59:28.129 --> 00:59:30.262

1368
00:59:34.527 --> 00:59:37.051

in charge!

1375

What?!

1376
01:00:14.045 --> 01:00:16.090
If I tell you to do a job then
you'd better finish it.

1377
01:00:16.264 --> 01:00:18.484
You put the box in the machine!
There is nothing to discuss!

1378
01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:20.094
Who do you think you are?!

1379
01:00:20.268 --> 01:00:22.619
I think I'm the guy who's doing
everything for you. so--

1380
01:00:22.793 --> 01:00:25.709
[Edgar] You're a gifted guy. but
there's a hundred people

1381
01:00:25.883 --> 01:00:28.494
talented as you who would bend
over backward to do the work

1382
01:00:28.668 --> 01:00:30.931
I handed you.
-Okay. Look--

1383
01:00:31.105 --> 01:00:33.064
[Edgar] And for what I'm
paying you. you prick...

1384
01:00:33.238 --> 01:00:35.153
So I send you on an errand.
you do it!

1385
01:00:35.327 --> 01:00:37.634
An errand?! I could've been
thrown in prison with acheys and

1386
01:00:37.808 --> 01:00:39.374
had my rights stripped away!

1387
01:00:39.548 --> 01:00:41.638
[Edgar] Oh. cry me a river.
-So I can put weapons in the

[James] You okay?

1395
01:00:57.001 --> 01:00:58.480
[Edgar] Yeah. I'll be fine. Look

1396
01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:00.744
you'll get your money and then
some.

1397
01:01:00.918 --> 01:01:02.441
Just hand over the gravity
condenser.

1398
01:01:02.615 --> 01:01:04.573
[Edgar] Besides. I have another
job for you.

1399
01:01:04.748 --> 01:01:06.271
No I'm not doin' another job for
you.

1400
01:01:06.445 --> 01:01:08.969
[Edgar] Stop the hardball shit.
kid. you're not good at it.

1401
01:01:09.143 --> 01:01:11.319
Besides. all you have to do is
not do something.

1402
01:01:11.493 --> 01:01:13.670
What are you talking about?

1403
01:01:13.844 --> 01:01:15.584
We're gonna ground the girl.

1404
01:01:15.759 --> 01:01:18.544
Ground her?!
-Think about the payday

1405
01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:22.243
when we ransom her.

1406
01:01:22.417 --> 01:01:23.680
No. No.

1407
01:01:23.854 --> 01:01:24.855
That was not part of the plan.

1408
01:01:25.029 --> 01:01:26.595
Oh no?

1409
01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:29.207
What was the plan. then?
[James] I don't know. you said

1410
01:01:29.381 --> 01:01:31.949
you wanted to steal from Wright!
Like a heist or something!

1411
01:01:32.123 --> 01:01:34.299
[Edgar] And you practically
bagged her up and brought her

1412
01:01:34.473 --> 01:01:36.562
to us.

1413
01:01:36.736 --> 01:01:38.999
[Edgar] Once the Spy.dir arrives
at her pod

1414
01:01:39.173 --> 01:01:42.350
we'll have remote access. We
can land her wherever we want.

1415
01:01:42.524 --> 01:01:44.962
[James] No. that pod wasn't
designed for that. okay?

1416
01:01:45.136 --> 01:01:47.138
[Edgar] No. but it was designed
to keep her safe

1417
01:01:47.312 --> 01:01:48.356
and that's all we want.

1418
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:49.706
[Edgar] We'll rescue her

1419
01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.925
safe and sound from the crash
site

1420
01:01:52.099 --> 01:01:54.972
and you're not gonna tell her a
thing.

1421
01:01:55.146 --> 01:01:56.756
for both your sakes.

1422
01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:58.540
[James] No. you can't do this.

1423
01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.412
[Edgar] Why?

1424
01:02:00.586 --> 01:02:02.327
[James] Because she-- she's
working on a-- a. a thing.

1425
01:02:02.501 --> 01:02:04.372
[Edgar] You'll have to be more
specific...

1426
01:02:04.546 --> 01:02:06.374
She's building a fusion engine.
okay?!

1427
01:02:06.548 --> 01:02:08.812
[James] She's working on a
prototype for--

1428
01:02:08.986 --> 01:02:11.379
She's trying to make things
better for people down here!!

1429
01:02:11.553 --> 01:02:14.426
I'm trying to make things better
for people down here! We're

1430
01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.949
trying to make things better!

1431
01:02:16.123 --> 01:02:17.298
She's a Wright. James!

1432
01:02:17.472 --> 01:02:19.605
Okay. look...

1433
01:02:19.779 --> 01:02:21.520
I didn't get into this to hurt
people. okay?

1434
01:02:21.694 --> 01:02:23.391
That's not me.

1435
01:02:23.565 --> 01:02:25.916
[Edgar] Well that's the burden
of privilege. Jimmy.

Honey! I thought I told you not
to call me on this number

01:02:33.967 --> 01:02:35.752
unless it was an emergency!
-I've done it!

1441
01:02:35.926 --> 01:02:37.971
-Done what?
-I got the simulation to

1442
01:02:38.145 --> 01:02:39.799
stabilize. Real world tech and
physics!

1443
01:02:39.973 --> 01:02:41.192
What?

1444
01:02:41.366 --> 01:02:43.803
I've built a working fusion
engine!

1445
01:02:43.977 --> 01:02:45.152
I don't think so. darling.

1446
01:02:45.326 --> 01:02:47.459
I sent you the tests!

[Ayla] So?

1450
01:02:59.732 --> 01:03:01.168
What do you think?

1451
01:03:01.342 --> 01:03:02.561
[Wright] Darling. I--

1452
01:03:02.735 --> 01:03:05.129
This is incredible.

1453
01:03:05.303 --> 01:03:07.044
You did this?

1454
01:03:07.218 --> 01:03:09.220
I did.
[Wright] But how did you--

1455
01:03:09.394 --> 01:03:12.049
[Ayla] Well I had access to all
the company's research up until

1456
01:03:12.223 --> 01:03:14.051
we stopped working on the
project in '54.

1457
01:03:14.225 --> 01:03:15.661
So I just

1458
01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:18.229
transferred everything to my
Worldsim program.

1459
01:03:18.403 --> 01:03:19.883
I didn't realize we were this
close

1460
01:03:20.057 --> 01:03:22.146
before I decided to pull the
project.

1461
01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.802
[Ayla] What?

1462
01:03:25.976 --> 01:03:27.716
We can't show anybody this

1463
01:03:27.891 --> 01:03:30.197
but I am proud of you.
-Well obviously we can't share

1464
01:03:30.371 --> 01:03:31.459
it with anybody yet. but--

1465
01:03:31.633 --> 01:03:32.939
[Wright] I love you

1466
01:03:33.113 --> 01:03:34.941
and you have to know I am so
proud of you.

1467
01:03:35.115 --> 01:03:36.813
Look...

1468
01:03:36.987 --> 01:03:39.250
I understand that it's too
important to go into production

1469
01:03:39.424 --> 01:03:41.252
based off of some sims. but

1470
01:03:41.426 --> 01:03:44.081
if we patent this process and we
prove that it works

1471
01:03:44.255 --> 01:03:46.170
on the ground in real life

1472
01:03:46.344 --> 01:03:48.433
then we actually have a chance
of moving forward with--

1473
01:03:48.607 --> 01:03:50.304
The problem is not your engine.
darling.

1474
01:03:50.478 --> 01:03:52.437
The problem is people--

Your mother always thought of
our company as trying to win

1478

some victory for all of
creation.

1479
01:04:07.408 --> 01:04:10.847
She loved people.

1480
01:04:11.021 --> 01:04:14.154
Often I'm glad she passed when
she did.

1481
01:04:14.328 --> 01:04:17.854
[Wright] Before Earth became
what it is today.

1482
01:04:18.028 --> 01:04:20.900
Before people showed their true
colors.

1483
01:04:23.642 --> 01:04:25.296
[Wright] But it's beautiful

1484
01:04:25.470 --> 01:04:28.560
seeing that same naive look
in your eyes.

Dad

1486
01:04:32.259 --> 01:04:34.522

live down there.

1487

You can't paint everybody with
the same brush!

1488
01:04:36.873 --> 01:04:39.310
Honey. you just don't know.
-I do!

1489
01:04:39.484 --> 01:04:41.965
Darion told me! He told me all
about the suffering.

1490
01:04:42.139 --> 01:04:44.141
About how hard it was at the--
-Wait. wait wait wait.

The A.I.

1493
01:04:46.926 --> 01:04:48.493
[Wright] Your A.I. is CARON.

1494
01:04:48.667 --> 01:04:51.235
[Ayla] No! The--

1495
01:04:51.409 --> 01:04:53.759
The gift you sent me.

1496
01:04:53.933 --> 01:04:56.762
The A.I. that you embedded
in my simulation?

1497
01:04:56.936 --> 01:04:59.199
[Ayla] The security monitor!
-Honey. have you been

1498
01:04:59.373 --> 01:05:01.332
talking to someone inside of
your game?

1499
01:05:01.506 --> 01:05:03.725
It's a private network. No one
should be able to--

1500
01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:06.728
No I know but he said that you--
-If you've been interacting with

1501
01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:09.166
an outside user inside your
game. I have to disable your

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:11.559
account. And I need to wipe the
entire network!

1503
01:05:11.733 --> 01:05:13.083
No! Dad! You can't do that!

1504
01:05:13.257 --> 01:05:14.954
I will lose everything!

1505
01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:17.783
Well I can't lose you!

1506
01:05:20.568 --> 01:05:21.918

01:09:59.499 --> 01:10:00.805
[Edgar] And how are you
going to do that?

1596
01:10:00.979 --> 01:10:02.415
You don't know where we are.

1597
01:10:02.589 --> 01:10:04.069
You don't have a plan.

1598
01:10:04.243 --> 01:10:05.636
You can't do anything by
yourself.

1599
01:10:05.810 --> 01:10:06.811
I trusted you!

1600
01:10:06.985 --> 01:10:08.204
[Edgar] I trustedyou.

1601
01:10:08.378 --> 01:10:09.814
We trusted you.

1602
01:10:09.988 --> 01:10:11.903
While you were off in wondersim
playing peekaboo

1603
01:10:12.077 --> 01:10:14.427
with your pretend girlfriend.

1604
01:10:14.601 --> 01:10:15.994
You saw all that?

1605
01:10:16.168 --> 01:10:17.648
[Edgar] Shouldn't be that
surprised.

1606
01:10:17.822 --> 01:10:20.172
You gave us full access.

1607
01:10:20.346 --> 01:10:22.957
This was all your plan.

1608
01:10:24.045 --> 01:10:25.569
You're gonna hurt her aren't
you?

1609
01:10:25.743 --> 01:10:27.875
[Edgar] Not if Wright
cooperates.

1610
01:10:28.049 --> 01:10:30.313
While he's busy firing all his
private security and building

1611
01:10:30.487 --> 01:10:33.098
new firewalls. we'll land her
pod on Earth

1612
01:10:33.272 --> 01:10:35.318
and arrange a trade.
-No. Edgar. I told you

1613
01:10:35.492 --> 01:10:37.929
that pod was not designed
to reenter the atmosphere!

1614
01:10:38.103 --> 01:10:40.366
[Edgar] She'll get to Earth
one way or another.

1615
01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:42.412
This girl is more than a payday.
Edgar. okay?!

1616
01:10:42.586 --> 01:10:44.501
She's important!

1617
01:10:44.675 --> 01:10:46.503
[Edgar] She's up in a pod in
fucking space playing a video

1618
01:10:46.677 --> 01:10:48.635
game while billions of people
rot beneath her in an

1619
01:10:48.809 --> 01:10:50.594
apocalyptic soup.

1620
01:10:50.768 --> 01:10:53.074
You have nothing in common
with her. James.

1621
01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:54.467
Why don't you join us down here

1622
01:10:54.641 --> 01:10:56.513
in reality?

1623
01:10:56.687 --> 01:10:58.254
Your future is here

1624
01:10:58.428 --> 01:11:00.299
where millions of people
are starving and suffering

1625
01:11:00.473 --> 01:11:02.606
and dying for change.

1626
01:11:02.780 --> 01:11:04.521
You're not gonna choose your
own self-interest

1627
01:11:04.695 --> 01:11:06.131
over peoples' lives.

1628
01:11:06.305 --> 01:11:08.481
[James] I am not the one acting
own self-interest.

1629
01:11:08.655 --> 01:11:11.571
Helping Ayla would create real.
lasting change.

1630
01:11:11.745 --> 01:11:14.139
Her engine could basically
provide free energy for

1631
01:11:14.313 --> 01:11:16.359
everyone. It would upend
Wrightcorp entirely!

1632
01:11:16.533 --> 01:11:19.144
You could save every single one
of your employees from getting

1633
01:11:19.318 --> 01:11:21.538
radiation sickness. but instead
you're gonna choose petty

1634
01:11:21.712 --> 01:11:22.974
retaliation!

1635
01:11:23.148 --> 01:11:24.497
This girl is not her father!!

1636
01:11:24.671 --> 01:11:26.238
[Edgar] I don't care!

1637
01:11:26.412 --> 01:11:28.545
Change doesn't come from above.

1638
01:11:28.719 --> 01:11:32.200
And promises don't drain the
blood from your lungs.

1639
01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:34.159
The only path to justice is if
they realize

1640
01:11:34.333 --> 01:11:37.336
they are exactly the same
as us.

1641
01:11:38.903 --> 01:11:41.949
You're gonna give her ACHE.
aren't you?

1642
01:11:42.123 --> 01:11:43.864
That's the endgame here?

1643
01:11:44.038 --> 01:11:45.649
[Edgar] They need to see this
affect one of their own.

1644
01:11:45.823 --> 01:11:47.477
No. Edgar.

1645
01:11:47.651 --> 01:11:49.392
Wright is not gonna change
anything that he's doing. Not

1646
01:11:49.566 --> 01:11:51.219
for his daughter. not for
anyone.

1647
01:11:51.394 --> 01:11:53.744
[Edgar] Then we will expose him
to the world as the monster

1648
01:11:53.918 --> 01:11:55.963
that he really is.
-The world doesn't even know she

1649
01:11:56.137 --> 01:11:58.966
exists. He's just going to deny
it publicly. and then he's going

1650
01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:00.968
to come after you!
-Be done with this. James.

1651
01:12:01.142 --> 01:12:02.709
One day you'll see

1652
01:12:02.883 --> 01:12:04.972
that you were on the right
side of history.

1653
01:12:05.146 --> 01:12:08.193
Edgar. you-- [call disconnects]

Ayla?

1668
01:12:56.459 --> 01:12:57.590
I trusted you.

1669
01:12:57.764 --> 01:12:59.113
And you lied to me.

1670
01:12:59.287 --> 01:13:00.419
[James] I know. I'm sorry--

1671
01:13:00.593 --> 01:13:03.422
I don't want your apology. I--

1672
01:13:03.596 --> 01:13:06.512
I want you to be real.

1673
01:13:06.686 --> 01:13:08.688
[James] I am real. I--

1674
01:13:08.862 --> 01:13:10.908
What do you mean?

1675
01:13:11.082 --> 01:13:15.565
You were just using me to get to
my father.

1676
01:13:15.739 --> 01:13:16.783
I don't know what I was doing.

1677
01:13:16.957 --> 01:13:18.698
I-- I never know what I'm doing.

1678
01:13:18.872 --> 01:13:20.657
How can you 'not know'
what you're doing?!

1679
01:13:20.831 --> 01:13:22.093
That is a terrible excuse.

1680
01:13:22.267 --> 01:13:23.834
[James] I know. I know.

1681
01:13:24.008 --> 01:13:25.749
But I am real.

1682
01:13:25.923 --> 01:13:27.359
And I want to fix things.

1683
01:13:34.105 --> 01:13:37.630
My whole life's work...

1684
01:13:37.804 --> 01:13:40.764
was for nothing.

1685
01:13:40.938 --> 01:13:42.069
[James] No. Ayla. that's...

1686
01:13:42.243 --> 01:13:43.070
no...

1687
01:13:43.244 --> 01:13:45.682
no. I backed it all up.

1688
01:13:45.856 --> 01:13:46.422
What?!

1689
01:13:46.596 --> 01:13:47.945
[James] Yeah!

1690
01:13:48.119 --> 01:13:50.600
All your stuff about the fusion
reactor is here!

1691
01:13:50.774 --> 01:13:53.124
I made copies of all your
research. prototypes...

1692
01:13:53.298 --> 01:13:54.430
It's all gibberish to me but

1693
01:13:54.604 --> 01:13:55.866
I've got it!

1694
01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:58.956
Really?!
-And some of the paintings.

1695
01:13:59.130 --> 01:14:01.349
Most of the "blue period"...

1696
01:14:01.524 --> 01:14:04.788
Why did you save my work?

1697
01:14:04.962 --> 01:14:06.746
I was gonna sell it.

1698
01:14:11.882 --> 01:14:12.709
What's your name?

1699
01:14:12.883 --> 01:14:15.146
Your real name?

1700
01:14:16.495 --> 01:14:18.454
James.

1701
01:14:18.628 --> 01:14:21.152
My. uh--
My name is James Walsh.

1702
01:14:22.327 --> 01:14:23.284
You're too messed up

1703
01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:24.329
not to be real.

1704
01:14:24.503 --> 01:14:25.722
Right?

1705
01:14:25.896 --> 01:14:27.593
"James Walsh"?
-Oh. you bet I am.

1706
01:14:27.767 --> 01:14:30.074
[Ayla] [laughing]
-Look. I'm gonna fix this. Ok?

1707
01:14:30.248 --> 01:14:33.033
First you need to go to your
dad. tell them that they have

1708
01:14:33.207 --> 01:14:35.862
control of the installation.
They're gonna try and land your

1709
01:14:36.036 --> 01:14:38.430
entire station and it will not
survive reentry. So someone

1710
01:14:38.604 --> 01:14:40.214
needs to give you a lift
out of there.

1711
01:14:40.388 --> 01:14:41.999
Okay.
What are you going to do?

1712
01:14:42.173 --> 01:14:43.783
I'm gonna try and stop them.

1713
01:14:43.957 --> 01:14:45.306
[Ayla] By yourself?!

1714
01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:46.786
Yeah.

1715
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:48.788
That's stupid!

1716
01:14:48.962 --> 01:14:50.790
Yeah.

1717
01:14:50.964 --> 01:14:52.400
[James] Listen. Ayla we have to
stop them. and I don't know

1718
01:14:52.575 --> 01:14:53.576
what else to do.
-Well then we're going to have

1719
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:56.492
to figure out something else.

1720
01:14:56.666 --> 01:14:58.363
No. I'll take care of it. You
get to Wright Station and--

1721
01:14:58.537 --> 01:15:00.278
No.

1722
01:15:00.452 --> 01:15:02.846
My father decided to stop work
on the fusion engine years ago

1723
01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:05.588
because he didn't think that
people were

1724
01:15:05.762 --> 01:15:07.546
worth it.

1725
01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:09.896
And by locking that away.
he has profited off

1726
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:12.682
the needless suffering of
millions for years.

1727
01:15:12.856 --> 01:15:15.206
He tried to erase everything
that I have ever done

1728
01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:18.209
because he was worried
it might cost him his empire.

1729
01:15:21.778 --> 01:15:22.866
Choosing

1730
01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:24.041
to believe in people

1731
01:15:24.215 --> 01:15:27.044
doesn't make me "naive".

1732
01:15:29.916 --> 01:15:32.484
I'm coming down there.

1733
01:15:33.964 --> 01:15:37.097
And you're going to come get me.

1734

1741
01:16:07.954 --> 01:16:10.304
What did they take?
-Why. the weapons. radar devices

1742

and portable jamming equipment.
of course!

1743

Of course.

deposit.

1745
01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:19.531

percent off my commission.

1753
01:16:38.115 --> 01:16:40.596
No thanks. I've got something
special in mind for this.

[Buddha][Scottish] Mmm! Workin'
for ourselves now are we?

1755

Woof.

1756
01:16:44.904 --> 01:16:46.471
What'dya got in stock?

1757
01:16:46.645 --> 01:16:48.604
[Buddha][British] Well we have
an assortment of off-brand

which won't damage anything but
your digestive system.

-I'll pass.

That I'll take.

1765
01:17:01.355 --> 01:17:03.967
[Buddha][Scottish] Okay. we're
sanitizing everything now.

1766
01:17:05.142 --> 01:17:06.926
[Buddha][Demonic] Hey!

1767
01:17:07.100 --> 01:17:09.059
Do you want me to put this on
the People's Army

1768
01:17:09.233 --> 01:17:11.061
credit account?

1769
01:17:11.235 --> 01:17:12.105
Rock on.

1770
01:17:12.279 --> 01:17:14.151
[Buddha][Demonic] Rock on!

1771
01:17:14.325 --> 01:17:15.848
[Buddha][British] Sanitizing
complete!

1772
01:17:16.022 --> 01:17:16.980
[heavy item dispensing]

1773
01:17:17.154 --> 01:17:19.765
[heavy drawer opening]

1774
01:17:20.853 --> 01:17:22.594
[heavy drawer closing]

1775
01:17:24.552 --> 01:17:26.119
Oh. and Buddha?
[Buddha][British] Yes?

1776
01:17:26.293 --> 01:17:27.425
I'm gonna need one other thing.

1777
01:17:27.599 --> 01:17:28.513
[♪] I'm gonna need one other thing.

1778
01:17:28.687 --> 01:17:29.775
[♪]

1779
01:17:33.910 --> 01:17:35.738
[package ripping]

1780
01:17:43.310 --> 01:17:45.182
[leather flourish]

1781
01:17:47.706 --> 01:17:48.620
[labored sigh]

1782
01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:56.889
[James] Can you hear me alright?
[Ayla] Yeah.

1783
01:17:57.063 --> 01:17:59.849
[James] Okay. Now I need you to
look around for a little

1784
01:18:00.023 --> 01:18:02.373
piece of black tech. It's got
wires sticking out of it like

1785
01:18:02.547 --> 01:18:04.157
legs. It looks like an insect.

1786
01:18:04.331 --> 01:18:05.942
Could it get into the hardware?

1787
01:18:06.116 --> 01:18:08.205
[James] No it doesn't like
actually walk around or

1788
01:18:08.379 --> 01:18:10.511
anything. That would be pretty
cool. though.

1789
01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:12.513
It probably got delivered
with a shipment.

1790
01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:14.124
It works wirelessly. so

1791
01:18:14.298 --> 01:18:15.821
it could probably do that
from anywhere.

1792
01:18:15.995 --> 01:18:17.475
[Ayla] Okay. What are you gonna
do?

1793
01:18:17.649 --> 01:18:19.216
I'm headed to the Eastern
Autonomous Zone.

1794
01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:20.652
Achey territory.

1795
01:18:20.826 --> 01:18:22.436
Seems like the most likely place
to drop you.

1796
01:18:22.610 --> 01:18:24.395
[Ayla] It's not with any of the
deliveries.

1797
01:18:24.569 --> 01:18:26.266
Wait a minute!

1798
01:18:30.009 --> 01:18:32.055
I found it!

1799
01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:35.406
James. this has eight legs.

1800
01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:36.799
[James] So?

1801
01:18:36.973 --> 01:18:38.583
So it's not an insect. it's an
arachnid.

1802
01:18:38.757 --> 01:18:40.716
-What are you. twelve?
-What are you. dumb?

1803
01:18:40.890 --> 01:18:42.369
[James][laughing] God I love
you.

1804
01:18:42.543 --> 01:18:44.894
We don't have time for this
right now! What am I supposed

1805
01:18:45.068 --> 01:18:47.461
to do with this thing?!
-Okay. on the top there should

1806
01:18:47.635 --> 01:18:49.463
be some numbered toggles. I need
you to see

1807
01:18:49.637 --> 01:18:51.378
what it's set to and read the
numbers back to me.

1808
01:18:51.552 --> 01:18:53.380
3-4-3-4-4

1809
01:18:53.554 --> 01:18:55.731
[James] Okay. just flip any one
of the switches

1810
01:18:55.905 --> 01:18:58.037
and then read it back to me.
[grunting] [metal clang]

1811
01:18:58.211 --> 01:18:59.343
[Ayla] Ehhh...

1812
01:18:59.517 --> 01:19:01.040
4-4-3-4-4.

1813
01:19:01.214 --> 01:19:01.954
Okay. so...

1814
01:19:02.128 --> 01:19:03.216
What did I do this for?

1815
01:19:03.390 --> 01:19:05.088
[gravel crushing]

1816
01:19:05.262 --> 01:19:07.046
Because now I should be able to
connect to the Spy.dir unit and

1817
01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.874
see the list of all the vital
programs

1818
01:19:09.048 --> 01:19:11.007
the People's Army has control
of.

1819
01:19:11.181 --> 01:19:11.790
[startup chime]

1820
01:19:11.964 --> 01:19:13.357
[typing]

1821
01:19:13.531 --> 01:19:15.054
[failure chime]

1822
01:19:15.228 --> 01:19:17.230
Ah. yeah looks like they've got
control of gravity

1823
01:19:17.404 --> 01:19:18.754
life support. the whole nine
yards.

1824
01:19:18.928 --> 01:19:20.581
[typing]

1825
01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:22.627
And it definitely looks like
they're going to land you

1826
01:19:22.801 --> 01:19:24.063
in the Eastern Autonomous Zone.

1827
01:19:24.237 --> 01:19:25.673
What about the Liferaft?

1828
01:19:25.848 --> 01:19:27.458
-Liferaft?
-My escape pod.

1829
01:19:27.632 --> 01:19:29.677
My dad had it installed in case
of an emergency to

1830
01:19:29.852 --> 01:19:31.070
get me back to Wright Station.

1831
01:19:31.244 --> 01:19:33.986
Is that the big thing in the
kitchen?

1832
01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.293
Would you be able to use the
Spy.dir unit to reprogram the

1833
01:19:36.467 --> 01:19:37.816
Liferaft to get me to Earth?

1834
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:39.600
Theoretically.

1835
01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:41.254
Yeah. I should be able to
program it to follow a beacon

1836
01:19:41.428 --> 01:19:42.952
that I send from my laptop!

1837
01:19:43.126 --> 01:19:45.084
[Ayla] Great! I can follow it to
your location.

1838
01:19:45.258 --> 01:19:46.564
Well. veer off a little.

1839
01:19:46.738 --> 01:19:47.652
[Ayla] Nah. I'll just land right
on you.

1840
01:19:47.826 --> 01:19:48.435
Heh. Do you know how to fly it?

1841
01:19:48.609 --> 01:19:50.307
Yes.

1842
01:19:50.481 --> 01:19:52.439
Do you know how to land it?

1843
01:19:52.613 --> 01:19:54.006
Theoretically.

1844
01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:55.312
"Theoretically"?!

1845
01:19:55.486 --> 01:19:56.661
[Ayla] I 'll figure it out!

1846
01:19:56.835 --> 01:19:58.010
How much time do we have

1847
01:19:58.184 --> 01:19:59.751
before the initial landing
sequence?

1848
01:19:59.925 --> 01:20:01.709
[warning claxon]
[CARON] Oh. um... excuse me

1849
01:20:01.884 --> 01:20:05.148
Miss Wright. but it appears the
emergency landing sequence

1850
01:20:05.322 --> 01:20:06.932
has been engaged!

1851
01:20:07.106 --> 01:20:09.500
Nevermind.

1852
01:20:09.674 --> 01:20:14.505
[large equipment shifting]
[creaking echoes]

1853
01:20:14.679 --> 01:20:17.682
[CARON] Please locate a
secure surface!

1854
01:20:17.856 --> 01:20:19.771
[disorienting warble]

1855
01:20:25.472 --> 01:20:27.387
Shit!

1856
01:20:32.088 --> 01:20:35.526

[liferaft door stops]

1859
01:20:57.374 --> 01:20:59.463
[James] Alright. Ayla. what's
going on up there?!

1860
01:20:59.637 --> 01:21:01.726
[Ayla] L ooks like I am
good to go.

1861
01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:02.988
Whenever you are.

1862
01:21:03.162 --> 01:21:04.903
Alright I think I found a good
spot.

1863
01:21:05.077 --> 01:21:07.819
[James] In a few minutes. I'll
transmit the beacon. It looks

1864
01:21:07.993 --> 01:21:10.953
like they'll try to land you a
few miles away. so we should

1865
01:21:11.127 --> 01:21:14.173
be far enough--
[warning claxon]

1866
01:21:16.262 --> 01:21:18.047
[servos starting up]

1867
01:21:18.221 --> 01:21:20.310
[another warning claxon]

1868
01:21:20.484 --> 01:21:22.007
CARON!

1869
01:21:22.181 --> 01:21:24.488
Close the Liferaft and enable
manual override!

1870
01:21:24.662 --> 01:21:25.663
[error chime]

1871
01:21:25.837 --> 01:21:27.404
[CARON] I'm sorry. Miss Wright

1872
01:21:27.578 --> 01:21:30.015
But I am not authorized to
enable manual override.

1873
01:21:30.189 --> 01:21:32.626
CARON. I don't need you to
authorize anything. That's why

1874
01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:35.368
it's called "manual override".
[James] We have a problem. Looks

1875
01:21:35.542 --> 01:21:38.328
like they changed the landing
trajectory. It looks like they-

1876
01:21:38.502 --> 01:21:40.112
[glitch out] [negative alert]

1877
01:21:40.286 --> 01:21:42.462
CARON. put him back on.

1878
01:21:42.636 --> 01:21:44.551
CARON?

1879
01:21:44.725 --> 01:21:46.336
[glitching alert]
[CARON] Miss Wright

1880
01:21:46.510 --> 01:21:48.120
I have a pre-recorded message
from

1881
01:21:48.294 --> 01:21:49.861
The People's Army.

1882
01:21:50.035 --> 01:21:51.950
Would you like me to play it
now?

1883
01:21:52.124 --> 01:21:52.908
No.

1884
01:21:53.082 --> 01:21:55.171
[CARON] Playing now.

1885
01:21:55.345 --> 01:21:56.912
[Edgar] Hello. Miss Wright.

1886
01:21:57.086 --> 01:21:59.479
My name is Edgar Bane.

1887

Founding member and acting
general of the People's Army.

1888
01:22:03.309 --> 01:22:04.528
As you may have noticed

1889
01:22:04.702 --> 01:22:06.269
we are currently in the
process of

1890
01:22:06.443 --> 01:22:08.401
commandeering your beautiful
apartment.

1891
01:22:08.575 --> 01:22:10.621
Yeah. no. it looks like
they've changed the LZ to

1892
01:22:10.795 --> 01:22:13.667
right here. Must be some kind of
mistake. I need to make sure

1893
01:22:13.841 --> 01:22:16.235
I'm not transmitting my own--
[Ayla] James CARON is cutting

1894
01:22:16.409 --> 01:22:18.803
you off--can't hear--[static]

[Edgar] Your brothers and
sisters on Earth

1901
01:22:31.511 --> 01:22:32.773
are not your enemies.

1902

[pulse rifle firing]

1903
01:22:34.732 --> 01:22:36.299
[Edgar] We want nothing but
the best for you.

1904
01:22:36.473 --> 01:22:38.257
To remove you from that prison.

1905
01:22:38.431 --> 01:22:41.782
We will welcome you with open
arms.

1906
01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:43.175
We. the people

1907
01:22:43.349 --> 01:22:46.048
will illuminate the dark

1908
01:22:46.222 --> 01:22:48.006

Hey. CARON.

1912
01:22:55.013 --> 01:22:56.928
[CARON] Yes. Miss Wright?
[circuits ripping]

1913
01:22:57.102 --> 01:22:59.539
Miss Wright! Please return my
central processing unit!

1914
01:22:59.713 --> 01:23:02.020
I'm afraid that without it I
won't be able to continue

1915
01:23:02.194 --> 01:23:03.543
our lovely friendship--

1916
01:23:03.717 --> 01:23:05.067

[James][static] --me try this
again! Ayla!

1919
01:23:08.287 --> 01:23:09.680
Can you hear me?!
-Yeah. James!

1920
01:23:09.854 --> 01:23:12.161
[James] Oh hey! What's goin' on?
-Oh. nothing.

1921
01:23:12.335 --> 01:23:14.293
[over PA] [gunshots]

1922
01:23:14.467 --> 01:23:16.643
What was that?
-Just reliving our first date.

1923
01:23:16.817 --> 01:23:18.776
Are you still at the apartment.
sweetheart?!

1924
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:21.300
[Ayla] I'm running a little
behind. You know I just had to

1925
01:23:21.474 --> 01:23:23.433
do my makeup.
- I'm sure you look fine darling

1926
01:23:23.607 --> 01:23:25.348
Can we go?!
-Entering the atmosphere

1927
01:23:25.522 --> 01:23:27.654
requires a suitable ensemble.
Now. I'm going to lose you as

1928
01:23:27.828 --> 01:23:29.439
soon as I start the escape
sequence.

1929
01:23:29.613 --> 01:23:31.223
[James] [falling painfully]
-James?!

1930
01:23:31.397 --> 01:23:33.834
[James] [struggling] Yeah?

1931
01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:37.099
I'm gonna be down there in just
a couple minutes.

1932
01:23:37.273 --> 01:23:38.883
[James] Well. it's about time.

1933
01:23:39.057 --> 01:23:41.712
I can't wait to see you.

which until recently was
thought to be an urban myth

01:33:16.721 --> 01:33:18.636

[host] And if you're asking me.
she's painting a target on her

2121
01:33:25.469 --> 01:33:28.124

01:33:34.347 --> 01:33:36.262
Now's the time. sweetheart!

01:33:36.436 --> 01:33:38.917
[anchor 3] And William Wright
is refusing to comment on

2127
01:33:39.091 --> 01:33:40.963
leaked company documents

01:33:43.705 --> 01:33:46.011
is indeed his biological
daughter. The

01:33:46.185 --> 01:33:48.623

Get my shuttle ready.

I need to visit my daughter.
