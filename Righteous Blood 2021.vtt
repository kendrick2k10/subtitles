3
00:01:36.218 --> 00:01:39.656
Please God. don't kill me.

4
00:01:42.593 --> 00:01:44.295
It was just work.

5
00:01:44.328 --> 00:01:45.630
I needed the money.

6
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.766
Well. I guess you've
been paid in lead.

7
00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:52.669
There a warrant for me?

8
00:01:53.903 --> 00:01:55.772
Speak true and I'll
take away your pain.

9
00:02:03.846 --> 00:02:05.248
Tickle much?

10
00:02:23.332 --> 00:02:24.332
Please.

11
00:02:26.168 --> 00:02:27.971
Hey.

12
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:29.140
Don't. don't you kill me.

13
00:02:30.072 --> 00:02:31.075
I have a family.

14
00:02:33.243 --> 00:02:36.246
You've been gut shot. You're
in the middle of nowhere.

15
00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:38.816
You don't wanna bleed out here.

16
00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.684
Buzzards. they'll start
picking out your body

17
00:02:40.717 --> 00:02:41.819
before you finish passing.

18
00:02:44.755 --> 00:02:46.023
Please God. No.

19
00:03:08.712 --> 00:03:09.712
Stewart.

20
00:03:10.846 --> 00:03:11.846
Come on out.

21
00:03:31.701 --> 00:03:33.069
Is he dead?

22
00:03:33.102 --> 00:03:34.705
Yeah. he's dead.

23
00:03:43.046 --> 00:03:44.682
$2.000.

24
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.251
You know what this means?

25
00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:53.389
Yeah. More bounty
hunters on our trail.

26
00:03:53.422 --> 00:03:55.358
Lots more men coming to collect.

27
00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.094
More gunfire. more killing.

28
00:03:59.762 --> 00:04:01.898
I don't think I can handle this.

29
00:04:01.932 --> 00:04:05.803
Stewart. if you ain't
got the guts for this life.

30
00:04:05.836 --> 00:04:07.904
then maybe you should
get yourself elsewhere.

31
00:04:14.177 --> 00:04:16.113
I. I thought I could do this.

32
00:04:17.848 --> 00:04:18.848
Be like you.

33
00:04:21.117 --> 00:04:22.117
But I can't.

34
00:04:23.787 --> 00:04:25.156
Take his guns. his belt.

35
00:04:26.922 --> 00:04:28.893
You should get some
good money for 'em.

36
00:04:30.893 --> 00:04:31.994
Really?

37
00:04:32.028 --> 00:04:33.030
Leave the bullets.

38
00:04:46.109 --> 00:04:48.212
I hate to tell you this.

39
00:04:49.812 --> 00:04:53.216
Horses ran off
when the shooting started.

40
00:04:55.018 --> 00:04:56.387
That horse I was riding?

41
00:04:59.122 --> 00:05:00.256
Yeah. that one too.

42
00:05:03.093 --> 00:05:04.093
They got spooked.

43
00:05:08.532 --> 00:05:11.435
No horse. no money.
and a bounty on my trail.

44
00:05:13.937 --> 00:05:15.239
Smart you walk away. kid.

45
00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:18.139
Go on.

46
00:05:20.876 --> 00:05:23.446
You're gonna need
money to get out of town.

47
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:24.982
Maybe get a train ticket.

48
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:28.986
You gonna take that job
I done told you about?

49
00:05:29.018 --> 00:05:33.290
Now that I ain't got no
horse. I don't have no choice.

50
00:05:33.323 --> 00:05:34.525
What do you mean?

51
00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.893
This wouldn't be the
first. second. or 10th time

52
00:05:36.927 --> 00:05:38.496
you killed for money.

53
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:41.531
No. it ain't. kid.

54
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.240
It's been a real
honor knowing you.

55
00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:55.045
Sorry I can't ride
with you no more.

56
00:07:39.049 --> 00:07:40.049
I have no money.

57
00:07:40.716 --> 00:07:42.018
You carrying a shootin' iron?

58
00:07:42.052 --> 00:07:43.420
None.

59
00:07:43.453 --> 00:07:46.189
In fact. I have nothing that
would tempt a highway man.

60
00:07:46.222 --> 00:07:48.058
Where's the pity?

61
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:49.167
I've been called
a lot of things.

62
00:07:49.191 --> 00:07:51.061
but a thief ain't one of 'em.

63
00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:56.266
Oh I see. you're a wanted man.

64
00:07:56.299 --> 00:07:57.434
May I ask for what?

65
00:07:58.567 --> 00:08:01.537
Nothin' you want a part of.

66
00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:04.574
If you'd consider putting
that gun down for a moment.

67
00:08:04.607 --> 00:08:06.510
perhaps we could converse.

68
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:09.211
You alone?

69
00:08:10.379 --> 00:08:12.548
I never answer at gunpoint.

70
00:08:23.059 --> 00:08:24.528
I'm alone.

71
00:08:24.561 --> 00:08:27.698
I just come here to get water
from the creek every morning.

72
00:08:27.730 --> 00:08:29.632
Church is uh. nearby.

73
00:08:29.665 --> 00:08:31.343
Would you like to come
with me and talk there?

74
00:08:31.367 --> 00:08:33.436
You got horses at your church?

75
00:08:33.469 --> 00:08:35.372
I'd be riding if we did.

76
00:08:35.405 --> 00:08:37.240
Would you like to
come up and see?

77
00:08:37.272 --> 00:08:39.976
Man on the run ain't got
time for a friendly stroll.

78
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.745
That poster reads
that you're wanted

79
00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:44.682
for multiple counts of murder.

80
00:08:46.216 --> 00:08:47.250
Well.

81
00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:51.287
Ain't you got sharp eyes. padre.

82
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.755
My ears work as well.

83
00:08:52.789 --> 00:08:53.789
You hear it?

84
00:08:58.093 --> 00:09:01.364
A wanted man I think
should hide out of sight.

85
00:09:01.397 --> 00:09:04.133
If you promise to
refrain from violence.

86
00:09:04.166 --> 00:09:06.569
I promise to send
them on their way.

87
00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:32.695
Good day to you. father.

88
00:09:32.728 --> 00:09:34.464
Good day.

89
00:09:35.564 --> 00:09:37.266
Have you seen this man?

90
00:09:40.804 --> 00:09:43.040
I'm afraid I can't help you.

91
00:09:43.073 --> 00:09:44.073
Well.

92
00:09:45.275 --> 00:09:46.275
Thank you. father.

93
00:09:47.276 --> 00:09:48.478
You keep a watch. now.

94
00:09:50.146 --> 00:09:52.549
Can I give you a ride into
town or up to the church?

95
00:09:52.582 --> 00:09:55.318
I'm right where the
good Lord needs me to be.

96
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:56.253
Thank you.

97
00:09:56.285 --> 00:09:58.255
Well thank you. father.

98
00:10:25.615 --> 00:10:26.615
Padre.

99
00:10:28.117 --> 00:10:29.819
you could've made
yourself a rich man.

100
00:10:31.487 --> 00:10:33.689
Dollars don't interest
me. but your soul does.

101
00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:37.494
Well. you allowed
me another sunrise.

102
00:10:37.526 --> 00:10:39.496
and for that I'm grateful.

103
00:10:39.529 --> 00:10:41.431
It's good you know what
it is to be grateful.

104
00:10:41.463 --> 00:10:43.467
means there's hope for you.

105
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:47.504
Hope? Hope's like time. it
ain't never been on my side.

106
00:10:48.872 --> 00:10:50.774
I think we met for a reason.

107
00:10:50.806 --> 00:10:53.442
Padre. trust me. your Lord.

108
00:10:53.476 --> 00:10:55.645
he ain't got no use
for a man like me.

109
00:10:55.678 --> 00:10:58.381
You may have turned
your back on the Lord.

110
00:10:58.414 --> 00:11:00.818
but the Lord has not
turned his back on you.

111
00:11:01.885 --> 00:11:02.885
I can show you.

112
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:07.457
Padre. you could wash me
in the blood of the savior.

113
00:11:07.490 --> 00:11:10.360
but it ain't gonna wash
the blood from these hands.

114
00:11:10.392 --> 00:11:12.137
That you call him savior
means that your faith

115
00:11:12.161 --> 00:11:13.729
hasn't deserted you.

116
00:11:13.762 --> 00:11:16.867
A moment ago. I held
your life in my hands.

117
00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.337
That you're still standing
at this moment is his doing.

118
00:11:22.704 --> 00:11:23.704
Wouldn't you agree?

119
00:11:24.774 --> 00:11:27.477
I give you back to God. my son.

120
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.148
Go. from this hour no
longer an agent of evil.

121
00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:33.415
The devil no longer your guide.

122
00:12:01.777 --> 00:12:02.777
Mrs. Boswell.

123
00:12:07.650 --> 00:12:08.651
Who are you?

124
00:12:08.684 --> 00:12:10.286
I'm a gun for hire. ma'am.

125
00:12:13.488 --> 00:12:15.492
I heard you got a call
for a fellow like me.

126
00:12:20.229 --> 00:12:22.298
I didn't think
anyone would come.

127
00:12:35.811 --> 00:12:37.413
You sure you wanna do this?

128
00:12:38.548 --> 00:12:39.883
You think I'm a monster?

129
00:12:39.915 --> 00:12:41.550
No. ma'am I've seen monsters.

130
00:12:41.583 --> 00:12:43.487
I just want to be sure
that you're certain

131
00:12:44.886 --> 00:12:48.491
that you wanna go through
with this. to the end.

132
00:12:53.563 --> 00:12:55.631
He was wrapped in
this when he was born.

133
00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.436
We had hoped the
doctors were wrong but.

134
00:13:01.703 --> 00:13:03.439
as he grew. he never spoke.

135
00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:06.475
Never called me mama.

136
00:13:08.578 --> 00:13:09.746
He never smiled at me.

137
00:13:12.649 --> 00:13:14.451
My son was born wrong. you see.

138
00:13:15.584 --> 00:13:16.584
Feeble-minded.

139
00:13:19.488 --> 00:13:21.458
There was nothing
the doctors could do.

140
00:13:23.593 --> 00:13:25.996
They said I waited too
long to have a baby.

141
00:13:26.029 --> 00:13:29.466
and this was a common
occurrence among older mothers.

142
00:13:30.433 --> 00:13:32.669
I didn't realize it at the time.

143
00:13:32.702 --> 00:13:33.702
Had I known.

144
00:13:36.905 --> 00:13:39.742
Doctor said he wouldn't
live very long but.

145
00:13:41.577 --> 00:13:43.814
each time he's fallen.
I've been there.

146
00:13:45.681 --> 00:13:48.751
He's never dirty or hungry.

147
00:13:51.386 --> 00:13:52.856
And all that should
bring me joy.

148
00:13:54.824 --> 00:13:56.260
But there's only misery.

149
00:14:00.796 --> 00:14:02.266
My husband left.

150
00:14:03.433 --> 00:14:04.635
He couldn't take it anymore.

151
00:14:05.868 --> 00:14:09.439
Said the boy's an abomination.
and it's a sin to raise him.

152
00:14:12.375 --> 00:14:14.044
I don't want this anymore.

153
00:14:16.545 --> 00:14:20.983
I have a dream. to get
back with my husband.

154
00:14:21.016 --> 00:14:26.022
We can adopt a normal. healthy
child and live a happy life.

155
00:14:29.592 --> 00:14:31.928
You see. I'm not a bad person.

156
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:38.334
I can do what you
need done. ma'am.

157
00:14:38.367 --> 00:14:39.367
Thank you. sir.

158
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:46.876
You don't know what
this means to me.

159
00:14:49.578 --> 00:14:53.449
I've wanted to do it myself
but. I just couldn't.

160
00:14:56.752 --> 00:14:58.987
What do I call you. good sir?

161
00:14:59.021 --> 00:15:00.457
What's your name?

162
00:15:00.490 --> 00:15:02.125
My name and what I'm
about to do. ma'am.

163
00:15:02.157 --> 00:15:04.460
are two things
you'd best forget.

164
00:15:05.527 --> 00:15:06.562
He's still my lil.

165
00:15:08.897 --> 00:15:10.633
Please make sure
he doesn't suffer.

166
00:15:12.034 --> 00:15:13.034
I will.

167
00:15:14.904 --> 00:15:16.807
There's a grave
site up the hill.

168
00:15:17.839 --> 00:15:20.075
That's where I buried my father.

169
00:15:20.108 --> 00:15:22.711
I left a shovel for
you. or if you want.

170
00:15:22.745 --> 00:15:23.646
- I can help you...
- No. no.

171
00:15:23.679 --> 00:15:25.048
Ma'am. that won't be necessary.

172
00:15:26.681 --> 00:15:28.517
You'll hear two
shots close together.

173
00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:30.886
then you'll know it's done.

174
00:15:53.608 --> 00:15:54.944
Come on. boy.

175
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.717
Darlin'.

176
00:17:08.751 --> 00:17:10.587
- Hey.
- How I've missed you so.

177
00:17:10.619 --> 00:17:13.956
Our bed has been cold
without you. lonely.

178
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:16.826
But. now that you're back.
all shall be as it was.

179
00:17:16.858 --> 00:17:19.261
Let me still my prattling.

180
00:17:19.294 --> 00:17:20.734
Were you able to
bring the cattle in?

181
00:17:20.762 --> 00:17:22.698
Did you make the
money you'd hoped for?

182
00:17:27.869 --> 00:17:29.738
You're so thin.

183
00:17:29.771 --> 00:17:33.242
Well. food's been
a little scarce.

184
00:17:34.809 --> 00:17:36.121
Fox took all our chickens.
and the. the crops.

185
00:17:36.145 --> 00:17:38.815
they were spoiled by
flooding a few months ago.

186
00:17:38.848 --> 00:17:40.617
But. now that you're back...

187
00:17:42.784 --> 00:17:44.553
But. but you said uh. when...

188
00:17:44.587 --> 00:17:45.288
What?

189
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.522
When I left last season...

190
00:17:46.556 --> 00:17:47.257
Yeah?

191
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:49.925
You said that uh. well.

192
00:17:49.959 --> 00:17:51.728
you. you thought
you were pregnant.

193
00:17:52.895 --> 00:17:54.864
And I've been gone
from months now.

194
00:17:54.896 --> 00:17:57.800
I thought you'd be uh. you know.

195
00:17:59.935 --> 00:18:00.935
rounder.

196
00:18:02.771 --> 00:18:04.540
I regret.

197
00:18:05.942 --> 00:18:09.178
I. I was mistaken.

198
00:18:15.917 --> 00:18:18.621
So you're not with child?

199
00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:24.661
I'm not. But. we can try
again now that you're back.

200
00:18:24.694 --> 00:18:27.297
We've been married
for years. Charlotte.

201
00:18:27.329 --> 00:18:29.566
and I'm still without a son.

202
00:18:29.598 --> 00:18:33.836
But in your frustration.
my love. remember.

203
00:18:33.868 --> 00:18:35.638
making the baby is the fun part.

204
00:18:36.806 --> 00:18:39.107
Where'd you learn
to talk so dirty?

205
00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:43.612
All I'm saying is. do
not give in to despair.

206
00:18:43.646 --> 00:18:45.781
We can start fresh.

207
00:18:48.084 --> 00:18:52.689
I love you Charlotte.
but I want a family.

208
00:18:53.588 --> 00:18:54.699
And I told you how
important that was to me

209
00:18:54.723 --> 00:18:56.125
when we first got married.

210
00:18:56.157 --> 00:18:58.962
And it is a gift I wish to
give you in abundance. my love.

211
00:19:00.396 --> 00:19:02.598
Yeah. you've been saying
that year in. year out.

212
00:19:02.632 --> 00:19:04.734
But every damn year
it's the same problem.

213
00:19:07.002 --> 00:19:08.905
What are you.
what are you saying?

214
00:19:11.741 --> 00:19:12.943
I made preparations.

215
00:19:14.409 --> 00:19:16.812
In case I came back to
find you not with child.

216
00:19:19.982 --> 00:19:21.617
I went to the courthouse
on my way home.

217
00:19:24.953 --> 00:19:27.690
Somehow. I just knew you
wasn't gonna be pregnant.

218
00:19:27.723 --> 00:19:29.992
You need to make your
mark on these here papers.

219
00:19:30.026 --> 00:19:32.362
That'll be the divorce.
done and legal.

220
00:19:36.365 --> 00:19:37.733
You love me.

221
00:19:37.767 --> 00:19:38.977
How can you give
up on me like this?

222
00:19:39.001 --> 00:19:41.605
I do love you. but
I need a whole woman.

223
00:19:43.938 --> 00:19:45.340
All right?

224
00:19:45.374 --> 00:19:46.876
One that can bear me children.

225
00:19:50.178 --> 00:19:52.047
You just can't do that.

226
00:19:53.281 --> 00:19:54.384
A whole woman?

227
00:19:55.951 --> 00:19:58.254
One that's fertile.

228
00:20:02.692 --> 00:20:05.694
Is there? Is there someone else?

229
00:20:09.698 --> 00:20:10.698
Who is she?

230
00:20:11.399 --> 00:20:12.434
It's nothin' like that.

231
00:20:12.467 --> 00:20:13.902
Tell me.

232
00:20:23.011 --> 00:20:24.012
Who is she?

233
00:20:31.921 --> 00:20:33.023
It's Mary Sue Olson.

234
00:20:35.424 --> 00:20:37.661
The girl who works
at the mercantile?

235
00:20:39.462 --> 00:20:41.431
Don't make this any
harder than it already is.

236
00:20:41.463 --> 00:20:42.463
All right?

237
00:20:43.398 --> 00:20:45.233
Just go on and
make your mark now.

238
00:20:50.004 --> 00:20:52.175
I'm gonna need my
grandmama's ring back.

239
00:20:52.207 --> 00:20:54.843
No. Bo. You are
not doing this to me.

240
00:20:54.876 --> 00:20:57.879
You can't just take all of a
person's heart and cast it off

241
00:20:59.013 --> 00:21:00.716
when and where it pleases you.

242
00:21:04.419 --> 00:21:05.921
Farewell. Charlotte.

243
00:21:09.959 --> 00:21:12.161
I'll give you back
your father's name.

244
00:24:57.386 --> 00:24:59.088
Come on kid.
let's get outta here

245
00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.489
before your mother
realizes what happened.

246
00:25:01.522 --> 00:25:02.522
Come on now.

247
00:26:00.515 --> 00:26:02.084
Something bothering you. boy?

248
00:26:05.087 --> 00:26:06.388
What's the matter?

249
00:26:10.392 --> 00:26:11.728
You're hungry. huh?

250
00:26:14.296 --> 00:26:15.296
Well.

251
00:26:19.068 --> 00:26:20.569
Show you what I've got.

252
00:26:27.142 --> 00:26:28.244
This is all I got.

253
00:26:33.682 --> 00:26:36.319
Try it. It's good.

254
00:26:42.390 --> 00:26:45.527
Mm-hmm. That's good. isn't it?

255
00:26:50.299 --> 00:26:52.100
You wanna tell me your name now?

256
00:26:56.204 --> 00:26:57.204
Okay.

257
00:27:01.476 --> 00:27:02.476
I'm Jericho.

258
00:27:07.482 --> 00:27:08.482
Feeling better?

259
00:27:12.788 --> 00:27:14.490
We got a ways to go. boy.

260
00:27:41.349 --> 00:27:43.319
So what should I call you?

261
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:04.372
You don't gotta
tell me if you don't want to.

262
00:28:11.713 --> 00:28:12.713
I'm Jericho.

263
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:15.950
Can you say that?

264
00:28:21.455 --> 00:28:25.328
Why don't you play that.
that song of yours.

265
00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:31.200
That one you played
this morning.

266
00:28:51.353 --> 00:28:52.353
Yeah.

267
00:28:53.754 --> 00:28:55.390
That's kinda sweet.

268
00:28:59.994 --> 00:29:02.598
It's all comforting. It's sweet.

269
00:30:26.815 --> 00:30:27.815
We meet again.

270
00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:31.386
The Lord works in
mysterious ways.

271
00:30:31.419 --> 00:30:34.789
Padre. I was. I was
hoping I'd run into you.

272
00:30:36.357 --> 00:30:37.592
That's why I'm here.

273
00:30:37.626 --> 00:30:39.862
I'm here where the
good Lord wants me to be.

274
00:30:39.895 --> 00:30:42.498
I begin and end my
life in his service.

275
00:30:43.665 --> 00:30:44.665
Service?

276
00:30:46.335 --> 00:30:49.338
Yes. we must live to
serve someone or something.

277
00:30:49.370 --> 00:30:50.538
Who do you serve?

278
00:30:50.571 --> 00:30:53.608
Well. I served many
a horror in my day.

279
00:30:53.642 --> 00:30:56.679
but that's not a conversation
I'd wanna have with a priest.

280
00:30:57.779 --> 00:30:59.548
Service. Jericho?

281
00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:02.550
What you just described is a
carnal pleasure. not service.

282
00:31:04.618 --> 00:31:05.618
Who's your partner?

283
00:31:08.357 --> 00:31:10.292
That's a poor.
feeble-minded boy.

284
00:31:11.393 --> 00:31:12.828
Feeble-minded?

285
00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.530
His mind's broke somehow.

286
00:31:15.563 --> 00:31:17.732
Maybe he was just born wrong.

287
00:31:17.765 --> 00:31:20.868
There's nothing wrong
with any of God's children.

288
00:31:20.902 --> 00:31:23.606
Sleeping there. he looks
like a little angel.

289
00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:27.710
He might. I don't know
what an angel looks like.

290
00:31:29.077 --> 00:31:31.780
I do. I can see it from here.

291
00:31:31.812 --> 00:31:32.812
His pure heart.

292
00:31:33.982 --> 00:31:35.917
Children like this.
born that way.

293
00:31:35.951 --> 00:31:39.521
have a unique ability of
bringing out the best in people.

294
00:31:39.553 --> 00:31:40.955
How so?

295
00:31:40.989 --> 00:31:43.893
They require extra patience.
understanding. compassion.

296
00:31:45.527 --> 00:31:48.564
They can be the cure for the
selfishness in people's hearts.

297
00:31:49.897 --> 00:31:51.934
Anyone who would live in
service to a child of God.

298
00:31:51.966 --> 00:31:53.569
would live by the grace of God.

299
00:31:55.103 --> 00:31:57.807
That boy's mama wanted me
to put him in a cold grave.

300
00:32:02.610 --> 00:32:03.987
You know. I killed a
lot of men in my day.

301
00:32:04.011 --> 00:32:06.048
and I'm sure I'll see a
lotta of them in hell.

302
00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:10.452
But. when I looked in that
boy's eyes. I couldn't do it.

303
00:32:14.155 --> 00:32:15.857
Now I don't know
what to do with him.

304
00:32:16.925 --> 00:32:18.165
and that's why I'm here. padre.

305
00:32:18.193 --> 00:32:20.863
Mm. an act of compassion.

306
00:32:21.797 --> 00:32:23.464
Not something that
you would find written

307
00:32:23.498 --> 00:32:24.732
on that wanted poster.

308
00:32:24.765 --> 00:32:26.501
Well. it's my first time.

309
00:32:26.534 --> 00:32:29.003
So maybe the newspapers
haven't picked up on it yet.

310
00:32:30.172 --> 00:32:32.674
First act of
compassion is important.

311
00:32:32.706 --> 00:32:34.109
It's a step towards change.

312
00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:37.413
Padre. don't get carried away.

313
00:32:37.445 --> 00:32:39.615
I'm just looking for a
place to stash that boy.

314
00:32:43.819 --> 00:32:45.753
One of my parishioners
could be of help to you.

315
00:33:19.988 --> 00:33:21.957
Good day. ma'am.

316
00:33:24.091 --> 00:33:25.593
I'm uh. just wondering

317
00:33:26.761 --> 00:33:28.664
if you might've seen
this here feller.

318
00:33:29.865 --> 00:33:30.865
He's a wanted criminal.

319
00:33:32.133 --> 00:33:34.670
I have not. Are you the law?

320
00:33:38.507 --> 00:33:40.142
Mind if I take a
look in the house?

321
00:33:43.712 --> 00:33:46.181
I told you I haven't seen him.

322
00:33:46.213 --> 00:33:48.117
You don't question
me in my own home.

323
00:33:52.753 --> 00:33:53.753
You alone?

324
00:33:54.923 --> 00:33:55.923
What?

325
00:33:57.591 --> 00:33:59.461
Well. you sure are pretty.

326
00:34:01.029 --> 00:34:02.731
Not safe for a lady to be alone.

327
00:34:02.763 --> 00:34:04.867
Not with a wanted
killer on the loose.

328
00:34:04.899 --> 00:34:07.802
I haven't seen the
man you're looking for.

329
00:34:07.836 --> 00:34:09.705
And I think it's best if you go.

330
00:34:11.805 --> 00:34:15.477
I don't take kindly
to rudeness. ma'am.

331
00:34:18.178 --> 00:34:19.981
Please. go.

332
00:34:21.249 --> 00:34:22.785
There I was paying
you a compliment.

333
00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:29.290
But there is still
somethin' I want from ya.

334
00:34:29.323 --> 00:34:31.626
There's nothing for you here.

335
00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.662
Please leave. Now.

336
00:34:36.164 --> 00:34:39.834
You know. I've been hunting
this crazed killer for weeks.

337
00:34:40.901 --> 00:34:43.070
I bring criminals to justice.

338
00:34:43.104 --> 00:34:45.774
I make the world a safer place.

339
00:34:45.807 --> 00:34:48.544
I'm kind of a hero of sorts.

340
00:34:48.577 --> 00:34:50.745
And. I like you.

341
00:34:51.812 --> 00:34:53.314
I think you're real pretty.

342
00:34:53.347 --> 00:34:55.050
Oops. said that already.

343
00:34:56.251 --> 00:34:57.752
Guess I'm kinda nervous.

344
00:34:58.953 --> 00:35:00.222
No need to be.

345
00:35:00.254 --> 00:35:02.925
But. I do have
things to tend to so.

346
00:35:02.957 --> 00:35:04.559
it's best if you got goin' now.

347
00:35:06.727 --> 00:35:10.698
I like you. You know.
in a romantic way.

348
00:35:12.734 --> 00:35:14.069
Listen here.

349
00:35:14.102 --> 00:35:16.939
What if I was to make
it worth your while?

350
00:35:16.972 --> 00:35:17.972
What?

351
00:35:19.006 --> 00:35:21.909
Well. you know like
them girls in town.

352
00:35:21.943 --> 00:35:23.778
Them soiled doves at the saloon.

353
00:35:24.979 --> 00:35:26.115
I am no whore.

354
00:35:28.783 --> 00:35:31.620
Well. you sure
do speak like one.

355
00:35:32.988 --> 00:35:33.988
Dirty tongue.

356
00:35:35.156 --> 00:35:37.893
Bet you can do plenty
with that mouth.

357
00:35:37.926 --> 00:35:38.926
Bite.

358
00:35:39.894 --> 00:35:41.796
No need for them teeth. darling.

359
00:35:42.763 --> 00:35:47.102
The gentlemanly tone
you're gettin' is a gift.

360
00:35:47.135 --> 00:35:49.937
I could take you inside. pull
that dress over your head.

361
00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:52.640
and forget all
this fool talking.

362
00:35:54.075 --> 00:35:57.044
But I got me a good
standing with the marshal.

363
00:35:57.077 --> 00:36:00.982
Hence why I'm approaching
you with all this commerce.

364
00:36:02.651 --> 00:36:05.654
I'm offering you money. for
just a little of your time.

365
00:36:06.588 --> 00:36:08.624
You better turn around
and get outta here.

366
00:36:08.656 --> 00:36:09.959
My husband'll be home soon.

367
00:36:11.926 --> 00:36:14.063
Husband? You ain't
got no husband. do you?

368
00:36:15.696 --> 00:36:18.334
I do too. And he's
due back any moment now.

369
00:36:22.403 --> 00:36:24.839
Then where's your
wedding ring. married lady?

370
00:36:27.042 --> 00:36:28.844
I'll be your husband now.

371
00:36:32.379 --> 00:36:34.849
And tonight will
be our honeymoon.

372
00:36:36.051 --> 00:36:37.819
You dare touch
me. you'll be sorry.

373
00:36:38.919 --> 00:36:41.122
Mark my words.

374
00:36:42.923 --> 00:36:47.295
Damn. You are a 4th of
July firecracker. ain't ya?

375
00:36:48.497 --> 00:36:52.000
Well. if ya ain't keen on giving
me some of that good loving

376
00:36:52.033 --> 00:36:54.368
at least you can offer me
to touch them fine bosoms

377
00:36:54.401 --> 00:36:56.070
you're hiding there.

378
00:36:56.104 --> 00:36:57.306
I'll pay you cash.

379
00:36:58.906 --> 00:37:01.977
Make it. make opening
that blouse easier on ya.

380
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:05.981
Yeah. I. I. I just wanna
see 'em and touch 'em.

381
00:37:06.013 --> 00:37:08.082
I won't touch nothing else.

382
00:37:08.115 --> 00:37:11.419
See? I'm being fair.
being reasonable.

383
00:37:13.254 --> 00:37:16.725
I'm startin' to understand.

384
00:37:16.758 --> 00:37:17.959
Forgive me.

385
00:37:17.992 --> 00:37:20.227
I can see that you're
trying to be reasonable.

386
00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:23.698
And. my body is
indeed beautiful.

387
00:37:25.265 --> 00:37:27.903
The desire in you
shouldn't be denied.

388
00:37:27.935 --> 00:37:29.071
Now you're talking.

389
00:37:29.104 --> 00:37:30.872
It's just that...

390
00:37:30.905 --> 00:37:31.905
What's that?

391
00:37:32.473 --> 00:37:33.473
Your gun.

392
00:37:35.075 --> 00:37:37.244
It would be difficult
to show you my body

393
00:37:37.278 --> 00:37:39.247
with that gun in your hand.

394
00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.015
Guns make me nervous.

395
00:37:46.086 --> 00:37:48.122
I'll be honest with you.

396
00:37:48.156 --> 00:37:52.795
I do need the money. and you
aren't asking for too much.

397
00:37:54.095 --> 00:37:56.031
You're also right.

398
00:37:56.064 --> 00:37:57.732
I am alone.

399
00:37:57.765 --> 00:38:00.167
Secretly. I tell you. sir.

400
00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:04.839
how I yearn for the touch
of a strong man like you.

401
00:38:05.874 --> 00:38:09.144
If you would be kind enough
to remove your gun altogether.

402
00:38:09.176 --> 00:38:13.749
I may be moved to
allow you to kiss them.

403
00:38:16.885 --> 00:38:17.885
Kiss. you say?

404
00:38:19.354 --> 00:38:21.356
As your pleasure commands.

405
00:38:22.524 --> 00:38:24.727
After all. they're very sweet.

406
00:38:29.531 --> 00:38:33.969
Such a gift is your
kindness and understanding.

407
00:38:35.068 --> 00:38:37.037
You should be rewarded.

408
00:38:40.975 --> 00:38:43.944
I gave you the opportunity
to leave in peace.

409
00:38:43.977 --> 00:38:46.046
but you chose to stay and die.

410
00:38:54.122 --> 00:38:57.125
My pecker's more
fearsome than that. sister.

411
00:38:58.091 --> 00:39:00.328
Oh. bitch. you done shot me.

412
00:39:01.930 --> 00:39:04.132
Oh. it didn't even go through.

413
00:39:04.164 --> 00:39:06.033
Damn. I think you cracked a rib.

414
00:39:47.941 --> 00:39:49.043
You wait right here.

415
00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.357
What is the problem with
you women folk now-a-days?

416
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:04.059
Goddammit.

417
00:40:04.091 --> 00:40:06.294
Yeah. here I am talking
to you all romantic-like.

418
00:40:08.229 --> 00:40:10.531
And gentlemanly. and...

419
00:40:11.932 --> 00:40:13.167
There. dammit.

420
00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.935
- The choice is yours. sugar.
- No!

421
00:40:14.968 --> 00:40:19.073
Yeah. you can live. and
let me do my business.

422
00:40:19.106 --> 00:40:21.208
Or. I can just shoot
you in the head.

423
00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:24.946
Then I'll have my way
with your pretty self.

424
00:40:24.979 --> 00:40:26.615
You'll be warm just
long enough for me

425
00:40:26.647 --> 00:40:28.182
to do what needs doing.

426
00:40:29.249 --> 00:40:32.152
Trust me. I got me experience.

427
00:40:36.691 --> 00:40:38.359
Ain't you that son of a whore.

428
00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.097
tried to shoot me in
the back week's past?

429
00:40:42.964 --> 00:40:45.901
Now. Jericho. thems
was just warning shots.

430
00:40:48.568 --> 00:40:51.005
I wasn't trying to
hit you or anything.

431
00:40:51.039 --> 00:40:55.542
You hit my horse. That
horse and I came a long way.

432
00:40:55.575 --> 00:40:57.278
I oughta kill you just for that.

433
00:40:58.946 --> 00:41:02.117
Well. you stole my horse
after that little exchange.

434
00:41:02.149 --> 00:41:04.452
I guess that makes us even.

435
00:41:04.484 --> 00:41:06.655
Your horse ran off yesterday.

436
00:41:06.687 --> 00:41:08.390
That horse wasn't worth a shit.

437
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:13.260
Yeah? Well. maybe
that serves you right.

438
00:41:13.294 --> 00:41:16.698
Also. I got a question for ya.

439
00:41:16.731 --> 00:41:19.066
Is that how you
killed all those men?

440
00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.136
Sneaking up on 'em from behind?

441
00:41:21.169 --> 00:41:23.203
You afraid to draw on a man?

442
00:41:23.236 --> 00:41:25.205
Look a man in his eye?

443
00:41:25.238 --> 00:41:27.141
You want me to
give you a show down?

444
00:41:28.176 --> 00:41:29.344
Release that girl.

445
00:41:30.377 --> 00:41:31.377
Why?

446
00:41:32.647 --> 00:41:35.216
'Cause If you don't. I'll
drop you where you stand.

447
00:41:48.763 --> 00:41:49.763
Ma'am.

448
00:41:53.633 --> 00:41:55.937
I left a young boy
at your front door.

449
00:41:58.406 --> 00:42:00.242
Now. if this is my hour.

450
00:42:01.209 --> 00:42:03.211
I want your word that
you'll raise him up

451
00:42:03.243 --> 00:42:04.512
till he can stand on his own.

452
00:42:08.182 --> 00:42:11.986
You have my word. But.
I ask one thing of you.

453
00:42:13.254 --> 00:42:14.389
Kill this bastard good.

454
00:42:17.091 --> 00:42:18.193
Shoot him in the balls.

455
00:42:20.294 --> 00:42:22.196
I like a girl
with a dirty mouth.

456
00:42:23.363 --> 00:42:25.566
Rest assured ma'am.

457
00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:28.069
Looking to make this
a fair fight. Jericho.

458
00:42:29.269 --> 00:42:31.138
I'm just waiting
for her to clear.

459
00:42:50.425 --> 00:42:52.260
That's for my horse.

460
00:42:56.296 --> 00:42:57.664
And this is for the girl.

461
00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:16.383
You say that the
priest sent you?

462
00:43:16.417 --> 00:43:18.386
Yes ma'am. he did.

463
00:43:18.419 --> 00:43:21.256
Divine intervention.
My thanks to you.

464
00:43:23.390 --> 00:43:27.461
Uh. by any chance you have
uh. any food for the boy here?

465
00:43:27.495 --> 00:43:29.064
Is he your son?

466
00:43:29.097 --> 00:43:30.799
No. just uh. I was
taking care of him

467
00:43:30.832 --> 00:43:32.767
until I could find him a place.

468
00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.301
I see.

469
00:43:34.334 --> 00:43:36.403
Well. I don't have much food.

470
00:43:36.437 --> 00:43:38.607
but what's here.
you're welcome to it.

471
00:43:40.207 --> 00:43:41.417
I tell you what. why
don't you fix up somethin'

472
00:43:41.441 --> 00:43:43.610
for you and the boy.
and I'll head out

473
00:43:43.644 --> 00:43:46.814
and see if I can't shoot a
couple of varmints for the table.

474
00:43:46.847 --> 00:43:49.183
That's very kind of you.

475
00:43:49.216 --> 00:43:53.521
In exchange. I insist
you stay for the night.

476
00:43:57.691 --> 00:44:00.427
If you have a spare
blanket. I'll camp out front.

477
00:44:00.461 --> 00:44:03.131
and the boy will
stay here with you.

478
00:44:03.164 --> 00:44:04.164
Agreed.

479
00:45:27.347 --> 00:45:28.415
It's Jericho.

480
00:45:33.453 --> 00:45:35.589
You ever fix something with fox?

481
00:45:35.622 --> 00:45:37.258
Fox?

482
00:45:37.290 --> 00:45:41.428
Oh. I bet he's the one that's
been killing my chickens.

483
00:45:41.461 --> 00:45:43.197
Thank you.

484
00:45:43.231 --> 00:45:45.767
Well. I'm glad to be of service.

485
00:45:49.403 --> 00:45:50.738
Service?

486
00:45:50.771 --> 00:45:53.575
You've been that
and more. Bless you.

487
00:45:54.441 --> 00:45:56.410
Save your blessings
for that boy.

488
00:45:57.611 --> 00:46:01.415
Slumbering there. is he?

489
00:46:01.448 --> 00:46:04.418
He is. A full
belly'll do that to you.

490
00:46:05.519 --> 00:46:06.519
Yes. it will.

491
00:46:09.557 --> 00:46:11.759
You're the first
killer I ever heard of

492
00:46:11.792 --> 00:46:13.194
caring for a child.

493
00:46:14.394 --> 00:46:15.394
Pardon me?

494
00:46:16.296 --> 00:46:19.367
That miserable wretch of
a bounty hunter you shot?

495
00:46:19.399 --> 00:46:21.301
He was looking for you.

496
00:46:21.334 --> 00:46:24.304
Said you were a killer.

497
00:46:24.338 --> 00:46:25.707
Showed me your wanted poster.

498
00:46:27.607 --> 00:46:32.247
But I see you now. caring
for this innocent child.

499
00:46:38.419 --> 00:46:42.390
Why is the law after
you? If I may ask.

500
00:46:44.691 --> 00:46:48.662
Well ma'am. after the war.

501
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:52.567
some men hired me
to clear the way

502
00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.336
for them to lay their railroad.

503
00:46:55.403 --> 00:46:58.006
Now there's some other men
who wanna hang me for it.

504
00:47:02.376 --> 00:47:04.778
I guess I never really found
my place in this world.

505
00:47:07.448 --> 00:47:11.319
Well. you've allowed
me to keep my virtue.

506
00:47:12.319 --> 00:47:14.888
Impressed me with your
kindness to the child.

507
00:47:16.524 --> 00:47:19.627
You've even apprehended the
fox that ate my chickens.

508
00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:22.763
So far. your presence
in my world is welcome.

509
00:47:24.531 --> 00:47:29.504
This day. you've turned a
once sorry house into a home.

510
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.608
Ma'am...

511
00:47:34.642 --> 00:47:36.377
Please. my name is Charlotte.

512
00:47:40.381 --> 00:47:43.350
Charlotte them
might be the kindest words

513
00:47:43.383 --> 00:47:44.952
that's ever been spoke to me.

514
00:48:12.747 --> 00:48:13.748
There we go.

515
00:48:16.751 --> 00:48:17.752
Thank you.

516
00:48:21.622 --> 00:48:24.125
Oh. he likes to have his
arm rubbed like this.

517
00:48:44.879 --> 00:48:46.581
Ready to tell me your name now?

518
00:48:49.950 --> 00:48:50.950
Come on.

519
00:48:52.118 --> 00:48:53.118
Talk to me.

520
00:48:57.057 --> 00:48:58.057
I'm Jericho.

521
00:49:00.693 --> 00:49:01.693
That's Charlotte.

522
00:49:05.633 --> 00:49:06.768
And your name is?

523
00:49:11.539 --> 00:49:12.774
Come on. boy.

524
00:49:34.028 --> 00:49:35.629
I know he's in there somewhere.

525
00:49:39.466 --> 00:49:42.002
He just can't seem
to tell his tale yet.

526
00:49:42.035 --> 00:49:44.938
One thing he might
need is stability.

527
00:49:46.073 --> 00:49:47.073
A home.

528
00:49:48.075 --> 00:49:49.577
You could leave him here.

529
00:49:49.609 --> 00:49:51.613
Just till you get
clear of your trouble.

530
00:49:56.249 --> 00:50:00.120
Charlotte. I may never
be clear of my troubles.

531
00:50:01.488 --> 00:50:03.757
Then. maybe you should stay too.

532
00:50:05.825 --> 00:50:06.660
Stay?

533
00:50:06.693 --> 00:50:07.693
Permanently.

534
00:50:08.662 --> 00:50:09.797
Forgive me.

535
00:50:09.830 --> 00:50:12.066
My mouth sometimes
gets me into trouble.

536
00:50:12.098 --> 00:50:15.569
But. I feel. I
must speak my mind.

537
00:50:15.602 --> 00:50:19.473
And yes. you should
consider living here.

538
00:50:23.910 --> 00:50:24.711
Like?

539
00:50:24.745 --> 00:50:25.745
Like a family.

540
00:50:31.151 --> 00:50:33.687
What would be my
part in this family?

541
00:50:39.026 --> 00:50:40.026
The husband?

542
00:50:50.638 --> 00:50:54.742
Charlotte. you're a
beautiful young woman.

543
00:50:56.176 --> 00:50:59.981
You're like a. like a
flower in this wilderness.

544
00:51:00.948 --> 00:51:04.786
And you're too smart to
waste your life on a.

545
00:51:05.752 --> 00:51:06.888
on an old dog like me.

546
00:51:08.222 --> 00:51:10.658
I'm no such flower.
as I may appear.

547
00:51:12.091 --> 00:51:13.160
I've got a past.

548
00:51:15.963 --> 00:51:20.834
We all have a past. It's
best to leave it behind us.

549
00:51:22.769 --> 00:51:26.073
My past I'm afraid. follows me.

550
00:51:27.274 --> 00:51:28.274
I'm

551
00:51:30.276 --> 00:51:31.878
barren.

552
00:51:31.912 --> 00:51:33.548
I can't have kids.

553
00:51:35.182 --> 00:51:37.752
Not the kind of prize most
men would want to win.

554
00:51:40.053 --> 00:51:44.658
Only a fool wouldn't
see you for what you are.

555
00:51:45.926 --> 00:51:46.926
And that is?

556
00:51:49.897 --> 00:51:51.065
You're a fine lady.

557
00:51:52.231 --> 00:51:53.567
I'd give my oath on it.

558
00:51:58.205 --> 00:52:01.842
And as far as I can reckon. not
being able to bear children.

559
00:52:01.874 --> 00:52:03.777
well that. that ain't no sin.

560
00:52:18.926 --> 00:52:19.994
It's our mutual friend.

561
00:52:21.095 --> 00:52:22.696
Father Ramirez. come in.

562
00:52:24.365 --> 00:52:25.365
Have a seat.

563
00:52:26.767 --> 00:52:28.602
So that's your name.

564
00:52:28.635 --> 00:52:30.604
Father Elijah Ramirez.

565
00:52:30.638 --> 00:52:31.638
Elijah. huh?

566
00:52:33.339 --> 00:52:34.908
Well that makes sense.

567
00:52:34.941 --> 00:52:36.977
You being a priest and all.

568
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:38.745
How's that?

569
00:52:38.778 --> 00:52:41.715
Well. Elijah's one
of those prophets

570
00:52:41.749 --> 00:52:43.251
from the uh Bible. isn't he?

571
00:52:45.118 --> 00:52:46.821
Revelation. indeed.

572
00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.055
You know your Bible.

573
00:52:49.089 --> 00:52:53.127
Caring for a child. keeping
company with a priest.

574
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:55.930
You're like no killer
I've ever heard of.

575
00:52:55.963 --> 00:52:57.330
But. I'll let you
boys get to it.

576
00:52:57.363 --> 00:52:58.832
I've got things to tend to.

577
00:53:05.071 --> 00:53:07.008
Is your first act of compassion

578
00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:09.776
branching off into
better prospects?

579
00:53:09.810 --> 00:53:12.113
Well how do you mean. padre?

580
00:53:13.714 --> 00:53:16.184
If you live a life in
service to her. to the boy.

581
00:53:17.818 --> 00:53:20.053
you'll no longer be a ship
in sea without a rudder.

582
00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:26.394
You'll have direction. purpose.

583
00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.863
And you'll learn that wickedness

584
00:53:28.896 --> 00:53:30.865
has nothing to
offer in comparison.

585
00:53:32.198 --> 00:53:33.934
Padre. I've got guns
that are chasing me

586
00:53:33.966 --> 00:53:38.204
that will not quit until I'm
dead. dead in their wake.

587
00:53:38.238 --> 00:53:40.774
A difficult situation to be in.

588
00:53:40.807 --> 00:53:43.010
A new life within arms' reach.

589
00:53:43.042 --> 00:53:45.412
while your old life is
biting at your heels.

590
00:53:47.247 --> 00:53:48.883
You want to change. Jericho?

591
00:53:50.417 --> 00:53:52.053
You want to live
a peaceful life?

592
00:53:54.988 --> 00:53:55.988
Answer me.

593
00:53:56.823 --> 00:53:59.426
Only a damn fool would
say no to such a thing.

594
00:54:07.167 --> 00:54:09.904
From now on. repent.

595
00:54:11.037 --> 00:54:12.037
Atone.

596
00:54:14.107 --> 00:54:15.910
Ask forgiveness for
what you've done.

597
00:54:17.745 --> 00:54:18.913
And no more killings.

598
00:54:21.281 --> 00:54:23.985
As man of this house. I
will have to defend them.

599
00:54:25.084 --> 00:54:28.188
Defend. but don't murder.

600
00:54:29.890 --> 00:54:32.859
Thus you must dedicate your
life to providing for the boy.

601
00:54:34.127 --> 00:54:35.863
protecting him before yourself.

602
00:54:39.232 --> 00:54:40.232
That's it?

603
00:54:41.535 --> 00:54:44.305
And church on
Sunday. every Sunday.

604
00:54:45.405 --> 00:54:46.973
And you must accompany
me once a week

605
00:54:47.006 --> 00:54:48.309
with my missionary work.

606
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:54.147
And if you're lucky.
that lovely young woman

607
00:54:55.314 --> 00:54:56.950
will let you be
part of her life.

608
00:54:59.185 --> 00:55:00.187
She needs a husband.

609
00:55:01.921 --> 00:55:03.023
The boy needs a father.

610
00:55:08.127 --> 00:55:09.127
And you need a home.

611
00:55:11.131 --> 00:55:13.334
Okay. padre. How do we do this?

612
00:55:17.470 --> 00:55:19.272
We'll go to town
to see the judge.

613
00:55:20.473 --> 00:55:23.042
And I'll explain to him that
you're gonna dedicate your life

614
00:55:23.075 --> 00:55:25.078
to the family and the church.

615
00:55:25.111 --> 00:55:27.180
And that you'll be
under my supervision.

616
00:55:56.142 --> 00:55:57.343
Wait here.

617
00:55:57.377 --> 00:55:59.013
Best that I talk to
the judge myself.

618
00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:15.160
Jericho?

619
00:56:16.229 --> 00:56:19.833
Well I'll be
goddamned. It is you.

620
00:56:19.867 --> 00:56:22.236
I heard it told you were
shot dead two winters back

621
00:56:22.269 --> 00:56:25.071
by a posse that ambushed you.

622
00:56:25.104 --> 00:56:26.549
They ambushed me all
right. but I buried 'em

623
00:56:26.573 --> 00:56:29.143
and left 'em up
on that mountain.

624
00:56:29.176 --> 00:56:31.345
I hoped against
reason that I might by chance

625
00:56:31.377 --> 00:56:33.146
cross your way.

626
00:56:33.180 --> 00:56:34.548
Why is that?

627
00:56:34.580 --> 00:56:37.285
I got work to suit ya.
Paying cash money. big money.

628
00:56:39.218 --> 00:56:41.187
I got the law on
my heels. Wopat.

629
00:56:41.220 --> 00:56:43.156
Not the law in my territory.

630
00:56:43.189 --> 00:56:46.626
Even if they did know about
you all the way out there.

631
00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:49.129
I'm in good favor
with the sheriff.

632
00:56:49.162 --> 00:56:52.066
Few dollars across his
desk. he'll pay you no mind.

633
00:56:53.332 --> 00:56:54.535
What would I be doing?

634
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:58.906
What else would I need you for?

635
00:56:58.939 --> 00:57:01.508
I need the fastest
damn gun I ever seen.

636
00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:04.178
I got some filthy
savages need killin'.

637
00:57:04.211 --> 00:57:05.913
They don't like
my railroad tracks

638
00:57:05.946 --> 00:57:09.216
running across their sacred
earth. or some such horse shit.

639
00:57:09.249 --> 00:57:12.486
Anyhow. I got an empty room
waiting for you at the brothel.

640
00:57:12.519 --> 00:57:15.890
with plenty of fine. sportin'
women. like Delilah here.

641
00:57:19.660 --> 00:57:24.231
Wopat. you're offering everything
a man could want after.

642
00:57:24.263 --> 00:57:26.099
And whiskey. plenty of whiskey.

643
00:57:26.133 --> 00:57:29.236
So come on. carry your happy
ass up on the train with me

644
00:57:29.269 --> 00:57:30.537
before the damn law sees ya.

645
00:57:34.207 --> 00:57:35.276
Wait. wait.

646
00:57:37.443 --> 00:57:38.443
What's wrong?

647
00:57:41.314 --> 00:57:45.285
Wopat. I can't go
with you this time.

648
00:57:46.486 --> 00:57:48.022
I'm hanging up my guns.

649
00:57:48.988 --> 00:57:50.357
No more killing for me. friend.

650
00:57:53.093 --> 00:57:55.263
I gave my word to
someone to. to...

651
00:57:57.564 --> 00:57:59.600
What? To some woman?

652
00:57:59.633 --> 00:58:01.001
No.

653
00:58:01.033 --> 00:58:02.135
Well then who. goddammit?

654
00:58:05.671 --> 00:58:08.074
God. I found God.

655
00:58:11.243 --> 00:58:15.182
Well. best of luck to ya.

656
00:58:45.044 --> 00:58:46.479
Judge ain't big on redemption?

657
00:58:46.513 --> 00:58:48.115
Sadly. you're correct.

658
00:58:48.147 --> 00:58:50.084
Make haste. He just
wouldn't listen to me.

659
00:58:50.117 --> 00:58:52.086
I told him that you'd
be in my custody.

660
00:58:53.053 --> 00:58:55.556
I got too much blood
on my hands. padre.

661
00:58:55.589 --> 00:58:57.324
Don't fret. I'll prevail.

662
00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:10.536
In the name of
the Lord. hear me.

663
00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:14.341
Let. let. let me...

664
00:59:14.374 --> 00:59:16.174
You ain't taking a
bullet meant for me. padre.

665
00:59:18.678 --> 00:59:19.480
Stay here.

666
00:59:19.513 --> 00:59:22.216
Wait.

667
00:59:22.249 --> 00:59:24.350
Please. all of you. don't shoot.

668
01:00:00.287 --> 01:00:02.356
There's more men behind you.

669
01:00:39.392 --> 01:00:41.227
Wait. please. don't shoot.

670
01:00:41.894 --> 01:00:43.362
Don't shoot.

671
01:00:46.265 --> 01:00:48.635
Don't shoot. Please. come back.

672
01:03:37.303 --> 01:03:40.840
I gave my word. I would
only use my gun in defense.

673
01:03:44.343 --> 01:03:46.780
Now you go your
way. and I'll go.

674
01:03:49.015 --> 01:03:50.484
And we'll walk away in peace.

675
01:04:07.334 --> 01:04:10.569
Hey padre. looks like you
almost met your maker there.

676
01:04:10.602 --> 01:04:11.602
My friend.

677
01:04:12.372 --> 01:04:13.982
Sure you still wanna
wager that life of yours

678
01:04:14.006 --> 01:04:16.510
on seeing this
thing through. huh?

679
01:04:16.542 --> 01:04:17.542
Yes.

680
01:04:19.511 --> 01:04:22.316
All these men died
because of me.

681
01:04:23.850 --> 01:04:27.521
No. They died because they
didn't listen to you. padre.

682
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:32.593
My father. he was a good man.

683
01:04:35.127 --> 01:04:37.631
Sadly. he let despair take him

684
01:04:37.664 --> 01:04:39.466
when hard times
struck our family.

685
01:04:40.667 --> 01:04:42.803
In desperation. he
turned into wickedness.

686
01:04:46.705 --> 01:04:47.673
I would have done
anything to show him

687
01:04:47.707 --> 01:04:49.410
that all was not forsaken.

688
01:04:50.609 --> 01:04:55.015
At the time I. I did know how.

689
01:04:55.048 --> 01:04:56.950
Not until I gave my
life to the Lord.

690
01:04:58.718 --> 01:05:01.488
His words. his mercy.

691
01:05:04.457 --> 01:05:06.560
By the time I was
blessed with this wisdom.

692
01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.362
my father had gone to his grave.

693
01:05:11.597 --> 01:05:12.597
I couldn't save him.

694
01:05:14.133 --> 01:05:16.702
Well padre. you. you saved me

695
01:05:16.736 --> 01:05:18.972
from falling in an early grave.

696
01:05:19.004 --> 01:05:22.376
You see now why you must
keep your promise to me.

697
01:05:22.408 --> 01:05:24.877
Well. I reckon if. if I don't.

698
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:27.647
you'll always be here to
keep me noddin' straight.

699
01:05:29.915 --> 01:05:33.486
I'm afraid not.

700
01:05:33.519 --> 01:05:34.854
Padre. you've been shot.

701
01:05:34.888 --> 01:05:36.490
Promise me that
you'll stay true.

702
01:05:36.522 --> 01:05:37.857
After I get you to the doctor.

703
01:05:37.890 --> 01:05:38.959
No. Jericho.

704
01:05:40.126 --> 01:05:42.629
I'm where the good
Lord wants me to be.

705
01:05:42.662 --> 01:05:46.600
I begin and end my life
in. in his service.

706
01:06:56.935 --> 01:06:57.935
Elijah.

707
01:07:03.743 --> 01:07:05.078
Can I name you Elijah?

708
01:07:09.749 --> 01:07:10.749
I'm Jericho.

709
01:07:12.151 --> 01:07:13.151
You're Elijah.

710
01:07:15.555 --> 01:07:16.555
What's my name?

711
01:07:20.727 --> 01:07:22.062
Papa.

712
01:08:01.901 --> 01:08:03.136
Bo.

713
01:08:03.169 --> 01:08:04.169
Charlotte.

714
01:08:05.271 --> 01:08:06.272
It's been a while.

715
01:08:07.874 --> 01:08:09.809
It's been a few years.

716
01:08:09.841 --> 01:08:13.312
How's your wife? Your family?

717
01:08:13.345 --> 01:08:15.748
Well. it all hasn't
went how I hoped.

718
01:08:17.350 --> 01:08:18.350
Oh.

719
01:08:19.351 --> 01:08:22.055
Yeah. Turns out you and
her have a similar condition.

720
01:08:23.855 --> 01:08:24.855
Condition?

721
01:08:26.092 --> 01:08:28.929
Yep. Can't make no babies.

722
01:08:31.663 --> 01:08:33.766
I'm sorry to hear it.

723
01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:37.169
She was after all
a. a whole woman.

724
01:08:38.971 --> 01:08:39.971
Maybe she still is.

725
01:08:43.743 --> 01:08:44.743
What do you mean?

726
01:08:46.980 --> 01:08:50.551
Turns out I'm pregnant.

727
01:08:54.052 --> 01:08:55.622
With my second.

728
01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:59.126
Oh. here comes my first.

729
01:09:03.262 --> 01:09:07.167
Mama. mama. Papa's been
looking all over for you.

730
01:09:07.199 --> 01:09:08.199
Oh. okay.

731
01:09:14.106 --> 01:09:16.243
Well. congratulations.

732
01:09:19.878 --> 01:09:21.814
Good day to you. Miss Charlotte.

733
01:09:21.847 --> 01:09:23.082
Mrs. Charlotte.

734
01:09:28.387 --> 01:09:30.656
I'll pray for you.

735
01:09:53.145 --> 01:09:54.145
What?

736
01:09:55.181 --> 01:09:57.083
We have so much
wood at the house.

737
01:09:57.115 --> 01:09:59.819
Why are you cutting more?

738
01:09:59.851 --> 01:10:00.851
For the church.

739
01:10:01.854 --> 01:10:04.324
You are so devout.
Are you thirsty?

740
01:10:06.359 --> 01:10:09.863
Darling. I am
thirsty for your kiss.

741
01:10:13.766 --> 01:10:15.068
What?

742
01:10:15.101 --> 01:10:17.270
I'd better get back to the kids.

743
01:10:17.302 --> 01:10:19.205
Do not let your supper spoil.

744
01:10:20.239 --> 01:10:21.908
I will not. ma'am.

745
01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:24.877
And. don't waste
all your strength.

746
01:10:25.878 --> 01:10:27.147
You might need it later.

747
01:10:30.115 --> 01:10:31.417
I love that dirty talk.

748
01:11:04.283 --> 01:11:05.919
Legend in the flesh.

749
01:11:08.221 --> 01:11:10.991
Figured it'd be harder sneaking
up on the likes of you.

750
01:11:12.124 --> 01:11:13.124
No sir.

751
01:11:15.293 --> 01:11:16.293
Who might you be?

752
01:11:17.497 --> 01:11:19.700
Who I am makes no nevermind.

753
01:11:22.334 --> 01:11:24.370
Maybe you shot and
killed my brother.

754
01:11:26.138 --> 01:11:27.239
or my father.

755
01:11:30.776 --> 01:11:31.811
None of that matters.

756
01:11:34.113 --> 01:11:36.415
All that matters is I'm
challenging you to a duel.

757
01:11:38.150 --> 01:11:40.153
Gun against gun.

758
01:11:41.988 --> 01:11:43.289
I see that look in your eye.

759
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:45.792
I had that look too.

760
01:11:47.325 --> 01:11:49.895
Then I changed. I
learned a new way.

761
01:11:51.096 --> 01:11:52.965
A way without killing.
a way of peace.

762
01:11:54.167 --> 01:11:55.435
And I could show you.

763
01:11:55.467 --> 01:11:57.770
I came here to kill ya.
not take no preaching.

764
01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:06.178
Besides. I believe there
ain't nothing changed in ya.

765
01:12:08.847 --> 01:12:10.283
Sounds like you're a liar.

766
01:12:11.984 --> 01:12:13.986
Looking to talk your
way outta this fight.

767
01:12:17.589 --> 01:12:18.589
You're too slow.

768
01:12:20.159 --> 01:12:22.996
But you're lucky. I wasn't
lying about having changed.

769
01:12:26.231 --> 01:12:28.033
What're you doin'?

770
01:12:28.066 --> 01:12:29.301
I'm just keeping a promise.

771
01:12:31.102 --> 01:12:35.908
And all I ask in exchange
is you allow me to explain.

772
01:12:35.941 --> 01:12:36.941
You're crazy.

773
01:12:38.144 --> 01:12:39.546
You're staring at a killer.

774
01:12:39.579 --> 01:12:43.884
If you allow me to
explain how I was helped.

775
01:12:45.184 --> 01:12:46.285
maybe I can help you.

776
01:12:51.223 --> 01:12:52.559
You look thirsty. friend.

777
01:12:56.061 --> 01:12:59.131
Can I offer you
a drink of water?
