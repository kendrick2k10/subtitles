you're betting that the

And if you're wrong.the stock

483
00:20:05.472 --> 00:20:07.473
can go up against youvery
sharply.

484
00:20:07.507 --> 00:20:10.809

thatposition. usually at a

back their position

or something.

501

unsure.

1035
00:45:23.256 --> 00:45:26.392

well.

1042
00:45:42.075 --> 00:45:43.242
it should go from $150

to $10.000. right?There is no
limit.

If it goes to $1.000or $2.000.

1046

that had value.

Now. how in the hellis that

1153
00:51:20.246 --> 00:51:24.149
It's a sculpture. I bought
aLeBron James rookie card

He's createda cult around him.

1164
00:51:46.606 --> 00:51:47.773
a religion around him.

1165
00:51:47.807 --> 00:51:50.542
And people. youcan't speak
sense to them.

1166
00:51:50.577 --> 00:51:51.744
They have their own model.

1167
00:51:51.778 --> 00:51:53.012
even if the modeldoesn't make
any sense.

1168

They're goingto buy Elon stuff.

1169
00:51:56.116 --> 00:51:58.017
The thing withthe GameStop

00:52:03.256 --> 00:52:05.124
this stock's tradingfor very
little.

1173
00:52:05.158 --> 00:52:07.292
There's a lotof short interest.

1174
00:52:07.327 --> 00:52:10.262
We can buy optionsand drive it
up and squeeze

1175
00:52:10.296 --> 00:52:11.964
out the shorts.

1176
00:52:12.065 --> 00:52:15.634
Once it started going.it became
a social phenomenon.

1177
00:52:15.669 --> 00:52:18.103
It became an F-uto the system.

1178
00:52:18.138 --> 00:52:23.242

literallytweeting things like.

It's not the way the
worldworks.

probablysold and made a lot of

thebulk of the people

1190

00:53:12.292 --> 00:53:15.127

that this can goto $1.000 a

1197

This whole thing.

it kind of stayed down. right?

And literally.it was getting

1378
01:00:32.632 --> 01:00:33.899
so caught up in it

1379
01:00:33.933 --> 01:00:37.803
and then getting so stuck
inthat diamond hands mentality.

1380
01:00:37.837 --> 01:00:40.739
like don't sell anything.And
that's really

the beginning of the end.

01:07:52.639 --> 01:07:55.074
I didn't feel likeI gained
$350.000.

1535
01:07:55.075 --> 01:07:58.444
I felt like I lost a million.

REPORTER:No doubt lawmakers are
furious

1550
01:08:58.571 --> 01:09:00.572
and they want to havehearings
about this.

1551
01:09:00.607 --> 01:09:02.374
The problem is goingto most
likely

1552
01:09:02.409 --> 01:09:05.377
be that the systemis designed
terribly.

1553
01:09:05.412 --> 01:09:09.314
The system gets abused.And they
need to make changes.

1554
01:09:09.349 --> 01:09:10.582
- First of all. to me.

1555
01:09:10.617 --> 01:09:12.117
this was a whole dogand pony
show.

1556
01:09:12.152 --> 01:09:15.587
- First. Robinhood
Securitiesput the restrictions
in place

1557
01:09:15.622 --> 01:09:18.323
in an effort to meet
increasedregulatory deposit

1558
01:09:18.358 --> 01:09:20.893
requirements.not to help hedge
funds.

1559
01:09:20.927 --> 01:09:22.394
- You can read body
language.You can see the way

1560
01:09:22.429 --> 01:09:25.230
they're trying to weaselout of
something.

1561
01:09:25.265 --> 01:09:27.132
- I understand that partof the
focus of this hearing

1562
01:09:27.167 --> 01:09:29.034
is the decisionof stock trading
platforms

1563
01:09:29.035 --> 01:09:30.936
to limit tradingGameStop.

1564
01:09:31.037 --> 01:09:32.438
I want to make clearat the
outset

1565
01:09:32.472 --> 01:09:34.840
that Melvin Capitalplayed
absolutely no role

1566
01:09:34.874 --> 01:09:37.142
in those tradingplatform
decisions.

1567
01:09:37.177 --> 01:09:39.078
- They're not being honestand
truthful about this.

1568
01:09:39.112 --> 01:09:41.513
- I want to beperfectly clear.

1569
01:09:41.548 --> 01:09:46.318
Citadel Securities had no
rolein Robinhood's decision

1570
01:09:46.353 --> 01:09:48.153
to limit trading in GameStop.

1571
01:09:48.188 --> 01:09:50.055
- So Citadel is a
realconglomerate.

1572
01:09:50.056 --> 01:09:52.291
They have a hedge fund.They
have a broker.

1573
01:09:52.325 --> 01:09:53.592
And they have a marketmaker.

1574
01:09:53.626 --> 01:09:54.793
- Mr. Griffin.

1575
01:09:54.828 --> 01:09:56.628
why is this not
consideredmanipulating a stock

1576
01:09:56.663 --> 01:09:59.498
whenever you can shortsell to
140%?

1577
01:09:59.532 --> 01:10:00.766
Don't youthink there should be
a limit

1578
01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.302
on something like that?

1579
01:10:03.336 --> 01:10:05.204
KEN GRIFFIN:I'm not sure it's
worth us

1580
01:10:05.238 --> 01:10:07.373
delvinginto legislative
corrections

1581
01:10:07.407 --> 01:10:09.441
for a very unique situation.

1582
01:10:09.476 --> 01:10:12.444
in terms of the extremesize of
the short interest.

1583
01:10:12.479 --> 01:10:15.614
- Why is it that a stockcan be
shorted over 100%?

1584
01:10:15.648 --> 01:10:17.182
I don't even knowhow you're
allowed to do that.

1585
01:10:17.217 --> 01:10:18.384
CONGRESSMAN: Mr. Plotkin.

1586
01:10:18.418 --> 01:10:20.319
you made the commentin your
testimony a minute ago

1587
01:10:20.353 --> 01:10:23.322
that you were not tryingto
manipulate stock.

1588
01:10:23.356 --> 01:10:27.493
Yet if you're shortselling a
stock 140%.

1589
01:10:27.527 --> 01:10:30.462
explain to me why that'snot
manipulating the stock.

1590
01:10:30.497 --> 01:10:31.697
- Any time we short a stock.

1591
01:10:31.731 --> 01:10:34.366
our systems actually force usto
find a borrower.

1592
01:10:34.401 --> 01:10:36.635
So we alwaysshort stocks within

1593
01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:39.238
the context of all the rules.

1594
01:10:39.272 --> 01:10:41.040
- The fundamental reasonwhy
this happened

1595
01:10:41.074 --> 01:10:42.408
isn't because we wanteda
revolution

1596
01:10:42.442 --> 01:10:44.309
against hedge funds.It was

1597
01:10:44.344 --> 01:10:46.912
because there wasan opportunity
out there

1598
01:10:46.946 --> 01:10:50.082
to form a short squeezeon a
stock

1599
01:10:50.116 --> 01:10:51.550
and make some money off of it.

1600
01:10:51.584 --> 01:10:54.520
And until the rules changethat
you cannot short a stock

1601
01:10:54.554 --> 01:10:57.089
above 100% short interest.then
there's no reason why

1602
01:10:57.123 --> 01:10:59.024
there wouldn't beanother one of
these.

1603
01:10:59.059 --> 01:11:02.061
- I just want to getto what
happened

1604
01:11:02.062 --> 01:11:03.696
on that day in January.

1605
01:11:03.730 --> 01:11:06.065
So let's takea step back here.

1606
01:11:06.066 --> 01:11:07.599
That decision you made.

1607
01:11:07.634 --> 01:11:09.568
to restrict the buying

1608
01:11:09.602 --> 01:11:12.771
but not the sellingof GameStop.
was based--

1609
01:11:12.806 --> 01:11:16.342
was it based on pressurefrom
anyone

1610
01:11:16.376 --> 01:11:18.844
on the witness panelhere today?

1611
01:11:18.878 --> 01:11:20.079
VLAD TENEV:Not at all.

1612
01:11:20.113 --> 01:11:24.183
Zero pressure from anyone.It
was a collateral depository

1613
01:11:24.217 --> 01:11:27.086
requirement decision madeby a
Robinhood

1614
01:11:27.087 --> 01:11:28.687
securities president.

1615
01:11:28.722 --> 01:11:30.789
- Rather than sayingthat
Robinhood was nefarious

1616
01:11:30.824 --> 01:11:32.257
or had an evilintention here.

1617
01:11:32.292 --> 01:11:34.093
it was colluding with
somebodyelse.

1618
01:11:34.094 --> 01:11:36.228
they were probably negligentin
their capital

1619
01:11:36.262 --> 01:11:37.496
and risk controls.

1620
01:11:37.530 --> 01:11:40.799
- The decision to
restrictGameStop and other
securities

1621
01:11:40.834 --> 01:11:43.302
was driven purely by depositand
collateral

1622
01:11:43.336 --> 01:11:45.704
requirementsimposed by our
clearinghouses.

1623
01:11:45.739 --> 01:11:46.972
- Well. when it comes to it.

1624
01:11:47.007 --> 01:11:48.374
they just literallyran out of
money.

1625
01:11:48.408 --> 01:11:49.608
[LAUGHS]

1626
01:11:49.642 --> 01:11:51.110
If they knew that up front.you
know.

1627
01:11:51.144 --> 01:11:52.978
be transparent.

1628
01:11:53.013 --> 01:11:54.613
MAN:The irony of this entire
thing

1629
01:11:54.647 --> 01:11:56.815
is that Robinhoodprovided a
platform

1630
01:11:56.850 --> 01:11:58.317
for all these investorsto pour
into

1631
01:11:58.351 --> 01:11:59.551
the market.

1632
01:11:59.586 --> 01:12:02.154
and they added hundredsof
thousands of new accounts.

1633
01:12:02.188 --> 01:12:04.423
People wanted to attackWall
Street.

1634
01:12:04.457 --> 01:12:05.824
and thereality of the situation

1635
01:12:05.859 --> 01:12:09.962
is they broke Robin Hood.

1636
01:12:10.063 --> 01:12:12.564
Mr. Tenev. you took

1637
01:12:12.599 --> 01:12:16.635
from your customers in orderto
minimize the $3 billion

1638
01:12:16.670 --> 01:12:18.771
from being largerthan it
probably

1639
01:12:18.805 --> 01:12:20.606
would have been

1640
01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.477
because you wantedto protect
your position.

1641
01:12:25.512 --> 01:12:27.746
and that is very troubling.

1642
01:12:27.781 --> 01:12:29.448
- They had to sacrificesomebody
in order

1643
01:12:29.482 --> 01:12:30.649
to resolve this.

1644
01:12:30.684 --> 01:12:32.785
and they sacrificed the
peoplethat wanted to diamond

1645
01:12:32.819 --> 01:12:34.586
hands their GameStop.

1646
01:12:34.621 --> 01:12:36.422
And a lot of peoplelost a lot
of money.

1647
01:12:36.456 --> 01:12:37.656
ANDY BARR:So if anyone has a
problem

1648
01:12:37.691 --> 01:12:39.091
with your decisionto halt
trades.

1649
01:12:39.092 --> 01:12:40.993
it's fair to say thattheir
frustration should be

1650
01:12:41.094 --> 01:12:43.829
directed towardfederal
regulation.

1651
01:12:43.863 --> 01:12:45.097
VLAD TENEV:Congressman. you
know.

1652
01:12:45.098 --> 01:12:47.499
I'm not trying to throwanyone
under the bus

1653
01:12:47.534 --> 01:12:49.768
in direct frustrationanywhere.

1654
01:12:49.803 --> 01:12:51.804
All I cansay is Robinhood's
security

1655
01:12:51.838 --> 01:12:55.541
played this by the booksand
played it basically

1656
01:12:55.575 --> 01:12:57.109
the only waythat we could
remain in

1657
01:12:57.143 --> 01:12:59.678
compliancewith our deposit
requirements.

1658
01:12:59.713 --> 01:13:00.879
ANDY BARR:Mr. Tenev. I
appreciate--

1659
01:13:00.914 --> 01:13:02.114
CHRIS GARCIA:Wall Street's got
it

1660
01:13:02.148 --> 01:13:03.849
to where they have every card

1661
01:13:03.883 --> 01:13:06.051
and they knowevery rule of the
game

1662
01:13:06.052 --> 01:13:07.186
to where we're going to

1663
01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:10.856
bend and bend those
ruleswithout breaking them.

1664
01:13:10.890 --> 01:13:13.125
And the problemis what they do.

1665
01:13:13.159 --> 01:13:14.660
us typical little guys will

1666
01:13:14.694 --> 01:13:17.196
never be ableto do that stuff.
right?

1667
01:13:17.230 --> 01:13:18.497
MAXINE WATERS:Mr. Gill.

1668
01:13:18.531 --> 01:13:20.466
you are now recognizedfor five
minutes

1669
01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.801
to presentyour oral testimony.

1670
01:13:22.836 --> 01:13:24.570
CHRIS GARCIA: And then
lookwhat's happening. right?

1671
01:13:24.604 --> 01:13:27.973
You got Roaring Kitty out
herewho's getting called in
front

1672
01:13:28.074 --> 01:13:30.075
of anOversight Committee.

1673
01:13:30.110 --> 01:13:32.644
Hey. you did bad.

1674
01:13:32.679 --> 01:13:35.347
You led a group of peopleto do
this.

1675
01:13:35.382 --> 01:13:37.249
KEITH GILL: Thank
you.Chairwoman Waters.

1676
01:13:37.283 --> 01:13:39.385
members of the Committee.

1677
01:13:39.419 --> 01:13:41.387
I'm happy to discusswith the
committee

1678
01:13:41.421 --> 01:13:43.422
my purchases ofGameStop shares

1679
01:13:43.456 --> 01:13:46.592
and my discussions of theirfair
value on social media.

1680
01:13:46.626 --> 01:13:48.861
I also believe the currentprice
of the shares

1681
01:13:48.895 --> 01:13:52.398
demonstrates that I've
beenright about the company.

1682
01:13:52.432 --> 01:13:55.868
A few things I am not.I'm not a
cat.

1683
01:13:55.902 --> 01:13:58.103
I am notan institutional
investor.

1684
01:13:58.104 --> 01:13:59.538
And I do notprovide
personalized

1685
01:13:59.572 --> 01:14:02.608
investment advice for feesor
commissions.

1686
01:14:02.642 --> 01:14:05.210
The idea that I use socialmedia
to promote GameStop

1687
01:14:05.245 --> 01:14:07.179
stock tounwitting investors

1688
01:14:07.213 --> 01:14:10.249
and influencethe market is
preposterous.

1689
01:14:10.283 --> 01:14:12.217
I'm just an individualwhose
investment in

1690
01:14:12.252 --> 01:14:14.586
GameStop and postson social
media

1691
01:14:14.621 --> 01:14:18.624
were based upon my ownresearch
and analysis.

1692
01:14:18.658 --> 01:14:20.859
I want to say that I
supportretail investors'

1693
01:14:20.894 --> 01:14:23.929
right to invest in whatthey
want when they want

1694
01:14:23.963 --> 01:14:25.130
and to send amessage

1695
01:14:25.165 --> 01:14:27.232
based on how they invest.

1696
01:14:27.267 --> 01:14:28.600
As for what happenedin January.

1697
01:14:28.635 --> 01:14:30.636
others will haveto explain it.

1698
01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:32.071
It's alarminghow little we know

1699
01:14:32.072 --> 01:14:34.606
about the inner workingsof the
market.

1700
01:14:34.641 --> 01:14:38.811
As for me. I like the stock.

1701
01:14:38.845 --> 01:14:41.213
(DISTORTED LOW VOICE)I like the
stock.

1702
01:14:41.247 --> 01:14:42.648
- Keith Gill. the legendthat he
is.

1703
01:14:42.682 --> 01:14:44.083
