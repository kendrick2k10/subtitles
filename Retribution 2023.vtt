3
00:04:02.756 --> 00:04:04.725
- Bit early for you.
isn’t it?
-  Yeah.

4
00:04:04.725 --> 00:04:07.761
I wanted to see
what it felt like to be you.

5
00:04:07.761 --> 00:04:08.597
And?

6
00:04:08.597 --> 00:04:10.830
It’s overrated.

7
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:12.106
You’ll get used to it.

8
00:04:12.106 --> 00:04:14.405
How about I just live
vicariously through you
instead?

9
00:04:14.405 --> 00:04:15.604
- Hmm?

10
00:04:15.604 --> 00:04:20.675
Listen. I need you to give
Karl at STB Capital
a call on your way in.

11
00:04:20.675 --> 00:04:22.281
- Oh. yeah?
- Yeah.

12
00:04:22.281 --> 00:04:24.184
I woke up
to an email from him.

13
00:04:24.184 --> 00:04:26.582
I think he’s got
buyer’s remorse.

14
00:04:26.582 --> 00:04:29.354
He likes the returns.

15
00:04:29.354 --> 00:04:30.388
Yeah. but still.

16
00:04:30.388 --> 00:04:33.325
I think something spooked him.
I need you to do your thing.

17
00:04:33.325 --> 00:04:35.426
I’ll talk to him.
He’ll be fine.

18
00:04:35.426 --> 00:04:38.792
Good. You’re a credit
to capitalism.

19
00:04:38.792 --> 00:04:40.695
Say hello to Heather for me.

20
00:04:40.695 --> 00:04:42.829
Not a good idea.

21
00:04:43.203 --> 00:04:45.304
You’re an asshole.

22
00:05:05.126 --> 00:05:06.292
- Morning.

23
00:05:06.292 --> 00:05:09.559
Anders says hello.
Going somewhere?

24
00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:10.461
I...

25
00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:12.628
I’m meeting Christina
this morning.

26
00:05:12.628 --> 00:05:15.202
- Uh-huh?

27
00:05:20.438 --> 00:05:22.671
After that. I thought
I’d pick up the kids

28
00:05:22.671 --> 00:05:25.641
and maybe move
to the Moon.

29
00:05:25.641 --> 00:05:27.346
Oh.

30
00:05:28.545 --> 00:05:30.184
Matt!

31
00:05:31.185 --> 00:05:34.188
I’m sorry. honey.
It-it’s work.

32
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.223
Right.

33
00:05:36.223 --> 00:05:37.851
- I’m meeting Christina.

34
00:05:37.851 --> 00:05:40.227
You said you’d
take them today.

35
00:05:40.227 --> 00:05:42.856
Oh. God. I really need
to make this call.

36
00:05:42.856 --> 00:05:44.891
I can’t have them
playing in the back.

37
00:05:44.891 --> 00:05:46.398
making noise
while I’m on the call...

38
00:05:46.398 --> 00:05:48.895
- Matt. I need to see her.
- ...with an important client.

39
00:05:48.895 --> 00:05:50.501
Can’t you see her this weekend?

40
00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:51.733
I asked you

41
00:05:51.733 --> 00:05:55.275
to help out just one day.

42
00:05:57.376 --> 00:06:00.874
Okay. okay. Fine.
I’m sorry.

43
00:06:03.844 --> 00:06:06.715
- I’m sorry.
- Mm-mm.

44
00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.821
- Heather...

45
00:06:20.696 --> 00:06:22.533
Congratulations.

46
00:06:22.533 --> 00:06:26.867
-  This actually helps...

47
00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:37.350
- Where’s your brother?
- On his phone.

48
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:40.650
Tell him to come down.
We’re leaving now.

49
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.618
Zach. we’re leaving!

50
00:06:41.618 --> 00:06:45.226
-  So. um.
I think you’ll be...

51
00:06:45.226 --> 00:06:47.327
I was
watching that.

52
00:06:47.327 --> 00:06:50.264
Go and get
your brother. Now.

53
00:06:50.264 --> 00:06:53.465
Ugh! [loudly] Zach!

54
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.409
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

55
00:07:06.412 --> 00:07:07.677
What now?

56
00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:10.911
Nothing. It’s fine.

57
00:07:16.015 --> 00:07:17.654
Hey.

58
00:07:18.952 --> 00:07:22.362
Get them to school
on time. okay?

59
00:07:22.626 --> 00:07:24.958
Yeah... Lov-love you.

60
00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:27.763
-  Hey. we’re leaving.
-  Hey. get out!

61
00:07:27.763 --> 00:07:30.029
- Hey. get out!
- Let me come in!

62
00:07:30.029 --> 00:07:31.470
- Just get out!

63
00:07:31.470 --> 00:07:33.868
- I told you last time...
- Oh. for the love of God.

64
00:07:33.868 --> 00:07:36.277
- Get out! Get out! Get out!
- Zach!

65
00:07:36.277 --> 00:07:38.312
- Hey. get out!
- Zach!

66
00:07:38.312 --> 00:07:39.742
Hey. hey. hey. hey.

67
00:07:39.742 --> 00:07:41.777
Hey. hey. hey!
What’s happening here?

68
00:07:41.777 --> 00:07:44.450
- He slammed the door on me.
- You don’t come in here!

69
00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:46.012
Don’t speak
to your sister like that.

70
00:07:46.012 --> 00:07:47.717
Then don’t let her
in my room. Matt.

71
00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:51.721
- Hey. I am your father.

72
00:07:51.721 --> 00:07:52.656
I’m not Matt.

73
00:07:52.656 --> 00:07:55.560
- Why is she crying?
- ’Cause she knows
you’ll fall for it.

74
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.662
- He’s gonna skip school
with her.
- Shut up. Em!

75
00:07:58.662 --> 00:07:59.960
I don’t have time
for this.

76
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:01.830
Go and get
your things ready.

77
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:03.469
Dad. he broke my finger!

78
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:04.030
Go!

79
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:07.803
- We’ll be down in a sec.

80
00:08:10.476 --> 00:08:11.070
Okay.

81
00:08:11.070 --> 00:08:14.678
If this is gonna be
one of your talks. I don’t
have time for it if it is.

82
00:08:14.678 --> 00:08:16.680
Zach. what is this?

83
00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.715
Can I just go now. Dad?

84
00:08:18.715 --> 00:08:21.982
- You’re skipping school?
- Why would I skip school?

85
00:08:21.982 --> 00:08:23.951
You have
a girlfriend. yeah?

86
00:08:23.951 --> 00:08:25.051
Do you even care
if I do?

87
00:08:25.051 --> 00:08:27.988
If you’re skipping school.
yeah. I care.

88
00:08:30.023 --> 00:08:33.961
Get in the car.
We’re going! Now!

89
00:08:39.571 --> 00:08:42.805
- Where’s your brother?
- I don’t know.
He was walking.

90
00:08:42.805 --> 00:08:44.675
Oh. jeez.

91
00:09:37.794 --> 00:09:39.961
Careful. careful.
What is that?

92
00:09:39.961 --> 00:09:42.095
For practice.
I have a match today.

93
00:09:42.095 --> 00:09:46.506
Well. don’t bounce it.
honey. I need to focus.

94
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.641
Are you coming?

95
00:09:51.973 --> 00:09:54.481
- Uh...

96
00:09:55.944 --> 00:09:59.145
- Um. I can’t.

97
00:09:59.453 --> 00:10:01.719
You don’t even know
when it is.

98
00:10:01.719 --> 00:10:03.622
Work is busy.

99
00:10:06.724 --> 00:10:09.628
Next one. I promise.

100
00:10:40.593 --> 00:10:42.628
Zach. get in.

101
00:10:43.530 --> 00:10:45.191
Zach.

102
00:10:45.466 --> 00:10:48.227
Can you just listen
for once?

103
00:10:48.997 --> 00:10:50.229
I can hear you.

104
00:10:50.229 --> 00:10:51.505
Zach. get in the car.

105
00:10:51.505 --> 00:10:56.510
- Or what?
- Get in the car right now!

106
00:10:58.237 --> 00:11:01.614
Zach. get in the car
this second!

107
00:11:01.977 --> 00:11:03.880
Please!

108
00:11:12.625 --> 00:11:15.958
Please. Come on.

109
00:11:27.266 --> 00:11:28.135
Thank you.

110
00:11:28.135 --> 00:11:29.741
I think I can see my bone.

111
00:11:29.741 --> 00:11:32.040
- Shut up.
-  Hey.

112
00:11:45.218 --> 00:11:47.693
- Call Unger.

113
00:11:51.796 --> 00:11:54.535
- Hello?
- Karl. it’s Matt.

114
00:11:54.535 --> 00:11:55.294
How’s Katherine?

115
00:11:55.294 --> 00:11:57.901
Telling me not to waste
any more of our children’s
inheritance.

116
00:11:57.901 --> 00:12:01.267
I heard.
When did you get
so sensitive?

117
00:12:01.267 --> 00:12:03.874
When my stock dropped
17% overnight.

118
00:12:03.874 --> 00:12:06.107
See it
as an opportunity.

119
00:12:06.107 --> 00:12:10.914
I see it as a trend.
Not in the right direction.

120
00:12:10.914 --> 00:12:11.882
I want out.

121
00:12:11.882 --> 00:12:13.983
What have I always
told you?

122
00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:16.623
"Predicting the rain
doesn’t count."

123
00:12:16.623 --> 00:12:18.218
"Building the Ark does."

124
00:12:18.218 --> 00:12:20.660
I thought that was
Warren Buffett.

125
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.090
So listen to him. then.

126
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:23.861
Turbulence is inevitable.

127
00:12:23.861 --> 00:12:26.028
When everyone runs
from the fire.

128
00:12:26.028 --> 00:12:28.195
you run to it.

129
00:12:28.195 --> 00:12:32.232
Karl. you’re investing in me.
That’s the deal.

130
00:12:32.232 --> 00:12:36.104
Maybe you’ve lost
your touch.

131
00:12:38.744 --> 00:12:40.680
Hey. how long
have we known each other?

132
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.650
- Eighteen years.
- Eighteen years.

133
00:12:43.650 --> 00:12:46.752
Do you remember what you said
to me the first time we met?

134
00:12:46.752 --> 00:12:50.250
That was
a long time ago.

135
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:51.185
Well. I remember.

136
00:12:51.185 --> 00:12:54.760
You told me you were tired
of playing it safe.

137
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:56.223
That you wanted
to be someone else.

138
00:12:56.223 --> 00:12:59.259
Like I said.
that was a long time ago.

139
00:12:59.259 --> 00:13:01.767
The man you are now.
I know you.

140
00:13:01.767 --> 00:13:05.100
You don’t run
from a challenge.
You take it on.

141
00:13:05.100 --> 00:13:07.674
You take on the uncertainty.
the risks.

142
00:13:07.674 --> 00:13:12.173
so you can give Katherine
everything she’s ever
dreamed of.

143
00:13:12.173 --> 00:13:13.273
You provide.

144
00:13:13.273 --> 00:13:14.879
Just look in the mirror
and ask.

145
00:13:14.879 --> 00:13:18.344
how you’ve provided
everything. How?

146
00:13:18.344 --> 00:13:21.347
Where you’ve come from
to get where we are?

147
00:13:21.347 --> 00:13:24.086
You’ve climbed up
that ladder.

148
00:13:24.086 --> 00:13:25.351
You can’t let go.

149
00:13:25.351 --> 00:13:29.025
I know you. Karl.
We’re the same.

150
00:13:29.025 --> 00:13:30.026
You walk away from me

151
00:13:30.026 --> 00:13:31.896
and you’re walking back
to that old life.

152
00:13:31.896 --> 00:13:36.197
And at our age.
you don’t come back
from that.

153
00:13:36.703 --> 00:13:41.070
Karl. are you looking
in that mirror?

154
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:42.368
Hmm?

155
00:13:46.878 --> 00:13:49.881
All right. I’m in.

156
00:13:50.783 --> 00:13:52.345
Is this why Anders
likes you so much?

157
00:13:52.345 --> 00:13:54.182
- You make people feel good

158
00:13:54.182 --> 00:13:57.757
about losing three million
euros in 24 hours?

159
00:13:57.757 --> 00:14:01.123
You’ll have to ask him. pal.

160
00:14:07.767 --> 00:14:10.737
Did you win. Daddy?

161
00:14:10.737 --> 00:14:12.134
Yeah.

162
00:14:12.739 --> 00:14:13.839
How?

163
00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:15.775
Eh. it’s complicated.

164
00:14:15.775 --> 00:14:18.811
It’s like I caught a fish.

165
00:14:18.811 --> 00:14:23.849
You use a nice big fat worm
and you dangle a hook and--

166
00:14:23.849 --> 00:14:25.345
You lie.

167
00:14:26.148 --> 00:14:28.216
It’s pretty easy.

168
00:14:37.192 --> 00:14:39.128
Someone important?

169
00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:41.427
- Her name’s Mila.
- Shut up.

170
00:14:41.427 --> 00:14:43.737
I wasn’t talking
to you. Zach.

171
00:14:43.737 --> 00:14:45.805
Well. you are right now.

172
00:14:46.102 --> 00:14:48.467
Hey. that’s enough.

173
00:15:00.248 --> 00:15:02.888
- Are you gonna answer that?
- What?

174
00:15:02.888 --> 00:15:06.320
Are you gonna answer that?

175
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.190
It’s not mine.

176
00:15:11.094 --> 00:15:14.493
- Is it Mom’s?
- No.

177
00:15:15.835 --> 00:15:16.770
Emily?

178
00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:18.937
It’s not mine.

179
00:15:51.233 --> 00:15:51.970
Hello?

180
00:15:51.970 --> 00:15:53.499
Hello. Matt.

181
00:15:53.499 --> 00:15:56.403
Hello. Yes. Who’s this?

182
00:15:58.075 --> 00:16:00.110
I like your car.

183
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.046
Sorry. who is this?

184
00:16:02.046 --> 00:16:05.346
You keep asking
the same question.

185
00:16:05.346 --> 00:16:07.315
Do you think
you’ll get an answer?

186
00:16:07.315 --> 00:16:10.153
- Sylvain?
- Not Sylvain.

187
00:16:10.153 --> 00:16:12.419
Just me. And you.

188
00:16:12.419 --> 00:16:14.058
I’m hanging up now.

189
00:16:14.058 --> 00:16:16.291
I wouldn’t do that.

190
00:16:18.964 --> 00:16:22.968
I said I like
your nice leather seats.

191
00:16:23.298 --> 00:16:27.434
But I wouldn’t really want
to be in that seat right now.

192
00:16:27.434 --> 00:16:29.271
All right. that’s enough.

193
00:16:29.271 --> 00:16:30.338
You hang up on me.

194
00:16:30.338 --> 00:16:35.211
they’ll be picking your guts
out of the trees
from here to Austria.

195
00:16:36.982 --> 00:16:41.855
Do I have
your attention?

196
00:16:42.251 --> 00:16:43.351
Matt Turner.

197
00:16:43.351 --> 00:16:46.024
there is a bomb
under your seat.

198
00:16:46.024 --> 00:16:50.325
You armed it
the second you sat down.

199
00:16:51.359 --> 00:16:53.493
- If you--

200
00:16:58.234 --> 00:16:59.334
Who was that?

201
00:16:59.334 --> 00:17:02.909
Um. no one.
No one. honey.

202
00:17:11.181 --> 00:17:12.985
Dad?

203
00:17:12.985 --> 00:17:15.922
- Dad? Dad. stop!
- Dad!

204
00:17:19.552 --> 00:17:22.522
Are you crazy?
You just missed the turn.

205
00:17:39.572 --> 00:17:41.409
Right here.

206
00:18:07.303 --> 00:18:09.503
You sure
this isn’t Mom’s?

207
00:18:09.503 --> 00:18:10.438
Pretty sure.

208
00:18:52.546 --> 00:18:54.482
Where are we?

209
00:18:55.989 --> 00:18:57.617
Um...

210
00:18:59.652 --> 00:19:00.455
Just. uh.

211
00:19:00.455 --> 00:19:03.623
- checking the car. sweetie.

212
00:19:05.427 --> 00:19:07.330
Your brand-freaking-new

213
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:09.233
100.000-euro car’s
breaking down?

214
00:19:09.233 --> 00:19:11.004
- Great. I’ll walk.
- Wait.

215
00:19:11.004 --> 00:19:13.402
- Wait.

216
00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.317
What is it?

217
00:19:49.636 --> 00:19:50.703
Dad. what’s wrong?

218
00:19:54.707 --> 00:19:56.643
Dad. who is that?

219
00:19:58.579 --> 00:20:00.713
-  Dad.
- Huh?

220
00:20:03.452 --> 00:20:04.222
No one.

221
00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:50.301
Hang up on me again
and I detonate.

222
00:20:50.301 --> 00:20:53.106
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

223
00:20:53.106 --> 00:20:53.766
Drive.

224
00:20:53.766 --> 00:20:55.537
- Don’t stop driving.

225
00:20:55.537 --> 00:20:58.705
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

226
00:21:01.576 --> 00:21:03.182
I didn’t hear you.

227
00:21:03.182 --> 00:21:04.678
Yes. I’m driving.

228
00:21:04.678 --> 00:21:07.615
Good. Now that I have
your attention.

229
00:21:07.615 --> 00:21:09.221
listen very carefully.

230
00:21:09.221 --> 00:21:11.421
The device is connected
to a pressure plate.

231
00:21:11.421 --> 00:21:15.359
If you get out of your seat.
the bomb will detonate.

232
00:21:15.359 --> 00:21:17.460
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

233
00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.824
There is a secondary trigger.

234
00:21:18.824 --> 00:21:22.696
a remote switch
that I am holding as we speak.

235
00:21:22.696 --> 00:21:24.236
If you try to call the police.

236
00:21:24.236 --> 00:21:26.700
- if you try to get help...

237
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:29.175
...I will detonate.

238
00:21:29.175 --> 00:21:30.242
I’m watching you.

239
00:21:30.242 --> 00:21:33.212
If you go somewhere
I don’t like.
I will detonate.

240
00:21:33.212 --> 00:21:36.512
Do you understand
everything I have said to you?

241
00:21:36.512 --> 00:21:38.316
Yes. What do you want?

242
00:21:38.316 --> 00:21:40.813
Don’t worry.
We’ll get to that.

243
00:21:40.813 --> 00:21:43.354
Look. I have
my children in the car.

244
00:21:43.354 --> 00:21:44.454
That’s interesting.

245
00:21:44.454 --> 00:21:46.819
- Let me get them out
and you and I can...
- No.

246
00:21:46.819 --> 00:21:48.392
Remember the first rule.

247
00:21:48.392 --> 00:21:49.624
The pressure plates. Matt.

248
00:21:49.624 --> 00:21:52.693
Wouldn’t want
to change the pressure.

249
00:21:52.693 --> 00:21:54.695
Keep it nice and heavy.

250
00:21:54.695 --> 00:21:58.303
You do exactly what I say.
when I say it.

251
00:21:58.303 --> 00:22:02.373
maybe you’ll get out of this
in one piece.

252
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.706
And so will they.

253
00:22:06.311 --> 00:22:11.184
Think of this day
as a profound
life experience.

254
00:22:11.184 --> 00:22:14.385
Did I-- did I do
something to you?

255
00:22:14.385 --> 00:22:19.159
If I did. I’m sorry.
just... just tell me.

256
00:22:19.159 --> 00:22:20.490
You sound so... guilty.

257
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:24.263
- What have you done. Matt?

258
00:22:26.496 --> 00:22:28.564
Whatever it is. I’m sorry.

259
00:22:28.564 --> 00:22:30.665
- Dad?
- I’m not convinced.

260
00:22:30.665 --> 00:22:32.667
Dad. you’re going
the wrong way.

261
00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:34.504
Zach. please.

262
00:22:34.867 --> 00:22:36.539
Jesus.

263
00:22:39.476 --> 00:22:41.247
Don’t you turn around.

264
00:22:45.284 --> 00:22:47.550
I’m watching you.

265
00:22:52.555 --> 00:22:55.624
- Look.

266
00:23:01.597 --> 00:23:04.237
Drive.

267
00:23:14.676 --> 00:23:16.513
Don’t stop driving.

268
00:23:16.513 --> 00:23:18.614
Do exactly what I say.

269
00:23:33.662 --> 00:23:35.961
I said I’m watching.

270
00:23:36.368 --> 00:23:38.997
Why does he keep going
the wrong way?

271
00:23:38.997 --> 00:23:40.372
Take your kids’ phones.

272
00:23:40.372 --> 00:23:42.572
Th-their phones?
What am I supposed to say?

273
00:23:42.572 --> 00:23:44.310
Say whatever you want.

274
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:45.003
And my phone?

275
00:23:45.003 --> 00:23:48.347
Keep it.
You’re going to need it.

276
00:23:48.347 --> 00:23:52.780
- I don’t think my children
are gonna like--
- Now!

277
00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:54.353
Zach.

278
00:23:54.353 --> 00:23:56.487
Zach!

279
00:23:56.817 --> 00:23:57.620
What?

280
00:23:57.620 --> 00:24:01.954
The kids’ phones.
I want them out of the car.

281
00:24:03.494 --> 00:24:04.462
Give me your phone.

282
00:24:04.462 --> 00:24:06.959
- Em. you too.
- What?

283
00:24:06.959 --> 00:24:07.729
Now!

284
00:24:07.729 --> 00:24:09.665
- Are you psycho? Why?
- Yeah. Why?

285
00:24:09.665 --> 00:24:11.271
I have no patience. Matt.

286
00:24:11.271 --> 00:24:14.604
I’m your father.
I said give me your phones.

287
00:24:14.604 --> 00:24:15.737
Why? What did I do?

288
00:24:15.737 --> 00:24:17.343
You almost took my finger off.

289
00:24:17.343 --> 00:24:18.806
- Zach!

290
00:24:19.576 --> 00:24:20.676
Throw the phones out

291
00:24:20.676 --> 00:24:24.482
- or kiss your kids goodbye.
-  Now!

292
00:24:26.616 --> 00:24:28.486
- Zach!
- What the hell. Dad?

293
00:24:28.486 --> 00:24:30.620
I told you
to get their phones.

294
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:31.918
I’m counting now.

295
00:24:31.918 --> 00:24:33.018
I hear you.

296
00:24:33.018 --> 00:24:34.327
Ten. nine...

297
00:24:34.327 --> 00:24:37.330
- ...eight. seven...

298
00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.365
- ...six.

299
00:24:39.365 --> 00:24:41.059
- five...
- I hear you.

300
00:24:41.059 --> 00:24:42.896
...four. three...

301
00:24:42.896 --> 00:24:44.997
- Hang on. kids!
- ...two...

302
00:24:49.804 --> 00:24:52.543
- What was that?
- Dad!

303
00:25:01.915 --> 00:25:03.884
Oh. my God. You just hit
Zach’s girlfriend!

304
00:25:03.884 --> 00:25:07.426
Hey. what is wrong with you?
You could’ve killed me!

305
00:25:07.426 --> 00:25:08.856
I told you they were
skipping school.

306
00:25:08.856 --> 00:25:11.331
- What are you doing?
- Accidents happen. Matt.

307
00:25:11.331 --> 00:25:12.959
- I’m... I’m getting out.
- No!

308
00:25:12.959 --> 00:25:14.466
-  Zach!
- Now drive.

309
00:25:14.466 --> 00:25:15.566
No. no. no. no.

310
00:25:15.566 --> 00:25:17.733
- I’m leaving.
- Stay in your seats!

311
00:25:17.733 --> 00:25:19.801
What the hell’s wrong
with you?

312
00:25:19.801 --> 00:25:21.506
-  Zach...

313
00:25:22.474 --> 00:25:24.905
Are you out of your mind?

314
00:25:25.708 --> 00:25:28.711
- Are you crazy?
You just hit her!
- Dad. stop it!

315
00:25:28.711 --> 00:25:30.350
What are you doing?

316
00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:31.615
Give me your phone. Zach.

317
00:25:31.615 --> 00:25:34.420
- What are you doing?
- Give me your phone! Now!

318
00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.653
No! Stop the car!

319
00:25:37.555 --> 00:25:39.117
There’s a bomb in this car!

320
00:25:45.431 --> 00:25:48.764
There’s a bomb in this car.

321
00:25:48.764 --> 00:25:52.537
If any of us get out.
the car blows up.

322
00:25:52.537 --> 00:25:54.902
If you don’t get rid
of your phone.

323
00:25:54.902 --> 00:25:56.970
the car blows up.

324
00:25:57.839 --> 00:25:59.610
A bomb?

325
00:25:59.610 --> 00:26:00.446
Now.

326
00:26:00.446 --> 00:26:02.976
- Get rid of them.
- Give me your phone.

327
00:26:04.879 --> 00:26:06.815
Thank you.

328
00:26:22.127 --> 00:26:23.095
Number one dad.

329
00:26:23.095 --> 00:26:25.471
Your kids really listen.
don’t they?

330
00:26:25.471 --> 00:26:26.802
I did what you asked.

331
00:26:26.802 --> 00:26:32.170
Good. Now drive
to this location.

332
00:26:34.810 --> 00:26:36.812
Where are we going?

333
00:26:41.751 --> 00:26:43.456
Why does he
want to hurt us?

334
00:26:43.456 --> 00:26:45.557
I don’t know. sweetie.

335
00:26:45.557 --> 00:26:48.153
Dad. what did you do?

336
00:26:54.434 --> 00:26:56.832
Answer that.

337
00:26:57.503 --> 00:26:59.670
- I don’t know
what you’re saying.
- Sylvain!

338
00:26:59.670 --> 00:27:02.167
- Sylvain. who is that?
- Wait. hold this. Matt?

339
00:27:02.167 --> 00:27:03.542
I’m freaking out
here. Okay?

340
00:27:03.542 --> 00:27:06.974
There’s a guy that called
and said that there’s a bomb
underneath the car.

341
00:27:06.974 --> 00:27:08.679
And if we get help.
it’ll blow up.

342
00:27:08.679 --> 00:27:10.780
- Stop! Just stop doing that!

343
00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:13.618
- No! I don’t understand.

344
00:27:13.618 --> 00:27:14.212
Matt.

345
00:27:14.212 --> 00:27:15.917
he said we’re gonna die
because of you.

346
00:27:15.917 --> 00:27:17.853
- No. Hey! Stop! Stop!

347
00:27:17.853 --> 00:27:21.791
- What else did he say?
- Wait. you know him?

348
00:27:21.791 --> 00:27:23.529
Just stop!
Would you stop doing that?

349
00:27:23.529 --> 00:27:25.025
- Please. please.

350
00:27:25.025 --> 00:27:27.698
Sylvain. steady on.
What else did he say?

351
00:27:27.698 --> 00:27:30.228
I don’t know. Stop.
He said to wait for you

352
00:27:30.228 --> 00:27:32.637
until you arrived.
That’s it.

353
00:27:32.637 --> 00:27:33.572
So there you are.

354
00:27:33.572 --> 00:27:35.706
No! No. don’t touch that.
Don’t touch that. Stop it.

355
00:27:35.706 --> 00:27:36.806
Just stop it for one second.

356
00:27:36.806 --> 00:27:38.643
Please. I don’t know
what you’re saying.

357
00:27:38.643 --> 00:27:40.139
Can you please be quiet
for one second?

358
00:27:43.615 --> 00:27:46.079
Matt. please?
I’m freaking out here. man.

359
00:27:46.079 --> 00:27:47.520
I know you are. Me too.

360
00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:48.983
But it’s important
that you stay calm.

361
00:27:48.983 --> 00:27:51.623
It’s easy for you to say.
"stay calm". There’s a bomb
underneath the car!

362
00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.495
Listen to me.

363
00:27:55.495 --> 00:27:58.828
- Listen to me. Listen to me.
He called me too.

364
00:27:58.828 --> 00:28:00.929
Which means
we’re in this together.

365
00:28:00.929 --> 00:28:02.700
We’re in what together?

366
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:03.668
Sylvain...

367
00:28:03.668 --> 00:28:05.703
Okay. well.
what did you do to him?

368
00:28:05.703 --> 00:28:06.770
I didn’t do anything.

369
00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:09.575
I need you to focus.
Did he say anything else?

370
00:28:09.575 --> 00:28:12.204
No. no. no.
I don’t want to die.

371
00:28:12.204 --> 00:28:13.942
Matt. I have a family.

372
00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:14.976
No. What are you doing?

373
00:28:14.976 --> 00:28:16.747
He said no phones.
Give me the fucking phone.

374
00:28:16.747 --> 00:28:18.782
- Stop. stop. stop. stop!

375
00:28:18.782 --> 00:28:22.181
- I don’t want to die. Matt.
- You’re not going to die.

376
00:28:22.181 --> 00:28:24.689
You just need
to stay calm and think.

377
00:28:24.689 --> 00:28:26.086
I am going to die
if you don’t...

378
00:28:26.086 --> 00:28:28.121
Don’t make
promises you can’t keep.

379
00:28:28.121 --> 00:28:30.728
Sylvain. there’s a police
officer walking towards you
right now.

380
00:28:30.728 --> 00:28:33.929
- Help! Help!
- Shh! Don’t say another word!

381
00:28:33.929 --> 00:28:36.536
- Help! No!
- No! No! Stop!

382
00:28:36.536 --> 00:28:37.702
Calm down now.

383
00:28:41.805 --> 00:28:43.609
Just be calm.

384
00:28:43.774 --> 00:28:44.940
Just be quiet.
Just be calm.

385
00:29:18.039 --> 00:29:19.007
No! No!

386
00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:22.142
- No!

387
00:29:34.253 --> 00:29:36.596
Zach. Em. are you okay?

388
00:29:36.596 --> 00:29:38.323
Answer me. Answer me.
Are you okay?

389
00:29:38.323 --> 00:29:40.864
- I’m okay.
- I’m okay.

390
00:29:58.981 --> 00:30:01.181
Zach. Emily. are you hurt?

391
00:30:01.181 --> 00:30:02.622
I’m good. I’m okay.

392
00:30:02.622 --> 00:30:04.052
Check her.
Check she’s okay.

393
00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:05.922
- She’s good. She’s good.
- I’m good.

394
00:30:05.922 --> 00:30:09.662
She should’ve listened.
- You didn’t have to do that!

395
00:30:09.662 --> 00:30:11.059
- She broke the rules.
- Rules?

396
00:30:11.059 --> 00:30:13.292
- You just killed three people.

397
00:30:13.292 --> 00:30:17.098
They weren’t the first.
But they can be the last.

398
00:30:17.098 --> 00:30:18.330
That’s entirely up to you.

399
00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:19.903
Why did you want me
to see that?

400
00:30:19.903 --> 00:30:22.741
So you won’t have any doubts
about my sincerity.

401
00:30:22.741 --> 00:30:26.173
Then take it out on me.
Just let my children go.

402
00:30:28.879 --> 00:30:31.684
- Who was that?
- Someone from work.

403
00:30:31.684 --> 00:30:33.114
Is that what
this is all about?

404
00:30:33.114 --> 00:30:35.754
I told you.
I don’t know.

405
00:30:37.789 --> 00:30:40.220
I’m... I’m sorry. Zach.

406
00:30:40.418 --> 00:30:42.662
it’s okay.

407
00:30:59.239 --> 00:31:02.011
Just tell me
what it is you want.

408
00:31:02.011 --> 00:31:03.012
I’m sure I can get it.

409
00:31:03.012 --> 00:31:07.852
I’m s-I’m sorry. I’m sorry
for whatever happened to you.

410
00:31:07.852 --> 00:31:08.886
I’m sorry.

411
00:31:08.886 --> 00:31:11.449
I want you
to call Heather.

412
00:31:11.449 --> 00:31:13.088
What? Why?

413
00:31:13.088 --> 00:31:17.422
You have a safety box
at the AIG bank
in Tiergarten.

414
00:31:17.422 --> 00:31:19.798
Heather is going
to retrieve it.

415
00:31:19.798 --> 00:31:21.866
This is about money?

416
00:31:21.866 --> 00:31:23.032
You can get someone else.

417
00:31:23.032 --> 00:31:25.199
She doesn’t deserve
to be mixed up in this.

418
00:31:25.199 --> 00:31:26.805
- What’s going on?
- Not now. Zach.

419
00:31:26.805 --> 00:31:29.709
You don’t have the luxury
of time to debate me.

420
00:31:29.709 --> 00:31:31.744
- Call Heather.

421
00:31:31.744 --> 00:31:32.712
Call Heather.

422
00:31:32.712 --> 00:31:35.176
And put her on speaker.

423
00:31:37.244 --> 00:31:41.754
This is Heather. I’m not here.
So say something nice.

424
00:31:43.019 --> 00:31:44.251
Heather. it’s me.

425
00:31:44.251 --> 00:31:47.859
Call me back immediately.
It’s urgent.

426
00:31:47.859 --> 00:31:49.190
She’s not answering.

427
00:31:49.190 --> 00:31:51.896
You’re an industrious man.

428
00:31:51.896 --> 00:31:54.767
Get ahold of her.
And quickly.

429
00:31:56.901 --> 00:31:59.937
- Call Christina.

430
00:32:03.435 --> 00:32:04.502
Hello?

431
00:32:04.502 --> 00:32:07.406
Christina. it’s Matt.
I need to speak to Heather.

432
00:32:07.406 --> 00:32:10.849
Heather?
Have you tried her phone?

433
00:32:10.849 --> 00:32:11.883
She’s not answering.

434
00:32:11.883 --> 00:32:13.753
I know she’s with you.
and I need to speak to her.

435
00:32:13.753 --> 00:32:15.447
- She’s not with me.
- Where is she?

436
00:32:15.447 --> 00:32:17.922
I need to get
ahold of her right now.

437
00:32:17.922 --> 00:32:20.287
- Matt...
- Tell me where she is.

438
00:32:20.287 --> 00:32:22.960
It’s a matter
of life and death.

439
00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.192
What’s happened?

440
00:32:24.192 --> 00:32:26.799
Christina. I don’t have
time to explain.

441
00:32:26.799 --> 00:32:30.198
I need to speak
to my wife right now.

442
00:32:32.101 --> 00:32:34.972
She’s at a divorce attorney.

443
00:32:34.972 --> 00:32:38.404
You haven’t been there
for her. Matt.

444
00:32:38.976 --> 00:32:42.782
What does that mean?

445
00:32:52.253 --> 00:32:55.058
- Which one?
- It’s in Lichtenberg.

446
00:32:55.058 --> 00:32:57.390
I don’t know.
Webber something.

447
00:32:57.390 --> 00:33:00.866
- Matt... you didn’t--

448
00:33:06.465 --> 00:33:09.336
You have
two minutes to find her.

449
00:33:09.336 --> 00:33:12.174
Then you know what happens.

450
00:33:14.847 --> 00:33:15.474
I found her.

451
00:33:15.474 --> 00:33:18.048
-  No.

452
00:33:28.894 --> 00:33:32.029
Webber and Babel.

453
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:35.428
Um. I need to speak
to Heather Turner. please.

454
00:33:35.428 --> 00:33:38.596
I’m sorry. There’s
no Heather Turner here.

455
00:33:38.596 --> 00:33:40.268
This is Matt Turner speaking.

456
00:33:40.268 --> 00:33:43.337
I’m her husband.
This is an emergency.

457
00:33:43.337 --> 00:33:46.142
I need to speak to her now.

458
00:33:46.142 --> 00:33:47.979
Well. I’m sorry. I...

459
00:33:47.979 --> 00:33:50.608
Our children are in trouble.

460
00:33:50.608 --> 00:33:52.918
One moment. please.

461
00:33:55.217 --> 00:33:56.383
Are the kids okay?

462
00:33:56.383 --> 00:33:59.353
They’re fine.
I had to get you on the phone.

463
00:33:59.353 --> 00:34:02.994
Listen to me.
Something’s happened.

464
00:34:02.994 --> 00:34:04.864
I need you to stay calm.

465
00:34:04.864 --> 00:34:06.492
You’re scaring me. Matt.

466
00:34:06.492 --> 00:34:09.132
Just listen. please.

467
00:34:09.132 --> 00:34:12.971
- There’s a man... there’s...

468
00:34:13.301 --> 00:34:16.942
There’s a man
who’s put a bomb in the car.

469
00:34:16.942 --> 00:34:17.602
What?

470
00:34:17.602 --> 00:34:20.077
We have to do
everything he says.

471
00:34:20.077 --> 00:34:21.309
What are you talking about?

472
00:34:21.309 --> 00:34:23.344
Heather. please.
Just listen
to what I tell you.

473
00:34:23.344 --> 00:34:26.149
Emily?
Sweetheart. are you okay?

474
00:34:26.149 --> 00:34:28.085
Heather. she’s fine.
They’re both fine.

475
00:34:28.085 --> 00:34:30.351
- Is Zach okay?
- Yes. Yes. he’s fine.

476
00:34:30.351 --> 00:34:34.652
- Have you called the police?
- No. No. we can’t.

477
00:34:34.652 --> 00:34:36.555
Then I’m calling them.

478
00:34:36.555 --> 00:34:37.457
Heather. please.

479
00:34:37.457 --> 00:34:39.162
Just listen
to what I have to tell you.

480
00:34:39.162 --> 00:34:41.934
If you call the police.
he will...

481
00:34:43.001 --> 00:34:44.530
He...

482
00:34:45.498 --> 00:34:46.499
Do you understand?

483
00:34:46.499 --> 00:34:48.303
No. I don’t
understand. Matt.

484
00:34:48.303 --> 00:34:50.976
What you’re saying
doesn’t make any sense.

485
00:34:50.976 --> 00:34:52.637
Who is he?

486
00:34:53.044 --> 00:34:53.979
I don’t know.

487
00:34:53.979 --> 00:34:56.179
Right now. we just
have to do what he says.

488
00:34:56.179 --> 00:35:00.348
And everything will be
fi-fine. Okay.

489
00:35:00.348 --> 00:35:02.647
Oh. my God. Matt. What?

490
00:35:02.647 --> 00:35:07.256
I need you to go
to the AIG bank
in Tiergarten.

491
00:35:07.256 --> 00:35:10.556
There’s a safety
deposit box in my name.

492
00:35:10.556 --> 00:35:11.425
What?

493
00:35:11.425 --> 00:35:16.001
When you get there.
they will ask to speak to me.

494
00:35:16.001 --> 00:35:18.069
You call me. okay?

495
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:20.038
Then what?

496
00:35:21.468 --> 00:35:22.568
I don’t know.

497
00:35:24.108 --> 00:35:26.044
Heather. I’m...

498
00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.541
- Look. if...

499
00:35:28.541 --> 00:35:32.314
If I wasn’t
enough for you. I’m...

500
00:35:35.218 --> 00:35:39.453
I’m sorry.
I’m so sorry.

501
00:35:58.307 --> 00:36:01.244
It’s gonna be okay. Dad.

502
00:36:02.212 --> 00:36:03.983
You bet.

503
00:36:05.479 --> 00:36:08.218
-  Yeah.

504
00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:14.356
There’s
that number-one dad again.

505
00:36:14.356 --> 00:36:16.688
You better find
somewhere to lay low

506
00:36:16.688 --> 00:36:20.131
until she’s at your big bank.

507
00:36:20.131 --> 00:36:22.760
Remember. Matt.
I’m watching you.

508
00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:26.038
Don’t do anything stupid.

509
00:37:01.205 --> 00:37:03.042
I’m waiting.

510
00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:05.737
Hello? I’m waiting.

511
00:37:06.738 --> 00:37:08.410
Hello?

512
00:37:46.547 --> 00:37:48.549
We’ve just begun
our investigation.

513
00:37:48.549 --> 00:37:52.751
Any speculation at this time
is just that. speculation.

514
00:37:52.751 --> 00:37:54.357
Can you at least say

515
00:37:54.357 --> 00:37:56.722
whether you’re looking
for one suspect
or multiple suspects?

516
00:37:56.722 --> 00:37:58.493
Everything’s
on the table.

517
00:37:58.493 --> 00:38:01.166
Because of the protests.
will you shut down the city?

518
00:38:01.166 --> 00:38:02.728
No. not at this time.

519
00:38:02.728 --> 00:38:04.400
Thank you. Danke.

520
00:38:21.120 --> 00:38:23.782
- You worked with him too.

521
00:38:23.782 --> 00:38:26.785
The first guy.
That’s your company.

522
00:38:28.226 --> 00:38:30.129
It is. Yeah.

523
00:38:30.129 --> 00:38:33.396
Dad. what did you do?

524
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:36.597
Nothing.

525
00:38:36.894 --> 00:38:37.730
Stop lying.

526
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:39.864
This guy is trying to kill us
because of something you did.

527
00:38:39.864 --> 00:38:43.307
- Look.
- I didn’t do anything.

528
00:38:43.307 --> 00:38:46.277
Nothing to deserve this.

529
00:38:47.410 --> 00:38:50.611
Are you and Mom
getting a divorce?

530
00:38:51.744 --> 00:38:53.482
What?

531
00:38:54.648 --> 00:38:55.418
No.

532
00:38:55.418 --> 00:38:58.883
See? You lie.
It’s what you do every day.

533
00:38:58.883 --> 00:39:01.556
To Mom. To them. To us.

534
00:39:01.556 --> 00:39:04.757
- No. I promise.
- You promise what?

535
00:39:04.757 --> 00:39:08.629
You made me get in this car.
You made me.

536
00:39:08.761 --> 00:39:13.172
I promise I will get you out.
Both of you.

537
00:39:14.338 --> 00:39:15.504
Zach.

538
00:39:15.504 --> 00:39:17.935
Listen to me. I promise.

539
00:39:18.771 --> 00:39:20.443
Okay.

540
00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:36.360
- She’s calling.
- Pick up.

541
00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:38.791
Tell her you’ll meet her
outside the bank.

542
00:39:38.791 --> 00:39:42.267
She hands you the money
and then leaves.

543
00:39:42.267 --> 00:39:45.534
No conversation. Nothing.

544
00:39:50.374 --> 00:39:52.937
I’m here at the bank.
They want to speak to you.

545
00:39:52.937 --> 00:39:55.412
Good. Put them on.

546
00:39:55.412 --> 00:39:57.249
-  Mr. Turner?
- Yes.

547
00:39:57.249 --> 00:39:58.976
I understand your wife
would like to access

548
00:39:58.976 --> 00:40:01.946
your safe deposit box
on your behalf?

549
00:40:01.946 --> 00:40:02.881
That’s correct.

550
00:40:02.881 --> 00:40:07.655
- The password is "Siena."
- Thank you. sir.

551
00:40:07.655 --> 00:40:10.526
What’s in the box. Matt?
- My passport.

552
00:40:10.526 --> 00:40:14.233
uh. some personal items
and 50.000 euros.

553
00:40:14.233 --> 00:40:16.697
Heather. just call me
when you get out.

554
00:40:16.697 --> 00:40:18.468
I’ll be waiting
for you outside.

555
00:40:18.468 --> 00:40:20.701
Put the money
in the passenger seat

556
00:40:20.701 --> 00:40:22.571
- and walk away.
- I...

557
00:40:22.571 --> 00:40:24.001
- I’m serious.
- Okay.

558
00:40:24.001 --> 00:40:27.444
And Heather...
listen to me.

559
00:40:27.444 --> 00:40:31.580
The kids are going to be okay.
I promise you.

560
00:40:34.385 --> 00:40:35.320
What’s Siena?

561
00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.653
It’s where I met
your mom. sweetie.

562
00:40:39.984 --> 00:40:41.986
Are we gonna see Mom?

563
00:40:41.986 --> 00:40:42.855
Yes. love.

564
00:40:42.855 --> 00:40:47.629
But you won’t be able to talk
to her right now. Okay?

565
00:40:57.639 --> 00:40:59.542
Matt. I’m coming out.

566
00:41:02.809 --> 00:41:03.975
Look down the street.

567
00:41:03.975 --> 00:41:06.285
Do you see us?

568
00:41:06.615 --> 00:41:08.012
Uh...

569
00:41:14.524 --> 00:41:16.053
Yes.

570
00:41:17.054 --> 00:41:20.497
Mom. Mom.

571
00:41:22.532 --> 00:41:23.434
I’ve got it.

572
00:41:23.434 --> 00:41:24.831
Change of plan.

573
00:41:24.831 --> 00:41:29.440
There’s a man in a blue suit
sitting alone on a bench.

574
00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:33.004
Tell her to go to him
and give him the bag.

575
00:41:33.004 --> 00:41:35.039
That’s not what you said.

576
00:41:35.039 --> 00:41:36.348
I give the instructions.

577
00:41:36.348 --> 00:41:38.317
She does that
and she walks free?

578
00:41:38.317 --> 00:41:39.549
You give me your word?

579
00:41:39.549 --> 00:41:41.551
Of course.

580
00:41:41.551 --> 00:41:42.321
Heather.

581
00:41:42.321 --> 00:41:44.081
There’s a man sitting
on a bench in the square.

582
00:41:44.081 --> 00:41:47.491
He’s wearing a blue suit.
Do you see him?

583
00:41:47.491 --> 00:41:48.052
Yes.

584
00:41:48.052 --> 00:41:50.054
Give him the money.
Then walk away.

585
00:41:50.054 --> 00:41:51.693
What about you
and the kids?

586
00:41:51.693 --> 00:41:54.762
We’ll be fine.
Just... just do it. please.

587
00:41:54.762 --> 00:41:58.370
Okay.

588
00:42:02.099 --> 00:42:05.003
It’s all...
it’s all there.

589
00:42:05.003 --> 00:42:05.872
Excuse me?

590
00:42:05.872 --> 00:42:07.808
The money.
it’s all there.

591
00:42:07.808 --> 00:42:09.106
What...
what money?

592
00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:17.653
What? What? What?

593
00:42:18.654 --> 00:42:19.721
- No.

594
00:42:19.721 --> 00:42:23.395
- Dad. why are they
doing that? Dad. help her!
- No. no. No!

595
00:42:23.395 --> 00:42:26.365
Wait. Wait.

596
00:42:26.794 --> 00:42:28.829
Drive!

597
00:42:42.777 --> 00:42:45.615
I didn’t call them. I swear.
Please believe me.

598
00:42:45.615 --> 00:42:47.716
I called them.

599
00:42:48.145 --> 00:42:51.654
- Why?
- There is no why.

600
00:42:51.654 --> 00:42:55.020
You didn’t want me
to see Sylvain die.

601
00:42:55.394 --> 00:42:57.561
You wanted me
to be seen there.

602
00:42:57.561 --> 00:42:58.760
My car. Me.

603
00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:00.894
Trust me. Matt.
you’re not as smart
as you think you are.

604
00:43:00.894 --> 00:43:02.632
or your escape plan
would involve

605
00:43:02.632 --> 00:43:06.031
more than a safety
deposit box
at a local bank.

606
00:43:06.031 --> 00:43:09.540
- What escape plan?
- Take your money and run.

607
00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:12.510
Your investors’ money.
Dubai.

608
00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:13.104
Dubai?

609
00:43:13.104 --> 00:43:15.777
The little slush fund
that you and Anders have.

610
00:43:15.777 --> 00:43:17.779
safe and tucked away
in the desert.

611
00:43:17.779 --> 00:43:21.948
208 million euros
emergency collateral.

612
00:43:28.427 --> 00:43:31.958
- What is this?

613
00:43:32.530 --> 00:43:34.598
Hey. I asked you a question.

614
00:43:34.598 --> 00:43:37.832
I think we should
talk to your boss.

615
00:43:39.064 --> 00:43:40.670
Anders? Why?

616
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:44.542
If you can’t help me.
maybe he can.

617
00:43:45.004 --> 00:43:46.137
I don’t think this is a--

618
00:43:46.137 --> 00:43:48.975
This is no time
to start playing games. Matt.

619
00:43:48.975 --> 00:43:53.144
He’s already
waiting for you. Drive.

620
00:44:14.033 --> 00:44:18.103
Hey. asshole.
Can you hear me?

621
00:44:20.006 --> 00:44:22.580
Zach. look at this photo.

622
00:44:22.580 --> 00:44:23.746
Am I seeing it right?

623
00:44:23.746 --> 00:44:26.716
Does that look
like a phone to you?

624
00:44:29.213 --> 00:44:30.687
Yeah. I think so.

625
00:44:30.687 --> 00:44:32.953
Good. Good.

626
00:44:32.953 --> 00:44:36.121
- A phone.
- Is that good?

627
00:44:36.825 --> 00:44:38.596
Yeah. It might be.

628
00:44:38.596 --> 00:44:42.259
Great. More phones.

629
00:44:42.798 --> 00:44:45.097
- Dad?
- Yes. baby?

630
00:44:45.097 --> 00:44:47.198
You called him an asshole.

631
00:44:49.871 --> 00:44:51.972
Good.

632
00:44:53.545 --> 00:44:57.010
- Shit. Dad?
- Yeah?

633
00:44:59.045 --> 00:45:00.915
You’re on TV.

634
00:45:16.029 --> 00:45:17.162
Hello? Hello?

635
00:45:21.001 --> 00:45:22.299
- Heather.
- Mr. Turner.

636
00:45:22.299 --> 00:45:26.105
this is Angela Brickmann
with Europol.

637
00:45:26.105 --> 00:45:27.238
Europol?

638
00:45:27.238 --> 00:45:28.547
I’m with your wife.

639
00:45:28.547 --> 00:45:30.945
I’ve got to say. we’re all
very concerned about you.

640
00:45:30.945 --> 00:45:33.079
I’m not responsible
for all this.

641
00:45:33.079 --> 00:45:35.851
That’s good to hear.
I believe you.

642
00:45:35.851 --> 00:45:37.281
Do not patronize me.

643
00:45:37.281 --> 00:45:38.689
I’m telling you.
I’m innocent.

644
00:45:38.689 --> 00:45:41.021
If that’s the case.
letting your children go

645
00:45:41.021 --> 00:45:42.858
would be a great way
to demonstrate that.

646
00:45:42.858 --> 00:45:45.828
- I can’t.
- And why is that?

647
00:45:45.828 --> 00:45:47.731
This isn’t
what it looks like.

648
00:45:47.731 --> 00:45:50.602
Tell me what it looks like.

649
00:45:50.602 --> 00:45:52.164
There’s a bomb in my car.

650
00:45:52.164 --> 00:45:54.804
- Like the others?
- Yes.

651
00:45:54.804 --> 00:45:58.742
Matt. you can
let your children go.

652
00:45:58.742 --> 00:45:59.677
It’s not me.

653
00:45:59.677 --> 00:46:01.041
You have to believe me.
There’s a man--

654
00:46:01.041 --> 00:46:03.978
Who called you. your wife says
that’s what you told her.

655
00:46:03.978 --> 00:46:06.244
It’s not my job
to believe you.
Mr. Turner.

656
00:46:06.244 --> 00:46:08.279
It’s my job to stop
people from dying.

657
00:46:08.279 --> 00:46:11.854
and to get
your children out safely.

658
00:46:12.624 --> 00:46:14.120
I have to trust you.

659
00:46:14.120 --> 00:46:15.957
God damn it.
listen to me.

660
00:46:15.957 --> 00:46:17.321
I’m listening.

661
00:46:17.321 --> 00:46:19.191
Can you stop cell phones
from working?

662
00:46:19.191 --> 00:46:22.997
Now. why would I do that
if I could? We wouldn’t
be able to talk.

663
00:46:22.997 --> 00:46:27.606
Because the bomb appears
to have cell phone failsafe.

664
00:46:27.606 --> 00:46:30.136
A pressure plate
and cell phone. okay?

665
00:46:30.136 --> 00:46:32.941
- And?
- Then he can’t detonate it.

666
00:46:32.941 --> 00:46:36.615
- Who is he?
- Listen to me.
Shut off the phones!

667
00:46:36.615 --> 00:46:38.716
I want to help you. Matt.
but I can’t do that.

668
00:46:38.716 --> 00:46:41.279
- Emergency services. police...
-  Matt?

669
00:46:41.279 --> 00:46:43.281
- ... you aren’t the only man...
- Answer me.

670
00:46:43.281 --> 00:46:46.053
- You hung up?

671
00:46:46.053 --> 00:46:48.187
- What if they could’ve
helped us?
- Ten.

672
00:46:48.187 --> 00:46:50.288
- nine. eight...
- I’m here.

673
00:46:50.288 --> 00:46:52.763
I’m here.
What do you want?

674
00:46:52.763 --> 00:46:54.358
You think I’m stupid?

675
00:46:54.358 --> 00:46:55.832
Taking your time?

676
00:46:55.832 --> 00:46:58.868
You better drive faster.

677
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:02.069
Two minutes.

678
00:47:02.971 --> 00:47:05.941
The police come to help us
and he finds out.

679
00:47:05.941 --> 00:47:06.975
you know what he’ll do.

680
00:47:06.975 --> 00:47:10.308
- Will he kill us?
- Oh. God.

681
00:47:10.946 --> 00:47:12.178
No. honey.

682
00:47:12.178 --> 00:47:15.082
No. I’m... just...

683
00:47:15.082 --> 00:47:18.954
I can’t risk you.
You understand?

684
00:47:19.691 --> 00:47:21.759
I won’t risk you.

685
00:47:21.759 --> 00:47:26.698
I can help us.

686
00:48:40.002 --> 00:48:44.105
- We’re here.
- Patience. Matt.

687
00:49:01.518 --> 00:49:04.257
Put him on speaker.

688
00:49:06.292 --> 00:49:09.834
- Call Anders.

689
00:49:17.941 --> 00:49:19.437
Matt...

690
00:49:20.405 --> 00:49:23.144
Why are you doing this?

691
00:49:23.408 --> 00:49:24.948
Anders.

692
00:49:24.948 --> 00:49:27.379
What have I ever done to you?

693
00:49:32.219 --> 00:49:34.221
Nothing. nothing. Listen...

694
00:49:34.221 --> 00:49:35.486
What kind of fucking psycho

695
00:49:35.486 --> 00:49:38.126
does this to his own
best friend?

696
00:49:38.126 --> 00:49:39.996
And you brought your kids!

697
00:49:39.996 --> 00:49:43.835
Anders. it’s gonna be
okay. Just...

698
00:49:43.835 --> 00:49:44.869
just look at me.

699
00:49:44.869 --> 00:49:47.465
- Hey. Hey.
-  Jesus.

700
00:49:47.465 --> 00:49:49.533
Matt. why?

701
00:49:49.533 --> 00:49:51.436
I don’t have time for this.

702
00:49:51.436 --> 00:49:56.815
Tell him to authorize liquidating
your collateral account.

703
00:49:57.376 --> 00:50:02.018
That isn’t my money.
I didn’t steal it.
It’s the clients’.

704
00:50:02.018 --> 00:50:04.284
If you’re punishing me.
you should know that.

705
00:50:04.284 --> 00:50:08.090
Matt. just...
tell me what you want.

706
00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:11.489
If I did something

Mr. Turner?

884
01:04:49.432 --> 01:04:51.038
Call me whatever you want.

885
01:04:51.038 --> 01:04:53.106
Just get us out of this car.

886
01:04:53.106 --> 01:04:55.438
Your children
can get out right now

887
01:04:55.438 --> 01:04:57.913
if that’s all right. Matt.

888
01:04:57.913 --> 01:05:00.344
The car will explode.

889
01:05:00.344 --> 01:05:03.787
I see. If they get out.
the car explodes.

890
01:05:11.861 --> 01:05:15.128
Under our seats.
there are pressure triggers.

891
01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:18.395
Well. our friends here
are looking into that.
aren’t they?

892
01:05:18.395 --> 01:05:22.267
You turned off the phones. yeah?

893
01:05:30.979 --> 01:05:34.477
We’ve jammed cell signal
for five blocks.
You should be honored.

894
01:05:34.477 --> 01:05:35.511
They haven’t interrupted

895
01:05:35.511 --> 01:05:40.153
the telephone service
in Berlin since 1945.

896
01:05:41.055 --> 01:05:43.420
Nice to unplug for a minute.

897
01:05:54.464 --> 01:05:58.369
You say that he
called you on that?

898
01:05:58.908 --> 01:06:00.371
Do you know who he is?

899
01:06:00.371 --> 01:06:03.176
If I knew that.
I would tell you.

900
01:06:03.176 --> 01:06:05.013
Just get them out.

901
01:06:05.013 --> 01:06:07.477
Look at my daughter. please.

902
01:06:09.886 --> 01:06:12.922
Okay.

903
01:06:13.857 --> 01:06:15.991
They think
the doors are clear.

904
01:06:15.991 --> 01:06:18.026
We’d like to open them.

905
01:06:45.823 --> 01:06:48.155
So. three colleagues
from your company

906
01:06:48.155 --> 01:06:50.388
die in one day.
but not you.

907
01:06:50.388 --> 01:06:53.996
I didn’t do this.
I didn’t set off
those bombs.

908
01:06:53.996 --> 01:06:56.196
Okay. Understood.

909
01:06:58.594 --> 01:06:59.936
It’s gonna be okay. okay?

910
01:06:59.936 --> 01:07:01.531
But why would
someone do this to you?

911
01:07:01.531 --> 01:07:04.105
- I’ll have a look
under your seat now.
- Why you. Matt?

912
01:07:04.105 --> 01:07:05.040
To punish you?

913
01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.273
-  Money.
- You can get money
robbing a bank...

914
01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:13.015
- ...or working
a fancy job like yours.

915
01:07:13.015 --> 01:07:14.984
Not this kind of money.

916
01:07:16.315 --> 01:07:18.449
What kind of money?

917
01:07:23.520 --> 01:07:27.260
Trust. Matt.
I need trust.

918
01:07:27.557 --> 01:07:30.494
You’ve had a lot of losses
for your clients.

919
01:07:30.494 --> 01:07:32.463
but you still have
a nice car.

920
01:07:32.463 --> 01:07:35.037
Do I?

921
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:38.304
Well. I guess
you’ve had a tough day.

922
01:07:38.304 --> 01:07:41.472
A tough week?
A tough year?

923
01:07:41.637 --> 01:07:44.981
How much did your clients
lose this year?

924
01:07:44.981 --> 01:07:47.643
We all lost this year.

925
01:07:47.643 --> 01:07:51.119
Well. I know that you
and your recent colleagues

926
01:07:51.119 --> 01:07:54.023
lost a lot of money
for your trusting clients

927
01:07:54.023 --> 01:07:55.959
who invested in your fund.

928
01:07:55.959 --> 01:07:58.621
yet you kept
making promises.

929
01:07:58.621 --> 01:08:03.164
Promises
that profits would appear.

930
01:08:03.593 --> 01:08:05.595
Maybe he’s an angry client.

931
01:08:05.595 --> 01:08:07.300
"An angry client." Mm.

932
01:08:07.300 --> 01:08:11.040
What kind of money
did you say he wanted?

933
01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.976
Just hurry up. please.

934
01:08:12.976 --> 01:08:14.637
What kind of money?

935
01:08:15.374 --> 01:08:18.575
208 million euros.

936
01:08:19.576 --> 01:08:22.645
All Nanite Capital accounts
have been frozen.

937
01:08:22.645 --> 01:08:26.484
So. how does he plan
to access this money?

938
01:08:26.484 --> 01:08:29.322
The account’s based
in Dubai.

939
01:08:29.322 --> 01:08:32.193
It’s outside
your jurisdiction.

940
01:08:32.193 --> 01:08:35.031
Who knows
about this account?

941
01:08:35.262 --> 01:08:37.066
Partners in the firm.

942
01:08:37.066 --> 01:08:39.365
How many are still alive?

943
01:08:43.270 --> 01:08:44.040
Just me.

944
01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:46.174
It’s clear
back here. No device.

945
01:08:46.174 --> 01:08:47.978
No pressure plates
in the back.

946
01:08:47.978 --> 01:08:50.607
He said it was
under our seats.

947
01:08:52.576 --> 01:08:54.083
What are you waiting for?

948
01:09:00.518 --> 01:09:03.719
We’re getting your children
out now. but...

949
01:09:03.719 --> 01:09:05.028
Please. hurry.

950
01:09:05.028 --> 01:09:06.722
But the bomb under your seat

951
01:09:06.722 --> 01:09:09.428
is hardwired
to the seat sensors.

952
01:09:09.428 --> 01:09:11.364
Even if we take out
the car battery.

953
01:09:11.364 --> 01:09:12.695
shut down the car’s CPI.

954
01:09:12.695 --> 01:09:16.468
you get up. it will
still trigger the bomb.

955
01:09:16.468 --> 01:09:17.634
Grab my shoulder.

956
01:09:17.634 --> 01:09:21.539
There you go. Em.
Em. go. It’s okay.

957
01:09:22.012 --> 01:09:24.608
Baby. it’s okay.
It’s okay. baby.

958
01:09:24.608 --> 01:09:27.611
It’s okay. I love you.

959
01:09:31.714 --> 01:09:33.122
Dad.

960
01:09:35.993 --> 01:09:39.326
Dad. I’m not gonna
leave you.

961
01:09:40.096 --> 01:09:43.264
- Uh. I’ll be fine.
- If you stay. I stay.

962
01:09:43.264 --> 01:09:45.233
- Go with your sister.
- Dad...

963
01:09:45.233 --> 01:09:48.599
You just tell that girlfriend
of yours. um. Mila.

964
01:09:48.599 --> 01:09:52.108
I hope I can still meet her.
Yeah?

965
01:09:52.108 --> 01:09:53.439
- I hope so too.
- Yeah.

966
01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:56.640
I made a promise
I’d get you out.

967
01:09:57.113 --> 01:09:59.610
I love you. Zach.
Go on.

968
01:09:59.610 --> 01:10:01.150
Love you too.

969
01:10:01.150 --> 01:10:03.548
I’m gonna fix this.

970
01:10:05.286 --> 01:10:07.090
Good boy.

971
01:10:15.758 --> 01:10:18.365
- Mom.

972
01:10:19.267 --> 01:10:21.797
- I’m okay.
- Oh. sweetie.

973
01:10:29.706 --> 01:10:31.642
Can it be deactivated?

974
01:10:31.642 --> 01:10:33.215
We’re still working on it.

975
01:10:33.215 --> 01:10:34.711
Can I talk to my wife?

976
01:10:34.711 --> 01:10:38.814
You will.
When we get you out.

977
01:10:39.155 --> 01:10:42.389
I need to talk
to her. Please.

978
01:10:49.528 --> 01:10:51.266
Okay.

979
01:10:56.766 --> 01:11:00.209
- Ma’am?
- Oh. Oh.

980
01:11:00.737 --> 01:11:03.146
Thank you.

981
01:11:04.576 --> 01:11:06.314
Matt?

982
01:11:06.314 --> 01:11:08.382
- Honey...

983
01:11:08.382 --> 01:11:09.317
Are you okay?

984
01:11:09.317 --> 01:11:12.683
Uh. I’ve had better days.

985
01:11:15.752 --> 01:11:18.788
I didn’t do this.
I want you to know that.

986
01:11:18.788 --> 01:11:22.099
Matt. just do whatever
the police say.

987
01:11:22.099 --> 01:11:25.465
Just listen to them
and they’ll get you out. okay?

988
01:11:25.465 --> 01:11:28.633
You have to do as they say.

989
01:11:32.373 --> 01:11:33.242
Matt?

990
01:11:33.242 --> 01:11:36.740
I’m sorry.
I’m sorry about everything.

991
01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.775
I-I should’ve
been there for you.

992
01:11:38.775 --> 01:11:41.877
- For all of you.

993
01:11:43.549 --> 01:11:45.782
Don’t say that.

994
01:11:46.816 --> 01:11:49.159
I love you. baby.

995
01:11:49.159 --> 01:11:50.886
I always have.

996
01:11:52.558 --> 01:11:54.593
Just come home.

997
01:11:55.726 --> 01:11:58.762
- We’ll be okay.
- I will.

998
01:11:58.762 --> 01:12:01.435
- Okay.
- Come on.

999
01:12:17.187 --> 01:12:20.322
You’re all here
focused on me.

1000
01:12:20.718 --> 01:12:22.489
And he is still out there.

1001
01:12:22.489 --> 01:12:24.491
He’s the one
that did this to me.

1002
01:12:24.491 --> 01:12:27.164
You don’t have
to worry about that.

1003
01:12:27.164 --> 01:12:28.924
We’ll find him.

1004
01:12:30.827 --> 01:12:33.368
You don’t believe me.

1005
01:12:33.368 --> 01:12:37.372
What I believe right now
is irrelevant.

1006
01:12:37.372 --> 01:12:39.209
I can find him.

1007
01:12:39.209 --> 01:12:42.905
Matt. you go into custody.
We’ll work through this.

1008
01:12:42.905 --> 01:12:46.612
We’ll walk through
every possibility.

1009
01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:48.878
You have my word on that.

1010
01:12:50.715 --> 01:12:51.947
No.

1011
01:12:53.256 --> 01:12:56.523
He set me up
and you all bought it.

1012
01:12:56.919 --> 01:13:00.197
Right now. we’re trying
to get you out of this car.

1013
01:13:00.197 --> 01:13:02.298
That is my only objective.

1014
01:13:04.531 --> 01:13:07.831
You have your objective.
and I have mine.

1015
01:13:07.963 --> 01:13:11.835
If you can’t find him.
I will.

1016
01:13:11.835 --> 01:13:12.638
Matt...

1017
01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:15.410
Tell them to stand down.

1018
01:13:19.381 --> 01:13:20.415
Tell them to stand down.

1019
01:13:20.415 --> 01:13:23.286
Matt. if you leave.
I cannot protect you.

1020
01:13:23.286 --> 01:13:24.617
I want to be clear
about that.

1021
01:13:24.617 --> 01:13:25.948
- Matt! Matt!

1022
01:13:25.948 --> 01:13:29.457
- Don’t shoot! Don’t shoot!

1023
01:13:29.952 --> 01:13:33.263
- No!

1024
01:14:00.917 --> 01:14:04.294
- You hearing this?

1025
01:14:06.494 --> 01:14:10.729
You want your money.
I want my life back.

1026
01:14:15.030 --> 01:14:18.341
Transfer the money. Now!

1027
01:14:26.877 --> 01:14:29.484
Face to face.
Or you get nothing.

1028
01:14:29.484 --> 01:14:32.454
I could end this right now.

1029
01:14:39.494 --> 01:14:42.629
So. what’s it gonna be?

1030
01:14:43.432 --> 01:14:44.829
End it!

1031
01:14:45.863 --> 01:14:48.602
End it! End it!

1032
01:14:49.438 --> 01:14:52.408
I choose the address.
Not you.

1033
01:16:49.151 --> 01:16:51.791
Hello. Matt.

1034
01:16:51.791 --> 01:16:55.828
I just need to press send
and we both go up.

1035
01:16:55.828 --> 01:16:59.667
along with a lot
of innocent people.

1036
01:17:05.068 --> 01:17:06.938
Now drive.

1037
01:17:08.874 --> 01:17:11.514
I said drive.

1038
01:17:12.141 --> 01:17:13.549
Where?

1039
01:17:13.549 --> 01:17:16.651
How about someplace
a little more quiet?

1040
01:17:40.103 --> 01:17:43.040
Surprise.

1041
01:17:43.205 --> 01:17:44.844
I told you. Matt.

1042
01:17:44.844 --> 01:17:47.781
You’re not as smart
as you think.

1043
01:17:49.684 --> 01:17:51.851
- Jesus Christ.

1044
01:17:51.851 --> 01:17:55.624
Well.
not quite water into wine.

1045
01:17:55.624 --> 01:17:59.628
but I did just manage
to turn a few bodies

1046
01:17:59.628 --> 01:18:02.026
into 208 million euros.

1047
01:18:06.228 --> 01:18:07.999
I...

1048
01:18:08.604 --> 01:18:11.970
I watched you die
in that explosion.

1049
01:18:11.970 --> 01:18:16.777
Misdirection is at the heart
of all great magic tricks.

1050
01:18:16.777 --> 01:18:19.142
I just needed
a little distraction.

1051
01:18:19.142 --> 01:18:22.981
Thankfully.
German trains run on time.

1052
01:18:24.554 --> 01:18:27.821
You know. that last blast
had a little more kick

1053
01:18:27.821 --> 01:18:29.559
than I expected.

1054
01:18:29.559 --> 01:18:31.759
But with all that money...

1055
01:18:33.728 --> 01:18:36.896
I’ll just get myself
a new face.

1056
01:18:37.666 --> 01:18:40.537
You did this all for money?

1057
01:18:40.537 --> 01:18:41.538
Survival.

1058
01:18:41.538 --> 01:18:44.673
Prison’s no place
for a man with my taste.

1059
01:18:46.004 --> 01:18:50.140
I gave you
18 years of my life.

1060
01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:53.242
- you son of a bitch!

1061
01:18:53.242 --> 01:18:57.752
This was all inevitable. Matt.
Don’t take it personally.

1062
01:18:57.752 --> 01:18:59.754
Inevitable?

1063
01:19:00.249 --> 01:19:03.890
If Cinderella’s slipper
fit so perfectly.

1064
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:06.728
then why did it fall off?

1065
01:19:08.895 --> 01:19:10.765
Huh?

1066
01:19:11.161 --> 01:19:14.571
Anders. what happened to you?

1067
01:19:14.571 --> 01:19:16.672
You know the business
we’re in. Matt.

1068
01:19:16.672 --> 01:19:21.204
It’s kill or be killed.
Your words.

1069
01:19:21.204 --> 01:19:24.207
Don’t go thinking
you’re different than me.

1070
01:19:24.207 --> 01:19:27.650
You’re the murderer.
not me.

1071
01:19:30.884 --> 01:19:32.886
You really think so?

1072
01:19:34.723 --> 01:19:35.757
Are you sure about that?

1073
01:19:35.757 --> 01:19:40.256
Anders. authorize liquidation.

1074
01:19:40.256 --> 01:19:41.224
or I will...

1075
01:19:41.224 --> 01:19:45.360
Authorize liquidation.
or I will...

1076
01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.362
kill you.

1077
01:19:47.703 --> 01:19:50.805
Okay. Okay.

1078
01:19:50.805 --> 01:19:52.741
I’m doing what you want.
all right?

1079
01:19:52.741 --> 01:19:56.371
I’m calling. Matt.
Just... hold on.

1080
01:19:56.371 --> 01:19:59.143
Do it.

1081
01:20:00.716 --> 01:20:04.852
Anders. I will kill you.

1082
01:20:09.791 --> 01:20:13.762
All sounds
pretty convincing to me.

1083
01:20:14.631 --> 01:20:19.361
The bombs. the money.
It all points to you.

1084
01:20:20.263 --> 01:20:22.969
You know what was
the easiest thing?

1085
01:20:22.969 --> 01:20:24.641
Setting up the bombs.

1086
01:20:25.708 --> 01:20:29.173
You know
there’s a bomb-making service
on the dark web?

1087
01:20:29.173 --> 01:20:30.779
If you pay them a premium.

1088
01:20:30.779 --> 01:20:34.244
they’ll even install it
in the car.

1089
01:20:35.784 --> 01:20:38.688
I’m five steps ahead
of everyone. Matt.

1090
01:20:38.688 --> 01:20:40.118
Make no mistake.

1091
01:20:40.118 --> 01:20:46.256
Now. if you’d be so kind
and complete the transaction.

1092
01:20:46.256 --> 01:20:48.665
Transfer the money. Matt.

1093
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:54.671
The minute you try to withdraw
one cent of that money.

1094
01:20:54.671 --> 01:20:56.871
they’ll know you’re alive.

1095
01:20:57.003 --> 01:20:58.873
It’s in a crypto account.

1096
01:20:58.873 --> 01:21:00.677
Untraceable. Impregnable.

1097
01:21:00.677 --> 01:21:01.975
You really think
I haven’t thought

1098
01:21:01.975 --> 01:21:05.407
of every single
possible permutation?

1099
01:21:06.276 --> 01:21:09.785
When your kids
got in the car this morning.

1100
01:21:09.785 --> 01:21:11.413
do you think I panicked?

1101
01:21:11.413 --> 01:21:14.416
The one day that you decide
to be a good daddy

1102
01:21:14.416 --> 01:21:17.892
and drive your kids
to school? No.

1103
01:21:17.892 --> 01:21:21.060
I adapted. I overcame.

1104
01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:22.292
Just like I did
when Pils Kroger

1105
01:21:22.292 --> 01:21:25.295
was going to pull the rug
out from under us.

1106
01:21:25.295 --> 01:21:28.166
He was going to destroy us.

1107
01:21:28.166 --> 01:21:29.398
I wasn’t gonna
let that happen.

1108
01:21:29.398 --> 01:21:34.271
He found out
you were siphoning money
from the offshore account.

1109
01:21:34.271 --> 01:21:38.011
The FCA doesn’t look kindly
on embezzlement.

1110
01:21:38.011 --> 01:21:39.815
He...

1111
01:21:39.815 --> 01:21:42.818
he did nothing to you.

1112
01:21:43.082 --> 01:21:47.922
And what did you do
when you found out? Hmm?

1113
01:21:48.725 --> 01:21:49.792
You did nothing.

1114
01:21:49.792 --> 01:21:54.456
- You looked the other way.
- I didn’t know
what you were doing.

1115
01:21:54.456 --> 01:21:56.733
Don’t be naive!

1116
01:21:56.931 --> 01:21:58.768
It’s always been about
the bottom line for us.

1117
01:21:58.768 --> 01:22:02.068
Bullshit! Everything I did
was above board.

1118
01:22:02.068 --> 01:22:04.939
You really do think
you’re different. don’t you?

1119
01:22:04.939 --> 01:22:07.810
At least I accept who I am.

1120
01:22:07.810 --> 01:22:10.307
You just lie to yourself
every day.

1121
01:22:10.307 --> 01:22:12.342
You just let it
eat away at you

1122
01:22:12.342 --> 01:22:16.115
until your own family
doesn’t recognize you.

1123
01:22:16.115 --> 01:22:18.755
I’m not surprised
Heather wants to leave you.

1124
01:22:18.755 --> 01:22:22.253
I’m just surprised
it took this long to do it.

1125
01:22:22.253 --> 01:22:26.961
Now stop wasting time.
Call the bank!

1126
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:31.999
I said call the bank.
This is your last chance.

1127
01:22:34.331 --> 01:22:36.938
I said call them.

1128
01:22:41.371 --> 01:22:43.208
Call them!

1129
01:22:45.342 --> 01:22:49.016
There’s one thing
you didn’t think of. Anders.

1130
01:22:49.918 --> 01:22:56.188
What a man will do
when he’s got nothing to lose.

1131
01:23:12.501 --> 01:23:13.909
Pull over. Matt.

1132
01:23:13.909 --> 01:23:15.944
Stop!

1133
01:23:15.944 --> 01:23:17.880
- Stop!
- No. no.

1134
01:23:17.880 --> 01:23:19.244
- I said stop!
- No.

1135
01:23:19.244 --> 01:23:21.015
Pull over
or I’ll kill us both!

1136
01:23:21.015 --> 01:23:23.886
I’m sorry.
I’m sorry. Heather.

1137
01:23:23.886 --> 01:23:25.448
- Pull over!

1138
01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:06.357
Come here. Come here.

1139
01:25:55.202 --> 01:25:57.039
The city
woke up to an explosion

1140
01:25:57.039 --> 01:25:59.503
- in Tiergarten this morning.
By the time it was over...

1141
01:25:59.503 --> 01:26:03.144
...a total
of four bombs rocked the city
in as many hours.

1142
01:26:03.144 --> 01:26:04.607
Initially thought to be
a terrorist...

1143
01:26:04.607 --> 01:26:06.477
...the elaborate
money heist

1144
01:26:06.477 --> 01:26:08.380
involved Nanite Capital’s
CEO Anders Muller.

1145
01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:11.350
The money was to be
transferred through crypto
accounts to avoid detection.

1146
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:14.353
Now a new
development regarding
all the demonstrations...

1147
01:26:14.353 --> 01:26:16.388
Nanite Capital
executive Matt Turner...

1148
01:26:16.388 --> 01:26:20.722
...working
in conjunction with Europol.
were quick to respond.
