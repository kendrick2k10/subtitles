00:02:33.444 --> 00:02:35.530
- I don't hear from
you for six months

4
00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.907
and out of the blue you call
and tell me to pick you up

5
00:02:37.907 --> 00:02:38.741
at nine o'clock.

6
00:02:42.912 --> 00:02:46.207
- That bird has been
making that nest

7
00:02:46.207 --> 00:02:47.208
for like.

8
00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:49.711
three months.

9
00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:53.298
Just motoring along.

10
00:02:58.303 --> 00:02:59.971
- Geez. I love this view.

11
00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:02.223
Pure L.A..

12
00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:09.397
- That's why I live here.

13
00:03:13.484 --> 00:03:16.446
- Tell me to pick you up at
nine a.m.. you goin' somewhere?

14
00:03:23.411 --> 00:03:24.245
- Yeah.

15
00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:26.581
We're going somewhere.

16
00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.604
What the hell is this?

17
00:03:49.604 --> 00:03:50.855
- It's an Audi.

18
00:03:50.855 --> 00:03:52.482
Don't give me any shit. Roxy.

19
00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:56.611
- You're a Jew.
driving an German vehicle.

20
00:03:56.611 --> 00:03:57.445
Excellent.

21
00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:00.448
- Welcome to
the new world order.

22
00:04:42.824 --> 00:04:44.325
- So the game is
in the bag. right.

23
00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.660
There's 20 seconds left.

24
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.537
All they gotta do
is take a knee.

25
00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:50.373
And they fumble the snap.
the guy runs it 80 yards

26
00:04:50.373 --> 00:04:53.084
for a touchdown.
cost me 250 bucks!

27
00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:56.671
Hey. how was your trip?

28
00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:57.755
- It was fine.

29
00:04:57.755 --> 00:04:58.548
- You came alone?

30
00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:00.675
- Yeah. I came alone.

31
00:05:00.675 --> 00:05:03.344
I guess it's better
than not coming at all.

32
00:05:05.513 --> 00:05:06.848
- You made a wise choice.

33
00:05:08.516 --> 00:05:11.352
Pete says you're
something special.

34
00:05:11.352 --> 00:05:14.772
I've heard that the demo
is really remarkable.

35
00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:17.692
You wrote the songs?

36
00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:20.194
- Yeah. I wrote the
songs. but my band.

37
00:05:20.194 --> 00:05:22.697
- Nia. I've been doing
this a long time.

38
00:05:22.697 --> 00:05:24.532
I know the goods.

39
00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:27.201
You're the good. they're not.

40
00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:30.872
Loyalty's cool. but these guys
are only gonna drag you down.

41
00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.249
Even Tom Petty
dropped the Mud Hens

42
00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:35.209
and look what happened
with "Damn the Torpedoes".

43
00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:37.545
Everybody made bank on that one.

44
00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:40.923
Come on. this isn't
a loyalty thing.

45
00:05:40.923 --> 00:05:42.216
This is business.

46
00:05:42.216 --> 00:05:44.886
- Seger didn't drop
the Silver Bullet Band.

47
00:05:44.886 --> 00:05:48.806
- Yeah. and Bob sells a million
copies in Detroit alone.

48
00:05:48.806 --> 00:05:52.060
And Nugent dumped the Amboy
Dukes. blah. blah. blah.

49
00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.729
We could go on
about this all day.

50
00:05:54.729 --> 00:05:56.898
Or we can get to brass tacks.

51
00:05:56.898 --> 00:05:57.732
You.

52
00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:02.070
You're the rising star
here. they're not.

53
00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:06.157
- Do you want to change me?

54
00:06:08.242 --> 00:06:10.953
Balls to the wall.
tits to the wind.

55
00:06:10.953 --> 00:06:14.749
Marshall stack vibrator
girl's best friend.

56
00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.418
- Hey. we wouldn't
have it any other way.

57
00:06:18.336 --> 00:06:21.005
But. there is one thing

58
00:06:21.005 --> 00:06:23.091
that's gonna have to change.

59
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:24.258
- It's starting already.

60
00:06:26.427 --> 00:06:27.303
What. what is it?

61
00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:31.265
- You have to have a name
that fits your profession.

62
00:06:31.265 --> 00:06:33.601
You're a solo act now.

63
00:06:33.601 --> 00:06:38.606
Nia Papachristos serves up lamb
and flaming cheese.

64
00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:40.608
Not rock and roll.

65
00:06:42.443 --> 00:06:44.445
- Why don't you give me a name?

66
00:06:44.445 --> 00:06:45.613
- I already have.

67
00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:49.951
Roxy Starr.

68
00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:11.532
- Roxy!

69
00:08:11.532 --> 00:08:13.034
- Who the hell are you?

70
00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.869
- I'm Lance. your audio tech.

71
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:16.370
- Well Lance. my audio
tech. what's it gonna take

72
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:18.039
for you do your job tonight?

73
00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:19.707
- What?

74
00:08:19.707 --> 00:08:20.875
- Do you need some tits?

75
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:25.713
And don't even think you're
gonna get to see the real goods.

76
00:08:25.713 --> 00:08:29.217
You got a long way to go
before that Mr. Audio Tech.

77
00:08:38.726 --> 00:08:40.561
- What the hell was that?

78
00:08:40.561 --> 00:08:42.563
- I'm trying the best show
possible. who the fuck was that?

79
00:08:42.563 --> 00:08:44.232
- The owner's son!

80
00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:46.609
And I don't even
know if he's 18.

81
00:08:46.609 --> 00:08:47.902
Dammit!

82
00:08:47.902 --> 00:08:50.071
You'll probably never
play this strip again!

83
00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:51.989
- Who fucking cares!

84
00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:54.325
I want to go on
the road. arenas.

85
00:08:54.325 --> 00:08:56.619
I've got a single
that's getting air play.

86
00:08:56.619 --> 00:08:58.788
an album that seems
to be selling.

87
00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.623
only I'm not seeing any money!

88
00:09:00.623 --> 00:09:02.750
- Well. we have to pay
back the investors.

89
00:09:04.001 --> 00:09:07.255
Listen. when the time
is right for the arenas

90
00:09:07.255 --> 00:09:09.674
I will let you know.
but it's not right now!

91
00:09:11.592 --> 00:09:14.929
The people need to know
if you're the real deal.

92
00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:17.807
- Oh yeah.

93
00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:55.970
- I can write you a
prescription for the nausea.

94
00:09:57.346 --> 00:09:59.473
Medical marijuana seems to--

95
00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:02.977
What's funny?

96
00:10:02.977 --> 00:10:05.479
- I'm a fucking rock star.
I know where to get weed.

97
00:10:12.153 --> 00:10:13.154
- Fair enough.

98
00:10:22.496 --> 00:10:23.331
Okay.

99
00:10:26.334 --> 00:10:27.168
- Okay.

100
00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:39.388
- I know of a good
support group.

101
00:10:41.223 --> 00:10:43.184
And you're going to
need hospice at some--

102
00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:43.934
- Now Doc.

103
00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:47.355
don't fuck up this
beautiful moment.

104
00:10:48.689 --> 00:10:49.523
- Gotcha.

105
00:10:52.693 --> 00:10:55.404
If there's anything I can do.

106
00:10:58.366 --> 00:10:59.909
- Well. if you want to break

107
00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:03.871
the doctor patient
relationship thing. I'm game.

108
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:06.624
- Goodbye. Roxy.

109
00:11:22.890 --> 00:11:25.434
- How come you never talked
me into getting one of these?

110
00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.562
- Well. Roger Daltry
said if it flies.

111
00:11:28.562 --> 00:11:30.940
floats or fucks rent it.

112
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.110
- You don't know Roger Daltry.

113
00:11:35.569 --> 00:11:38.572
- I didn't say I did. I
read it in "Rolling Stone".

114
00:11:40.157 --> 00:11:43.285
- Of course you did.

115
00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:44.245
- Why is that funny?

116
00:11:47.415 --> 00:11:48.749
- 'Cause Roger Daltry said.

117
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.460
You quote Roger Daltry.

118
00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:55.965
- How you doin' Roxy?

119
00:11:57.675 --> 00:11:58.467
- I'm okay.

120
00:12:01.846 --> 00:12:03.973
- Take a nap. try to rest.
- Okay.

121
00:12:28.622 --> 00:12:31.792
- Show time. Rox.
- Let's do it.

122
00:12:33.544 --> 00:12:36.464
Here we are. home sweet home.

123
00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:37.798
- Your home. not mine. honey.

124
00:12:37.798 --> 00:12:39.842
- What do you even
know about home towns?

125
00:12:39.842 --> 00:12:43.137
- You're from Encino
and please don't bitch

126
00:12:43.137 --> 00:12:45.055
about not being able
to find a good deli.

127
00:12:48.809 --> 00:12:50.144
Are you kidding me?

128
00:12:51.312 --> 00:12:55.149
This is a Honda and
a minivan to boot.

129
00:12:55.149 --> 00:12:58.319
Jeez. this is Michigan. I
can't be seen in a Honda.

130
00:12:58.319 --> 00:12:59.528
- It's the only car
that was available.

131
00:12:59.528 --> 00:13:01.655
Maybe you could buy
a new one tomorrow.

132
00:13:01.655 --> 00:13:03.991
- What the fuck am I
gonna do with a new car?

133
00:13:05.034 --> 00:13:07.077
Can I smoke in the car?

134
00:13:07.077 --> 00:13:07.995
- No. no smoking.

135
00:13:07.995 --> 00:13:08.996
- Why not?

136
00:13:08.996 --> 00:13:10.164
- Because I'm in the car.

137
00:13:12.833 --> 00:13:16.003
- Turn on the car and let me
throw these out the window.

138
00:14:22.444 --> 00:14:24.572
- There she is man. go ask her.

139
00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:26.073
- She's definitely
got some pipes.

140
00:14:26.073 --> 00:14:28.325
- How do you know. she
was in choir for a moment.

141
00:14:28.325 --> 00:14:30.077
- It was a hell of a moment.

142
00:14:30.077 --> 00:14:31.662
- I mean. she's cool
and everything. but
she's a wild one.

143
00:14:31.662 --> 00:14:33.247
- That's what I like.

144
00:14:33.247 --> 00:14:35.499
And ex-choir girl during the
day and a wild one at night.

145
00:14:35.499 --> 00:14:37.126
The education I could give her.

146
00:14:37.126 --> 00:14:38.627
- You couldn't handle that.

147
00:14:38.627 --> 00:14:41.297
- That's the one thing I
know is that I'm way past

148
00:14:41.297 --> 00:14:42.756
the handling myself stage.

149
00:14:42.756 --> 00:14:44.466
- You're so full of
shit man. you know that?

150
00:14:44.466 --> 00:14:46.176
- Perhaps I should
go talk to her.

151
00:14:47.261 --> 00:14:48.929
Sorry.

152
00:14:48.929 --> 00:14:49.763
Hey Nia.

153
00:14:50.764 --> 00:14:51.599
- Hey. what's up?

154
00:14:54.768 --> 00:14:56.520
- The guys were wondering--
- Yeah?

155
00:14:57.688 --> 00:15:00.608
- Well. I don't know
if you'd want to.

156
00:15:00.608 --> 00:15:03.444
- I'm only 17. I'm
not experienced enough

157
00:15:03.444 --> 00:15:04.445
to take all of you.

158
00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:05.696
Give me a few years.

159
00:15:05.696 --> 00:15:08.115
- No. that's not what I meant.

160
00:15:08.115 --> 00:15:09.950
- You and Christine
still going out?

161
00:15:11.327 --> 00:15:13.037
- Yeah. yeah. that's not
what I wanted to tell you.

162
00:15:13.037 --> 00:15:14.371
I wanted ask you if...

163
00:15:14.371 --> 00:15:16.665
- What did you want to ask me?

164
00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:21.170
- Don't make this so damn hard.

165
00:15:21.170 --> 00:15:22.713
- What. the words or your dick?

166
00:15:23.964 --> 00:15:25.674
- My dick obviously.

167
00:15:27.134 --> 00:15:29.720
As you might know. the guys
and I. we've got a band

168
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.972
and we thought that if
we had a gal in the group

169
00:15:31.972 --> 00:15:34.516
it would help out our playlist.

170
00:15:34.516 --> 00:15:36.352
So. what do you think?

171
00:15:37.978 --> 00:15:40.981
- I think if you're
serious give me a call.

172
00:15:42.149 --> 00:15:42.983
- I'm serious.

173
00:15:45.152 --> 00:15:46.737
Hey!

174
00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:48.864
Come to my dad's
garage tomorrow night.

175
00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:51.825
We've got a rehearsal
and you can check us out.

176
00:15:57.498 --> 00:15:59.416
- Like you're checking
me out right now?

177
00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:04.004
- Rox. come
on. it's getting late.

178
00:16:04.004 --> 00:16:04.838
Let's go!

179
00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:21.021
- That's where it all started.

180
00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:25.526
Man. I remember that
like it was yesterday.

181
00:16:29.196 --> 00:16:30.531
- All right!

182
00:16:33.575 --> 00:16:36.078
- Hey. so what'd you think?

183
00:16:37.204 --> 00:16:38.872
- It's all right.

184
00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:39.873
Who wrote the song?

185
00:16:41.542 --> 00:16:42.751
- I did.

186
00:16:42.751 --> 00:16:45.754
- All right. well what
do you want from me?

187
00:16:45.754 --> 00:16:48.465
- I don't know. a
little feedback maybe.

188
00:16:49.591 --> 00:16:52.302
- It's all right.
it's nothing special.

189
00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:57.725
You guys can play. you just
have to let yourselves go.

190
00:16:57.725 --> 00:16:59.601
- Wow. thank you for your time.

191
00:16:59.601 --> 00:17:00.936
I think it sounded
pretty damn good!

192
00:17:00.936 --> 00:17:02.146
- All right. think
what you want.

193
00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:04.732
Tommy asked for my
opinion and I gave it.

194
00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:05.899
- Hey. where you goin?

195
00:17:07.276 --> 00:17:11.405
Look yeah. we do a lot of
covers but we're serious

196
00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:14.241
about this and we want
to be a working band.

197
00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:15.284
We feel like we can with you.

198
00:17:15.284 --> 00:17:16.744
- Maybe we don't need her.

199
00:17:16.744 --> 00:17:18.287
We didn't even hear her sing.

200
00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:19.663
Chicks don't lead
in the rock world.

201
00:17:19.663 --> 00:17:21.248
- Give me that lyric sheet.

202
00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:25.085
- Dutch. up the tempo
on that opening lick.

203
00:17:25.085 --> 00:17:26.754
Sounds like you're
playing a dirge.

204
00:17:26.754 --> 00:17:28.505
Put down the acoustic
and pick up the electric.

205
00:17:28.505 --> 00:17:31.592
Cecil. you and Bobby are
the anchors. keep it tight.

206
00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:33.260
Don't shoot your
wad on this tune.

207
00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.095
Everything needs to
pop on this tune.

208
00:17:36.263 --> 00:17:38.766
Paps you fill. this
a guitar driven tune.

209
00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:40.684
You just fill.

210
00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:43.353
- You like to grace
us with your vocals?

211
00:17:45.939 --> 00:17:47.024
- I'll give it a crack.

212
00:17:48.609 --> 00:17:49.943
Remember. I'm just a chick.

213
00:18:16.136 --> 00:18:18.889
- It's not a bad
hotel for Kalamazoo.

214
00:18:18.889 --> 00:18:21.058
Was it here when you were here?

215
00:18:21.058 --> 00:18:23.143
- I don't remember it.

216
00:18:23.143 --> 00:18:26.230
Course I wouldn't have had
the money to stay here anyway.

217
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:29.817
- Roxy. Roxy Starr?

218
00:18:29.817 --> 00:18:31.151
What are you doing in Kalamazoo?

219
00:18:31.151 --> 00:18:32.361
You got a show coming up?

220
00:18:33.862 --> 00:18:36.990
You know. you used to be
such a sexy little thing

221
00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:39.576
and I used to be
your biggest fan.

222
00:18:39.576 --> 00:18:43.497
Listen. can I get an
autograph for my girlfriend?

223
00:18:43.497 --> 00:18:45.707
- How come you don't
want my autograph?

224
00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:47.501
Not that sexy for you now?

225
00:18:48.836 --> 00:18:51.338
Go on. hit the road. sheesh.

226
00:18:51.338 --> 00:18:53.006
And if you're such a big fan.

227
00:18:53.006 --> 00:18:55.509
you know I'm from
Kalamazoo. you shit head.

228
00:18:58.428 --> 00:19:00.556
You know. I wouldn't even
sign your dick for ya.

229
00:19:00.556 --> 00:19:02.558
Wouldn't give me enough
room to write on.

230
00:19:26.206 --> 00:19:28.375
- Is there anything
else I can get for you?

231
00:19:34.089 --> 00:19:35.465
- Come here.

232
00:19:54.067 --> 00:19:54.902
Did you like that?

233
00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:56.987
- Yes. I did.

234
00:20:03.243 --> 00:20:04.745
- You run along. little man.

235
00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.290
It's the only tip
you're getting today.

236
00:20:09.291 --> 00:20:11.418
I mean. unless you're from NASA.

237
00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:14.087
- I don't get it.

238
00:20:16.089 --> 00:20:17.591
- Can you send me to the moon?

239
00:20:19.134 --> 00:20:20.260
- I still don't get it.

240
00:20:24.264 --> 00:20:26.266
- Are in college?

241
00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:27.434
- Yes. I am.

242
00:20:29.019 --> 00:20:32.439
- Well. you're certainly
not ready for graduation.

243
00:20:35.859 --> 00:20:40.364
Do me a favor. you
stay in college.

244
00:20:42.282 --> 00:20:46.119
You call me when you get out.

245
00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:49.623
- Yeah. yeah. I'll call you.

246
00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:53.877
Excuse me.

247
00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:04.638
- Really. Rox.

248
00:21:06.056 --> 00:21:08.350
The first thing to do on your
bucket list is a bell hop?

249
00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:11.728
- Carl.

250
00:21:11.728 --> 00:21:13.146
He's not ready for the majors.

251
00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.857
Neither am I anymore.

252
00:21:15.857 --> 00:21:19.319
- So. what is on the
agenda for this afternoon?

253
00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:21.571
I love watching you
navigate unchartered waters.

254
00:21:21.571 --> 00:21:23.365
- Well no. they're chartered.

255
00:21:25.158 --> 00:21:27.536
Anyway. we have to
make another stop.

256
00:21:27.536 --> 00:21:29.162
- Wherever you leading is fine.

257
00:21:31.206 --> 00:21:32.541
I better change my clothes.

258
00:21:33.875 --> 00:21:36.336
- Black. not so good.

259
00:21:36.336 --> 00:21:38.839
- You slut. keep
your underwear on.

260
00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.361
- The grace of
our Lord Jesus Christ

261
00:22:01.361 --> 00:22:04.448
and the love of God the father.

262
00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:07.200
and the communion of holy
spirit be with you all

263
00:22:08.535 --> 00:22:10.245
and with your spirit.

264
00:22:12.289 --> 00:22:16.043
Let us bow our heads unto
the Lord. to you Lord.

265
00:22:24.384 --> 00:22:26.720
- It's good to see you. Mom.

266
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.472
This is my manager.
Carl Weinstein.

267
00:22:35.729 --> 00:22:39.608
Carl's Jewish. so I told him
not to kiss any of the icons.

268
00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:40.400
- Come on.

269
00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.739
- I can see the turnouts
haven't changed.

270
00:22:45.739 --> 00:22:48.158
- A lot of people turn
away this time of year.

271
00:22:48.158 --> 00:22:50.577
They only show up for
Christmas and Easter.

272
00:22:51.912 --> 00:22:54.122
- Same old. same old.
- Yeah. same old. same old.

273
00:22:59.753 --> 00:23:01.755
- Why haven't you
cashed my checks?

274
00:23:01.755 --> 00:23:03.673
You act like I'm
sending you blood money.

275
00:23:03.673 --> 00:23:05.759
- Roxy. this isn't
a place for that.

276
00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:09.596
- Have you forgotten where you
are and where you come from?

277
00:23:14.768 --> 00:23:16.937
- No. I haven't forgotten.

278
00:23:23.443 --> 00:23:24.653
- Where we goin' Rox?

279
00:23:24.653 --> 00:23:26.947
- I'm not going
anywhere. stay here.

280
00:23:26.947 --> 00:23:28.615
- What are gonna do?

281
00:23:28.615 --> 00:23:31.118
- I'm just gonna go do
something real quick.

282
00:23:31.118 --> 00:23:33.203
- You're gonna get in trouble.

283
00:25:04.544 --> 00:25:05.921
Nice to meet you.

284
00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:13.053
- Aren't you staying
for coffee hour?

285
00:25:13.053 --> 00:25:14.930
- Oh. you ruined
coffee hour for me.

286
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:16.765
- How did I ruin coffee hour?

287
00:25:16.765 --> 00:25:20.393
Mom. just go downstairs.
have some coffee.

288
00:25:20.393 --> 00:25:23.563
- I can't face my
friends in silence.

289
00:25:23.563 --> 00:25:25.273
- What are you
talking about. in silence?

290
00:25:25.273 --> 00:25:27.400
- The silence of
condescending looks

291
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.071
because I raised
such a selfish child.

292
00:25:31.071 --> 00:25:33.281
- I sent you checks. what
the hell do you mean?

293
00:25:33.281 --> 00:25:34.741
- Rox. take it easy. come on.

294
00:25:34.741 --> 00:25:38.286
- It's not about the checks.
it's about the actions.

295
00:25:38.286 --> 00:25:41.456
Your actions in life paved
the way for eternity.

296
00:25:41.456 --> 00:25:42.582
You understand?

297
00:25:44.251 --> 00:25:45.669
Nia. are you all right?

298
00:25:49.506 --> 00:25:52.425
- Mom. I don't know
where to begin.

299
00:25:52.425 --> 00:25:54.928
- Roxy. let's just sit
down. forget this. come on.

300
00:25:56.096 --> 00:25:57.973
- You're not pregnant
again. are you?

301
00:25:59.516 --> 00:26:01.601
- I don't have energy for this.

302
00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:03.436
Can I come over for
dinner some night?

303
00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:06.982
- Nia. I go out a lot.

304
00:26:06.982 --> 00:26:10.610
- Come on. Mom. one
last meal with you?

305
00:26:14.030 --> 00:26:16.116
- Will you be around
a week from Friday?

306
00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:19.119
- I can if you want me to be.

307
00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:20.662
- Be at the house
at three o'clock.

308
00:26:20.662 --> 00:26:21.955
I'll set a place for you.

309
00:26:26.626 --> 00:26:29.004
- Roxy. are you all right?

310
00:26:29.004 --> 00:26:29.838
- Yeah.

311
00:26:30.672 --> 00:26:32.632
Everything's all right.

312
00:26:32.632 --> 00:26:34.801
Anyway. we have to make
another stop. okay?

313
00:26:37.053 --> 00:26:37.887
- Sure.

314
00:26:56.698 --> 00:26:58.033
- Hey.
- Hi babe.

315
00:26:59.075 --> 00:27:01.244
- Hey. how was Sunday school?

316
00:27:01.244 --> 00:27:02.370
- It was fine.

317
00:27:04.247 --> 00:27:05.415
- What'd you learn?

318
00:27:05.415 --> 00:27:06.916
- Stuff.

319
00:27:06.916 --> 00:27:11.004
- Oh. that's very informative.
very informative young man.

320
00:27:12.339 --> 00:27:13.882
- Hey. how'd your day go today?

321
00:27:14.758 --> 00:27:17.761
- Oh my God. right!

322
00:27:21.264 --> 00:27:23.099
- Is there anything
you want to tell me?

323
00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.101
- Like what?

324
00:27:26.019 --> 00:27:28.021
- I don't know.

325
00:27:28.021 --> 00:27:30.190
any significance to today?

326
00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:36.029
- The date is the
17th. right. 17th.

327
00:27:36.029 --> 00:27:38.198
- Okay. so it's the 17th

328
00:27:38.198 --> 00:27:41.368
and on the 17th of this
month we celebrate?

329
00:27:42.786 --> 00:27:46.748
- If it was March. it'd be
St. Patrick's day. but. 17th?

330
00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:49.542
- Don't tell me you forgot.

331
00:27:51.044 --> 00:27:52.545
This is our big one.

332
00:27:52.545 --> 00:27:55.548
We've been married for 15
years. how can you forget?

333
00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:57.926
Tommy.

334
00:27:59.886 --> 00:28:00.720
- Oh my God.

335
00:28:02.138 --> 00:28:05.809
- I spent all day cooking and
figure out the perfect meal

336
00:28:05.809 --> 00:28:08.895
and not to mention the time
and the effort I put in to

337
00:28:08.895 --> 00:28:11.940
finding the right gift and.

338
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.609
I just don't know
why put up with you.

339
00:28:14.609 --> 00:28:16.403
Here you go sweetie.

340
00:28:16.403 --> 00:28:18.405
- For you. my lady.
- What?

341
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.957
It's a fishing pole.
- Right!

342
00:28:28.957 --> 00:28:31.251
Brand new. carbon
fiber. state of the art.

343
00:28:34.754 --> 00:28:35.755
- You're kidding. right?

344
00:28:36.673 --> 00:28:37.674
- You don't like it?

345
00:28:40.427 --> 00:28:44.013
- Tommy. it's just I don't fish.

346
00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.641
- I thought you
could learn. right.

347
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:51.604
I'm sorry. I just thought
you could use this

348
00:28:51.604 --> 00:28:53.606
as a lure too. I guess.

349
00:28:57.277 --> 00:29:00.530
- You.

350
00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:01.364
Oh!

351
00:29:03.533 --> 00:29:04.617
Oh. it's beautiful!

352
00:29:06.453 --> 00:29:08.997
- Happy anniversary.
- Thank you so much.

353
00:29:12.208 --> 00:29:13.042
Thank you.

354
00:29:14.169 --> 00:29:15.211
I was so worried.

355
00:29:16.129 --> 00:29:17.338
- I'd never forget.

356
00:29:17.338 --> 00:29:19.132
- All right. now it's
your turn. sit down.

357
00:29:19.132 --> 00:29:21.634
- Oh God.
- Sit down. sit down.

358
00:29:21.634 --> 00:29:23.887
Okay. close your eyes. you too.

359
00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.307
- You too?
- Yeah.

360
00:29:27.307 --> 00:29:28.641
Are they closed?
- Yes.

361
00:29:30.477 --> 00:29:31.478
- All right.

362
00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:35.148
Okay. open 'em.

363
00:29:39.402 --> 00:29:40.320
- Oh my God.

364
00:29:41.988 --> 00:29:46.326
Sweetheart. we do not
have the money for this.

365
00:29:47.660 --> 00:29:48.495
- Do you like it?

366
00:29:49.913 --> 00:29:51.873
The guys at the store said
that you had your eye on it.

367
00:29:51.873 --> 00:29:53.833
- I love it. I just...

368
00:29:55.710 --> 00:29:58.171
I haven't played anything
like this in 25 years.

369
00:30:00.256 --> 00:30:03.593
- We are born to
follow our dreams.

370
00:30:03.593 --> 00:30:05.887
You have to set the
example for our son.

371
00:30:07.555 --> 00:30:09.349
When we stop
following our dreams.

372
00:30:11.059 --> 00:30:13.937
I don't know. we're
just taking up space.

373
00:30:18.107 --> 00:30:19.609
- I get it.

374
00:30:19.609 --> 00:30:21.194
I've been walking around this
house like a horse's ass.

375
00:30:21.194 --> 00:30:22.695
- Something like that.

376
00:30:23.863 --> 00:30:26.074
- Thank you. I love it.

377
00:30:26.074 --> 00:30:27.033
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

378
00:30:29.702 --> 00:30:30.537
- I'm so glad!

379
00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:34.249
- This is so cool!

380
00:30:34.249 --> 00:30:36.042
Can you teach me how
to play one of these?

381
00:30:37.544 --> 00:30:39.295
- Yeah. yeah. some time.

382
00:30:40.755 --> 00:30:43.216
But let's maybe play some
football right now. huh.

383
00:30:43.216 --> 00:30:43.967
what do you think?

384
00:30:43.967 --> 00:30:45.218
We have time?

385
00:30:45.218 --> 00:30:46.219
- Yeah. dinner won't
be ready for an hour.

386
00:30:46.219 --> 00:30:47.387
You two go.

387
00:30:47.387 --> 00:30:48.221
- Boom.

388
00:30:50.557 --> 00:30:51.975
Thank you.
- Yeah.

389
00:31:06.573 --> 00:31:08.992
- We heard there was a pure
romance party in the area

390
00:31:08.992 --> 00:31:11.286
so we decided to stop by.

391
00:31:12.829 --> 00:31:16.499
- Nia. what are you doing here?

392
00:31:16.499 --> 00:31:17.917
- Just wanted to say hi.

393
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:21.254
Can we come in?

394
00:31:22.672 --> 00:31:23.506
- Sure.

395
00:31:25.592 --> 00:31:27.302
- Nice place. Chris!

396
00:31:30.471 --> 00:31:32.265
- You've been here before. Nia.

397
00:31:32.265 --> 00:31:34.934
- Oh. I just. I don't
remember it being so cute!

398
00:31:36.102 --> 00:31:38.521
- We do what we can
with what we have.

399
00:31:38.521 --> 00:31:40.356
- Well. you look good.

400
00:31:42.942 --> 00:31:43.776
How are the boys?

401
00:31:45.153 --> 00:31:45.945
Are they here?

402
00:31:47.614 --> 00:31:49.032
- Yeah. they're great.

403
00:31:49.991 --> 00:31:52.327
They're out back. playing catch.

404
00:31:52.327 --> 00:31:53.202
- Can I see them?

405
00:31:54.537 --> 00:31:57.832
- Sure. you know. just
don't take too long.

406
00:31:57.832 --> 00:32:01.502
Today is our anniversary and
I'm making a special dinner.

407
00:32:01.502 --> 00:32:03.546
- Yeah. no. no. I won't.

408
00:32:05.965 --> 00:32:08.301
- I'm sorry. I should
have introduced myself.

409
00:32:08.301 --> 00:32:10.803
I'm Carl Weinstein.
Roxy's manager.

410
00:32:10.803 --> 00:32:13.306
- Hi. Christine Tucker.
nice to meet you.

411
00:32:13.306 --> 00:32:16.809
I am married to Tommy. the
guy you haven't met yet

412
00:32:16.809 --> 00:32:20.813
and actually. Nia should
have introduced us.

413
00:32:20.813 --> 00:32:21.814
Would you like a coffee?

414
00:32:21.814 --> 00:32:22.815
- That sounds great.

415
00:32:22.815 --> 00:32:24.317
- Okay. great.

416
00:32:24.317 --> 00:32:27.028
Why don't you have a seat.
because who know how long

417
00:32:27.028 --> 00:32:27.987
they're gonna take.

418
00:32:29.489 --> 00:32:31.824
- Great. but catch with your
hands. not your body. right.

419
00:32:31.824 --> 00:32:34.160
- I guess I'm just not that
good at using my hands.

420
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.662
- No!

421
00:32:35.662 --> 00:32:38.164
You're great and if you're
not. we'll make you a kicker.

422
00:32:48.508 --> 00:32:49.258
How are you?

423
00:32:51.719 --> 00:32:52.553
- Never better.

424
00:32:53.846 --> 00:32:55.431
- Dad. who's that?

425
00:32:57.266 --> 00:32:58.935
- This is your..

426
00:32:58.935 --> 00:33:01.020
I'm your Aunt Roxy. honey.

427
00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.023
I've come a long way
just to get a hug.

428
00:33:09.862 --> 00:33:11.197
- So. you're Nia's manager.

429
00:33:13.366 --> 00:33:14.450
- I'm Roxy's manager.

430
00:33:15.868 --> 00:33:17.704
- How long have you
been Nia's manager?

431
00:33:17.704 --> 00:33:20.039
- I've been managing
Roxy about 18 years now.

432
00:33:20.957 --> 00:33:21.791
- So that

433
00:33:24.043 --> 00:33:27.588
makes you part of
the abyss. then?

434
00:33:27.588 --> 00:33:29.090
- Excuse me?

435
00:33:29.090 --> 00:33:31.217
- The black cloud that's
been hanging over a bunch

436
00:33:31.217 --> 00:33:33.386
of our heads for
the last 30 years.

437
00:33:35.471 --> 00:33:37.890
- I'm sorry. I
don't quite follow.

438
00:33:37.890 --> 00:33:40.059
- No. you don't.

439
00:33:41.561 --> 00:33:43.396
- I don't know how to hold this.

440
00:33:43.396 --> 00:33:44.897
- Well. you just hold
it by the strings.

441
00:33:44.897 --> 00:33:48.234
near the back of the ball.
there you go. there you go.

442
00:33:54.073 --> 00:33:55.658
Nice. there you go!

443
00:34:01.247 --> 00:34:02.165
How are you doin'?

444
00:34:06.252 --> 00:34:07.253
- How's Johnny doin'?

445
00:34:09.088 --> 00:34:10.798
- He's great.

446
00:34:10.798 --> 00:34:13.176
He's got friends.
school's goin' well.

447
00:34:13.176 --> 00:34:15.636
- Teach him any guitar?
- Not yet.

448
00:34:16.846 --> 00:34:19.932
- Well. with his DNA. he
could be pretty badass.

449
00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:22.852
Does he have a guitar?

450
00:34:22.852 --> 00:34:24.145
- Not yet.

451
00:34:24.145 --> 00:34:25.438
Money's a little tight.

452
00:34:25.438 --> 00:34:27.607
- Wait. you been getting
my checks. haven't you?

453
00:34:27.607 --> 00:34:29.609
- Those are for Johnny's
college and beyond.

454
00:34:29.609 --> 00:34:31.277
- No. no you can have
some of that too.

455
00:34:31.277 --> 00:34:32.653
- No. we're fine.

456
00:34:32.653 --> 00:34:34.280
That is Johnny's money.

457
00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.032
We are fine. we will get by.

458
00:34:37.617 --> 00:34:42.288
You have given Christine
and me just everything

459
00:34:42.288 --> 00:34:43.456
by giving us Johnny.

460
00:34:48.211 --> 00:34:50.713
- Thanks for the
coffee. it's nice.

461
00:34:50.713 --> 00:34:53.132
- Since you been around
for the last 18 years then.

462
00:34:53.132 --> 00:34:55.968
I guess you know that Tommy
and I adopted Nia's child.

463
00:34:57.303 --> 00:34:59.639
- Well yeah. I know a
little about it. but that's

464
00:35:00.807 --> 00:35:02.141
its all personal.

465
00:35:02.141 --> 00:35:03.017
I'm professional.

466
00:35:04.393 --> 00:35:08.022
- That's supposed to remain
quiet. right. gotcha.

467
00:35:09.690 --> 00:35:13.569
- It's like I said. you know.
it's not my area of expertise.

468
00:35:14.737 --> 00:35:18.407
Personal versus
private. you know.

469
00:35:18.407 --> 00:35:20.660
I was never very good at
managing those two things

470
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:21.994
so I stay clear of it.

471
00:35:23.996 --> 00:35:26.999
- So Nia doesn't entrust
you with her intimates then?

472
00:35:26.999 --> 00:35:29.836
- Some yes. some no. but
this hits too close to home.

473
00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:34.173
- Have a child out there
looking for its dad?

474
00:35:35.383 --> 00:35:38.177
- No. not looking.

475
00:35:43.182 --> 00:35:44.684
Where did you meet Tommy?

476
00:35:45.726 --> 00:35:47.019
- I was always around.

477
00:35:49.689 --> 00:35:54.026
I was Tommy's
girlfriend. but I mean.

478
00:35:54.026 --> 00:35:58.030
he loved me but he
always had a soft spot

479
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.031
in his heart for Nia.

480
00:36:01.784 --> 00:36:06.789
As you know. Nia can
hold 75.000 or one

481
00:36:07.540 --> 00:36:08.541
in the palm of her hand.

482
00:36:22.555 --> 00:36:23.806
It's the one in the hand

483
00:36:23.806 --> 00:36:26.475
that I worry about a
little bit sometimes.

484
00:36:31.397 --> 00:36:33.232
- Hey big guy. come on in.
let's get washed up for dinner.

485
00:36:34.233 --> 00:36:35.067
Oh!

486
00:36:38.571 --> 00:36:41.741
I'd invite you to stay. but
it's actually our anniversary

487
00:36:41.741 --> 00:36:42.575
and I don't know how--

488
00:36:42.575 --> 00:36:44.744
- How welcome we'd be.

489
00:36:44.744 --> 00:36:45.912
No. no. I get it.

490
00:36:47.079 --> 00:36:48.581
I'm gonna be in
town for a while.

491
00:36:51.417 --> 00:36:52.501
Can you do me a favor?

492
00:36:53.961 --> 00:36:57.089
Get the guys together. I want
to see everybody before I go.

493
00:36:58.424 --> 00:37:00.426
- It's a pretty big favor.

494
00:37:00.426 --> 00:37:02.094
You know. they still
may not want to see ya.

495
00:37:02.094 --> 00:37:04.847
- Well. don't tell
'em what it's about.

496
00:37:06.766 --> 00:37:08.267
Just get 'em in the same room.

497
00:37:10.770 --> 00:37:13.022
I want to see everybody before.

498
00:37:13.022 --> 00:37:15.942
- Their last gig was at the
Barn Theater in Kalamazoo

499
00:37:17.109 --> 00:37:18.778
and it was for a
major record label

500
00:37:18.778 --> 00:37:21.781
and everybody was so excited.

501
00:37:21.781 --> 00:37:24.033
This was supposed to
be their big break

502
00:37:24.033 --> 00:37:29.038
and Nia became Roxy and
screwed them and left Tommy

503
00:37:29.038 --> 00:37:31.332
and the rest of the guys
twisting in the wind.

504
00:37:32.625 --> 00:37:35.378
- That's not how it works. okay.

505
00:37:35.378 --> 00:37:36.963
The record label--
- Hey Mom!

506
00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:38.297
- Yeah.

507
00:37:38.297 --> 00:37:39.799
- Dad and I were just
playing catch with Aunt Roxy.

508
00:37:39.799 --> 00:37:41.968
Why didn't you ever
tell me I had an aunt?

509
00:37:41.968 --> 00:37:44.512
- 'Cause she hasn't
been around for so long.

510
00:37:44.512 --> 00:37:45.721
it didn't come up.

511
00:37:46.847 --> 00:37:49.183
- Carl. this is Tommy.

512
00:37:49.183 --> 00:37:51.560
Tommy Tucker. Carl Weinstein.

513
00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:52.812
Carl's my manager.

514
00:37:52.812 --> 00:37:54.647
- Nice to meet you.

515
00:37:54.647 --> 00:37:59.026
- I'm sorry Chris. I didn't
mean to spoil your anniversary.

516
00:37:59.026 --> 00:37:59.986
Carl. we gotta go.

517
00:38:01.487 --> 00:38:03.489
- Thanks for the hospitality.

518
00:38:03.489 --> 00:38:05.157
- Let's go Carl.
they have a dinner.

519
00:38:05.157 --> 00:38:06.158
- She's out the door.

520
00:38:07.326 --> 00:38:10.329
Take care and thanks
for everything.

521
00:38:10.329 --> 00:38:11.664
- Yeah. you bet.

522
00:38:25.761 --> 00:38:30.558
- For someone who doesn't eat
much there's a lot in there.

523
00:38:30.558 --> 00:38:32.268
- Yeah. I've always
been a good puker.

524
00:38:35.771 --> 00:38:38.566
- You want some of that
medicinal marijuana now?

525
00:38:38.566 --> 00:38:39.442
- No. fuck no.

526
00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:47.116
It's times like
these I'm gonna miss.

527
00:38:48.909 --> 00:38:51.037
- What. the excessive vomiting?

528
00:38:52.371 --> 00:38:55.041
- No.

529
00:38:55.041 --> 00:38:55.875
The quiet.

530
00:39:02.882 --> 00:39:03.716
Back in the day.

531
00:39:06.635 --> 00:39:09.055
I could sit in a field.
bang out a couple songs

532
00:39:11.057 --> 00:39:12.725
and not have a
care in the world.

533
00:39:17.730 --> 00:39:18.606
But I'm lucky.

534
00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:22.902
I know when my time's coming.

535
00:39:24.236 --> 00:39:25.988
So I have a chance
to make it right.

536
00:39:27.156 --> 00:39:29.075
Can I make it right?

537
00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:31.410
- I don't know everything
you've done wrong.

538
00:39:31.410 --> 00:39:33.412
You haven't been
keeping me in the loop.

539
00:39:34.997 --> 00:39:35.831
- Eh. well I do.

540
00:39:40.002 --> 00:39:41.587
If I can get everything together

541
00:39:45.257 --> 00:39:48.344
I want to have one last
concert. here in Michigan.

542
00:39:49.428 --> 00:39:51.013
with all my old boys.

543
00:39:51.013 --> 00:39:52.306
One last hoorah.

544
00:39:53.766 --> 00:39:56.143
- Roxy. you told me I should
always be truthful with you.

545
00:39:58.771 --> 00:40:02.274
You've accomplished.

546
00:40:02.274 --> 00:40:04.610
you've created more
than any 10 people.

547
00:40:04.610 --> 00:40:07.363
You're the greatest rock and
roll performer I've ever seen.

548
00:40:07.363 --> 00:40:08.447
male or female.

549
00:40:09.949 --> 00:40:13.953
When you put on a show. it's
like. your hair's on fire.

550
00:40:15.329 --> 00:40:18.457
which is how rock and roll
should always be done. right.

551
00:40:20.459 --> 00:40:24.130
You change people. you
certainly changed me.

552
00:40:27.967 --> 00:40:32.388
But Rox. as talented as you are.

553
00:40:33.639 --> 00:40:35.641
wherever we go. there's
not a positive outcome.

554
00:40:37.143 --> 00:40:40.229
I know. I know I'm your fetch
and get it guy and that's cool

555
00:40:40.229 --> 00:40:44.400
if you include me. but you
leave me in someone's house.

556
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.402
knowing half the
story is bullshit.

557
00:40:51.991 --> 00:40:52.825
- I'm sorry.

558
00:40:56.996 --> 00:40:58.497
I owe this show to the boys

559
00:41:01.167 --> 00:41:03.669
and to you and to me.

560
00:41:07.923 --> 00:41:09.884
- Have I made any kind of dent?

561
00:41:14.013 --> 00:41:15.681
- Like a velvet sledgehammer.

562
00:41:20.519 --> 00:41:22.021
- Ready?

563
00:41:22.021 --> 00:41:22.855
- Let's go.

564
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:37.620
- I know when summer rolls
around. you'll be four-wheeling.

565
00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.079
having a lot of fun.

566
00:41:42.541 --> 00:41:45.878
- Excuse me.

567
00:41:45.878 --> 00:41:46.712
- Yeah. hey Tommy.

568
00:41:46.712 --> 00:41:48.088
- Yeah?
- Yeah?

569
00:41:48.088 --> 00:41:50.424
- Hey man long time no hear.
- Long time no talk.

570
00:41:50.424 --> 00:41:53.093
- Look. I was thinking
we get the band together.

571
00:41:53.093 --> 00:41:55.721
You know. just hang out. see
each other. it's been a while.

572
00:41:55.721 --> 00:41:58.057
Canal Cafe. Wednesday.
- This Wednesday?

573
00:41:58.057 --> 00:41:59.391
- Man. I can't.

574
00:41:59.391 --> 00:42:00.643
- I've got a date
this Wednesday.

575
00:42:00.643 --> 00:42:01.894
- Still your right
hand. I presume?

576
00:42:01.894 --> 00:42:03.395
- This isn't about
the money you owe me.

577
00:42:03.395 --> 00:42:04.730
- Who said anything
about sobriety?

578
00:42:04.730 --> 00:42:05.981
- What's on the menu?

579
00:42:05.981 --> 00:42:07.608
- I thought the lap
dances were on you.

580
00:42:07.608 --> 00:42:09.109
- Have they got a website?

581
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:10.319
- Yeah. it's cold.

582
00:42:10.319 --> 00:42:11.904
- Still married. huh?

583
00:42:11.904 --> 00:42:15.324
- Can you make it?
- Yeah. yeah I'm open.

584
00:42:15.324 --> 00:42:16.575
- Can you make it or no?

585
00:42:16.575 --> 00:42:17.743
- Maybe I can get her
momma to take her.

586
00:42:17.743 --> 00:42:19.745
- Okay. I'll be there.

587
00:42:19.745 --> 00:42:21.247
- What about my date?

588
00:42:21.247 --> 00:42:23.415
- Like I said. your right
hand is fine. bring her.

589
00:42:24.792 --> 00:42:26.669
- We've been sittin'
here for five minutes

590
00:42:26.669 --> 00:42:28.754
waiting for you to
make up your mind.

591
00:42:28.754 --> 00:42:30.256
Just place the god damn order!

592
00:42:30.256 --> 00:42:34.093
- Unlike you. I care about
what I put in my body.

593
00:42:34.093 --> 00:42:35.344
What kind of light
beer do you have?

594
00:42:35.344 --> 00:42:36.679
- Holy shit!

595
00:42:36.679 --> 00:42:38.973
I am going to punch
you in the throat!

596
00:42:38.973 --> 00:42:40.766
Would you just
make up your mind?

597
00:42:40.766 --> 00:42:42.017
- Cram it. will ya!

598
00:42:42.017 --> 00:42:44.436
I will have an ice
tea. hold the sugar.

599
00:42:44.436 --> 00:42:47.356
- Right and this is on
one check or separate?

600
00:42:47.356 --> 00:42:48.482
- One check.

601
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:52.111
- Well hell. if I'd a know
that. I would've upgraded

602
00:42:52.111 --> 00:42:53.362
to the deluxe. man.

603
00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.115
- Yeah. PBR would would have
had a little lemon twist

604
00:42:56.115 --> 00:42:57.449
in his water.

605
00:42:57.449 --> 00:42:58.951
- You're hysterical.

606
00:42:58.951 --> 00:43:01.537
You are one of the smartest
simpletons I've ever met.

607
00:43:03.706 --> 00:43:07.167
- Smart enough to bang your
old lady at your son's baptism.

608
00:43:07.167 --> 00:43:08.711
- You said you were
never gonna mention that!

609
00:43:08.711 --> 00:43:10.129
- Wait a minute.

610
00:43:10.129 --> 00:43:12.172
Your wife old lady
or your mom old lady?

611
00:43:13.382 --> 00:43:14.842
- My mom old lady.

612
00:43:14.842 --> 00:43:16.635
She was single at the time.

613
00:43:16.635 --> 00:43:17.970
- Unbelievable!

614
00:43:17.970 --> 00:43:20.848
You banged his mom
at his son's baptism?

615
00:43:20.848 --> 00:43:23.684
- Well. like he said. she
was single at the time.

616
00:43:23.684 --> 00:43:25.644
- How come I wasn't invited?

617
00:43:25.644 --> 00:43:27.646
- Why. so you could watch?

618
00:43:27.646 --> 00:43:29.189
- I like baptisms.

619
00:43:29.189 --> 00:43:31.150
- That's not what I
was talking about dummy.

620
00:43:31.150 --> 00:43:33.319
- Guys. guys. guys. come on.
we've been here 20 minutes.

621
00:43:33.319 --> 00:43:35.362
we're already at
each other's throats.

622
00:43:35.362 --> 00:43:38.866
All right. can we just get
along and have a nice meal?

623
00:43:38.866 --> 00:43:40.743
- Not very likely.

624
00:43:40.743 --> 00:43:43.037
I mean. why are we here?

625
00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:44.997
You know how much we enjoy
each other's company.

626
00:43:44.997 --> 00:43:47.041
I didn't mention this
on the phone but...

627
00:43:48.334 --> 00:43:49.168
- But what?

628
00:43:50.836 --> 00:43:53.005
- I don't quite know
how to say this.

629
00:43:54.006 --> 00:43:54.840
- Spit it out.

630
00:43:59.094 --> 00:44:00.429
- Nia--

631
00:44:01.347 --> 00:44:02.181
She wanted to ask us something.

632
00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:03.432
- Yeah. ask us what?

633
00:44:03.432 --> 00:44:05.934
- I don't know. she just
wanted us all together.

634
00:44:05.934 --> 00:44:07.686
- How long are we supposed
to wait for her majesty?

635
00:44:07.686 --> 00:44:09.188
- She'll be here any minute.

636
00:44:09.188 --> 00:44:10.356
Look. I just didn't want
one of you guys to turn tail

637
00:44:10.356 --> 00:44:12.191
and run if you saw her
before she saw you.

638
00:44:12.191 --> 00:44:13.359
- Sit down.
- Come on.

639
00:44:13.359 --> 00:44:15.527
- I am not gonna sit
here with this jezebel.

640
00:44:15.527 --> 00:44:16.695
- Jezebel!

641
00:44:16.695 --> 00:44:18.197
Jesus Christ. what
happened to you!

642
00:44:18.197 --> 00:44:20.366
We need to listen to what she
has to say and just man up!

643
00:44:20.366 --> 00:44:21.909
- Man up?

644
00:44:21.909 --> 00:44:23.035
What the hell do you
think we've been doing

645
00:44:23.035 --> 00:44:24.620
for the last 25 years?

646
00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.372
Manning up!

647
00:44:26.372 --> 00:44:28.374
This guy sells used cars.

648
00:44:28.374 --> 00:44:30.042
This one over here
changes the oil

649
00:44:30.042 --> 00:44:32.127
for the used cars he sells.

650
00:44:32.127 --> 00:44:33.045
What the hell do you do?

651
00:44:33.045 --> 00:44:35.381
You a stock boy this week?

652
00:44:35.381 --> 00:44:38.884
And I. I give music lessons
to all those snot-nose

653
00:44:38.884 --> 00:44:41.887
mouth breathers and
their undeserving.
ungrateful children.

654
00:44:41.887 --> 00:44:43.389
I know all about manning up!

655
00:44:48.894 --> 00:44:52.898
All my life. all I've ever
wanted to be is a rock star.

656
00:44:52.898 --> 00:44:55.567
I think that goes for
everyone sitting here.

657
00:44:55.567 --> 00:44:57.736
Nia coulda done that for us.

658
00:44:57.736 --> 00:45:00.781
Instead. she took the high
road and left us sitting here.

659
00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:01.740
to man up.

660
00:45:03.075 --> 00:45:04.410
- Well. you really got hung up

661
00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:06.453
on that man up
thing. didn't you?

662
00:45:06.453 --> 00:45:08.997
- Come on. man. we're
already here. just sit down.

663
00:45:08.997 --> 00:45:10.916
Let's here what she's
gotta say. okay?

664
00:45:13.001 --> 00:45:15.337
- Here's your ice
tea. hold the sugar.

665
00:45:17.923 --> 00:45:19.258
- Well. speak of the devil.

666
00:45:20.134 --> 00:45:21.969
- Well. well. well.

667
00:45:23.429 --> 00:45:27.141
What a fine looking bunch
of men we have here tonight.

668
00:45:29.268 --> 00:45:30.936
God. how's it hanging boys?

669
00:45:30.936 --> 00:45:32.938
Low and the to the left?

670
00:45:32.938 --> 00:45:34.440
- Eh. high and to the right.

671
00:45:36.108 --> 00:45:36.942
- Good!

672
00:45:37.943 --> 00:45:40.946
So. you all have been

673
00:45:40.946 --> 00:45:43.615
in and out of this
thing called life.

674
00:45:43.615 --> 00:45:45.826
What. married. divorced?

675
00:45:45.826 --> 00:45:46.827
- What's it to you?

676
00:45:49.121 --> 00:45:51.457
- Well. just wondering what
my boys have been up to.

677
00:45:52.291 --> 00:45:53.792
- Your boys.

678
00:45:53.792 --> 00:45:56.545
We haven't been your boys for
what. almost 25 years now?

679
00:45:58.630 --> 00:46:01.467
- Yeah. it has been
about 25 years.

680
00:46:03.051 --> 00:46:05.471
Oh. but you'll
always be my boys.

681
00:46:10.309 --> 00:46:11.643
So. how's the food here?

682
00:46:13.061 --> 00:46:14.980
- Could order you
the diablo sandwich.

683
00:46:17.649 --> 00:46:22.654
- I think I'll say what I came
here to say and be on my way.

684
00:46:26.992 --> 00:46:30.496
I've done some pretty
shitty things in my life.

685
00:46:33.081 --> 00:46:34.833
Some of them to you guys here.

686
00:46:36.835 --> 00:46:40.506
I hope you've had
more ups than downs.

687
00:46:40.506 --> 00:46:43.926
these last 25 years
and if you haven't.

688
00:46:46.345 --> 00:46:47.763
I'm truly sorry.

689
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:51.683
What I came here to say is.

690
00:46:52.851 --> 00:46:55.521
I want to put on a show here.

691
00:46:56.939 --> 00:46:59.358
with you. before I retire.

692
00:47:00.692 --> 00:47:02.736
- We've been retired already.

693
00:47:02.736 --> 00:47:04.696
- When would this
show take place?

694
00:47:04.696 --> 00:47:06.782
- Two week.
- Two weeks?

695
00:47:07.866 --> 00:47:09.117
What are you fucking crazy?

696
00:47:09.117 --> 00:47:11.036
Why don't we just
wait till summer?

697
00:47:11.036 --> 00:47:12.538
- I can't wait till the summer.

698
00:47:13.539 --> 00:47:15.457
- Do we get paid for this.

699
00:47:15.457 --> 00:47:16.959
because I got a lot of
oil changes coming up?

700
00:47:16.959 --> 00:47:20.546
- This is Carl. my
manager and not the ogre

701
00:47:20.546 --> 00:47:23.215
that was once my representation.

702
00:47:23.215 --> 00:47:24.216
Carl. if you would.

703
00:47:28.053 --> 00:47:30.222
This is a little
something to say I'm sorry

704
00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:34.142
and hopefully no hard feelings.

705
00:47:36.728 --> 00:47:39.398
- Sorry boys. I don't care
what's in this envelope.

706
00:47:39.398 --> 00:47:40.399
I ain't playin'.

707
00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:45.571
- Oh and either we
all play together

708
00:47:45.571 --> 00:47:46.822
or none of us does.

709
00:47:49.616 --> 00:47:52.411
That goes for what's
in those envelopes too.

710
00:47:52.411 --> 00:47:53.745
Carl. can I have the keys?

711
00:47:56.081 --> 00:47:58.500
- What am I gonna
do. take an Uber?

712
00:47:58.500 --> 00:47:59.751
- You'll work it out.

713
00:48:03.630 --> 00:48:04.923
- Do we open these things?

714
00:48:04.923 --> 00:48:07.426
- Yeah. well that's
the general idea.

715
00:48:07.426 --> 00:48:10.429
- I told you already. I don't
care what's in this envelope

716
00:48:10.429 --> 00:48:11.638
I'm not playing.

717
00:48:11.638 --> 00:48:12.973
- What you're gonna
do is shut the fuck up

718
00:48:12.973 --> 00:48:14.683
and open the envelope. okay?

719
00:48:15.934 --> 00:48:17.102
- How may zeroes is that?

720
00:48:17.102 --> 00:48:18.854
- Mine says six!
- That's what mine says.

721
00:48:18.854 --> 00:48:21.773
- God dammit PBR. you'll
be playing the show.

722
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:24.109
- What is she doing?

723
00:48:24.109 --> 00:48:25.777
- She's liquidating her accounts

724
00:48:25.777 --> 00:48:27.779
and she doesn't want
anything wrapped in red tape

725
00:48:27.779 --> 00:48:29.615
when she retires.

726
00:48:29.615 --> 00:48:31.116
But to be completely honest.

727
00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.702
she's trying to make amends.

728
00:48:36.622 --> 00:48:39.958
- Will she have anything left
over for her own retirement?

729
00:48:39.958 --> 00:48:42.628
- Yeah. she'll have
something left in the tank.

730
00:48:42.628 --> 00:48:43.837
- God help the angels.

731
00:48:45.297 --> 00:48:46.465
- God help the angels.

732
00:48:58.143 --> 00:48:59.853
- You missed
your appointments.

733
00:49:02.814 --> 00:49:04.816
- I haven't
smoked or drank

734
00:49:04.816 --> 00:49:07.486
or had a dick inside
me for three years.

735
00:49:07.486 --> 00:49:08.987
- You missed
your appointments.

736
00:49:08.987 --> 00:49:12.658
- Yeah. but you yanked out
all the baby-making parts.

737
00:49:12.658 --> 00:49:14.660
Didn't that make a dent?

738
00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:16.745
- Okay. I'll say something else.

739
00:49:16.745 --> 00:49:19.665
Surgery is out.

740
00:49:19.665 --> 00:49:22.167
Radiation is the only
thing I can think of

741
00:49:22.167 --> 00:49:23.418
that might prolong you--

742
00:49:24.753 --> 00:49:29.508
- What. my quality
or quantity of life?

743
00:49:29.508 --> 00:49:31.259
- Hopefully both.

744
00:49:31.259 --> 00:49:35.222
- Would doing anything else
keep me from the inevitable?

745
00:49:36.848 --> 00:49:39.685
- No. I'm sorry Roxy. no.

746
00:49:51.029 --> 00:49:52.197
- Always time.

747
00:50:26.398 --> 00:50:27.941
- No. it's still not coming up.

748
00:50:29.234 --> 00:50:30.610
I bet we got a bad dimmer.

749
00:50:30.610 --> 00:50:32.070
- Maybe it's a lamp.

750
00:50:32.070 --> 00:50:33.280
- How could it be the lamp?

751
00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:35.574
We have four dark
instruments out here.

752
00:50:35.574 --> 00:50:37.284
- Anything yet?
- No!

753
00:50:40.245 --> 00:50:41.580
- How bout now?

754
00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:43.832
- No. all I'm seeing is
a whole lot of nothing.

755
00:50:43.832 --> 00:50:45.917
It's gotta be a
bad dimmer. dammit!

756
00:50:46.793 --> 00:50:48.003
- All right. give me a minute.

757
00:50:48.003 --> 00:50:50.922
Remember. I'm just your
box office manager.

758
00:50:52.591 --> 00:50:55.510
- Whoa shit!

759
00:50:56.928 --> 00:50:58.930
- You got the box office
manager doing the lights?

760
00:50:59.931 --> 00:51:01.099
- Can I help you miss?

761
00:51:02.642 --> 00:51:03.477
- I don't know.

762
00:51:05.645 --> 00:51:07.105
maybe I can help you.

763
00:51:09.649 --> 00:51:12.986
- Holy shit. Roxy Starr!

764
00:51:12.986 --> 00:51:14.196
What are you doin' here?

765
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:17.449
- Well. I was just
coming to. I don't know.

766
00:51:17.449 --> 00:51:20.952
see how you are. talk
a little business.

767
00:51:20.952 --> 00:51:23.455
What the hell's that for
sale sign doing out in front?

768
00:51:23.455 --> 00:51:27.167
- Oh God. Roxy times
have been tough.

769
00:51:27.167 --> 00:51:28.627
I can barely keep the lights on.

770
00:51:28.627 --> 00:51:30.837
- Don't you get any
acts anymore. though?

771
00:51:30.837 --> 00:51:34.174
- Half-ass comedians. indie
movies. stuff like that.

772
00:51:34.174 --> 00:51:35.801
- No bands?

773
00:51:35.801 --> 00:51:37.010
- No.

774
00:51:37.010 --> 00:51:38.887
Bands are gone with
the wind. Roxy.

775
00:51:38.887 --> 00:51:40.806
Casinos have killed
the bands for me.

776
00:51:40.806 --> 00:51:42.974
I just can't compete
with their prices.

777
00:51:42.974 --> 00:51:44.017
Not like it used to be.

778
00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:47.312
So now. you said
something about business.

779
00:51:47.312 --> 00:51:48.563
You're not by any chance

780
00:51:48.563 --> 00:51:49.648
thinking about buying
this place. are you?

781
00:51:49.648 --> 00:51:51.733
- Oh. no.

782
00:51:52.859 --> 00:51:54.236
But I do want to do a show.

783
00:51:55.987 --> 00:51:57.322
- You?

784
00:51:57.322 --> 00:51:59.324
- Yeah. of course me.

785
00:51:59.324 --> 00:52:01.993
- Holy shit Roxy. I
mean you play arenas.

786
00:52:01.993 --> 00:52:02.994
Why here?

787
00:52:04.496 --> 00:52:06.331
- 'Cause this is
where it all began.

788
00:52:07.707 --> 00:52:08.750
I want to give back.

789
00:52:11.336 --> 00:52:15.006
- I'm appreciative. but let
me straight with you Roxy.

790
00:52:15.006 --> 00:52:17.175
I have absolutely nothing.

791
00:52:17.175 --> 00:52:18.844
When do you want to
do this. maybe I can--

792
00:52:18.844 --> 00:52:21.012
- No. no. no Don. Don. relax.

793
00:52:21.012 --> 00:52:22.514
You don't have to do anything.

794
00:52:23.598 --> 00:52:25.350
You just make sure
the doors are unlocked

795
00:52:25.350 --> 00:52:27.352
and the bathrooms are clean.

796
00:52:27.352 --> 00:52:29.521
I'll handle everything.

797
00:52:29.521 --> 00:52:32.190
You get the door.
concessions. all of that.

798
00:52:33.942 --> 00:52:36.361
But the show has to
happen next Saturday.

799
00:52:36.361 --> 00:52:37.195
- Next Saturday?

800
00:52:38.446 --> 00:52:40.407
Carter. anything going
on next Saturday?

801
00:52:42.033 --> 00:52:43.702
- We've got
that magician guy.

802
00:52:43.702 --> 00:52:46.746
Roy the Magnificent
and His Flying Dogs.

803
00:52:46.746 --> 00:52:48.206
- Scrap 'em!

804
00:52:48.206 --> 00:52:51.126
- Oh. you like dogs?
- I love dogs.

805
00:52:51.126 --> 00:52:53.253
- Keep the dogs.
scrap the magician!

806
00:52:53.253 --> 00:52:55.881
- You already
gave him a $500 deposit.

807
00:52:55.881 --> 00:52:58.550
- I think we can eat it
Carter. don't worry about it.

808
00:53:00.218 --> 00:53:01.386
Roxy's come home.

809
00:53:02.721 --> 00:53:04.973
- Oh and another thing.
get rid of that fucking

810
00:53:04.973 --> 00:53:06.391
for sale sign out front.

811
00:53:06.391 --> 00:53:07.893
- You got it.

812
00:53:07.893 --> 00:53:08.935
Hoo hoo!

813
00:53:09.895 --> 00:53:11.146
- Welcome to the morning crash.

814
00:53:11.146 --> 00:53:13.273
Another beautiful day
in Michigan. folks.

815
00:53:13.273 --> 00:53:15.901
We got a whopping high
of 38 degrees today.

816
00:53:15.901 --> 00:53:17.402
Temps look about
the same tomorrow.

817
00:53:17.402 --> 00:53:19.946
although we're gonna see
some rain turned to snow.

818
00:53:19.946 --> 00:53:21.740
so watch those roads. folks.

819
00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:23.783
I'm gonna take a quick break
so we can hear a few words

820
00:53:23.783 --> 00:53:27.245
from the people that salary
and I'll be back in a crash.

821
00:53:30.123 --> 00:53:31.416
Can I get some
coffee real quick?

822
00:53:31.416 --> 00:53:32.918
- Sure thing.

823
00:53:32.918 --> 00:53:34.920
And there's someone here
that wants to talk to you.

824
00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.504
- What. on the air. who is it?

825
00:53:36.504 --> 00:53:38.089
- I don't know.

826
00:53:38.089 --> 00:53:39.090
- Why don't you ask?

827
00:53:40.508 --> 00:53:41.301
- Who are you?

828
00:53:42.260 --> 00:53:43.303
- How old are you. sweetie?

829
00:53:43.303 --> 00:53:44.137
- I'm 21.

830
00:53:45.305 --> 00:53:47.515
- And you work at
a rock station?

831
00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:49.434
- Yeah.

832
00:53:50.810 --> 00:53:53.271
- Do you know the history
of the genre of this music?

833
00:53:53.271 --> 00:53:55.148
- Yes. I think so.

834
00:53:55.148 --> 00:53:59.110
- So. if I were to throw
out a name in the classic

835
00:53:59.110 --> 00:54:01.446
rock field. you'd know it?
- I think so.

836
00:54:02.614 --> 00:54:03.657
- The person that
stands before you

837
00:54:03.657 --> 00:54:05.450
is a fucking rock goddess.

838
00:54:05.450 --> 00:54:08.620
- Crash. I'm going to call
security on this lady.

839
00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:09.955
This psycho comes in here

840
00:54:09.955 --> 00:54:12.123
and claims she's the
fucking rock goddess.

841
00:54:12.123 --> 00:54:13.959
Probably some
washed up porn star.

842
00:54:13.959 --> 00:54:15.168
I'm about to call security.

843
00:54:15.168 --> 00:54:17.295
- She is the rock
goddess you ding dong!

844
00:54:17.295 --> 00:54:20.966
I am so sorry. interns.
you know how it goes.

845
00:54:20.966 --> 00:54:23.301
I'm sorry. I'm Crash.

846
00:54:23.301 --> 00:54:26.304
Yeah. I just thought maybe you
were one of my bosses's wives

847
00:54:26.304 --> 00:54:28.515
or mistresses or something.

848
00:54:28.515 --> 00:54:31.226
- No. no. I don't qualify
for any of those. yet.

849
00:54:32.727 --> 00:54:33.979
- Crash. we've got dead air.

850
00:54:33.979 --> 00:54:35.814
- Oh shit. we've got dead air.

851
00:54:35.814 --> 00:54:38.650
How can I help you Miss Starr?

852
00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:41.486
- Well. I was hoping we could
fill some of that dead air.

853
00:54:42.654 --> 00:54:46.157
- You with me. now
together on the air?

854
00:54:46.157 --> 00:54:47.409
- On the air. together.

855
00:54:47.409 --> 00:54:49.995
I mean. off the air we
can discuss that later.

856
00:54:51.413 --> 00:54:52.247
- Yeah. come on.

857
00:54:53.665 --> 00:54:55.166
I have to admit.
you're the biggest star

858
00:54:55.166 --> 00:54:58.503
I've ever interviewed. so.
please excuse the drool.

859
00:54:58.503 --> 00:54:59.921
- Ah. don't worry about it.

860
00:54:59.921 --> 00:55:01.840
You can drool on me later.

861
00:55:03.341 --> 00:55:05.176
- Hey. you're not gonna get
me in trouble are you. Roxy?

862
00:55:05.176 --> 00:55:08.346
I mean. I know about
your rep. the language.

863
00:55:08.346 --> 00:55:11.182
- Well. Crash. you just keep
your finger on that little drop

864
00:55:11.182 --> 00:55:13.768
button. we'll be fine.

865
00:55:13.768 --> 00:55:15.770
- Sorry about the technical
difficulties folks.

866
00:55:15.770 --> 00:55:18.606
but the moment of silence
is gonna be well worth it.

867
00:55:18.606 --> 00:55:22.277
I kid you not. the rock goddess
herself has just walked in

868
00:55:22.277 --> 00:55:25.405
to the studio. Roxy Starr.

869
00:55:25.405 --> 00:55:27.032
I don't know where to begin.

870
00:55:27.032 --> 00:55:30.035
- Well. first of all Crash. I
told you to keep your finger

871
00:55:30.035 --> 00:55:31.578
on that little button.

872
00:55:31.578 --> 00:55:33.204
We don't want the
FCC coming after us

873
00:55:33.204 --> 00:55:34.456
like a swarm of locusts.

874
00:55:34.456 --> 00:55:36.041
- And you promised
me you'd be good.

875
00:55:36.041 --> 00:55:38.084
- Well yeah. good for
me might not be good

876
00:55:38.084 --> 00:55:39.753
for the common Joe.

877
00:55:39.753 --> 00:55:43.214
- Okay. so how ya been.
what've you been up to?

878
00:55:43.214 --> 00:55:44.424
You been kinda quiet
these last few years.

879
00:55:44.424 --> 00:55:47.218
- Yeah. yeah it's true.

880
00:55:47.218 --> 00:55:49.971
I been laying low.
taking it easy.

881
00:55:49.971 --> 00:55:52.223
you know recharging my juices.

882
00:55:52.223 --> 00:55:54.225
- Okay. okay. what
brings you to town?

883
00:55:54.225 --> 00:55:56.394
- Oh. seeing family and friends

884
00:55:57.270 --> 00:55:58.772
and I'm gonna put on a show.

885
00:55:58.772 --> 00:56:00.940
- No fucking way. you're
doing a show here?

886
00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:03.568
- Uh. did you have your
finger on the button?

887
00:56:03.568 --> 00:56:05.153
- No. why you gonna swear?

888
00:56:05.153 --> 00:56:06.279
- No. but you did.

889
00:56:09.407 --> 00:56:12.744
- Wow. a show in Kalamazoo. huh?

890
00:56:12.744 --> 00:56:14.412
Where. when?

891
00:56:14.412 --> 00:56:15.955
- At the Barn Theater.

892
00:56:15.955 --> 00:56:18.666
It all happens next
Saturday. March 5th.

893
00:56:18.666 --> 00:56:20.085
- Next Saturday. this month?

894
00:56:21.086 --> 00:56:22.837
No time to lose. folks.

895
00:56:22.837 --> 00:56:23.963
- That's right. get on
over to the Barn Theater.

896
00:56:23.963 --> 00:56:25.465
get some tickets.

897
00:56:25.465 --> 00:56:28.593
- All right. well what's that
phone number or the website?

898
00:56:28.593 --> 00:56:31.262
- Crash. I can't remember
my own lyrics.

899
00:56:31.262 --> 00:56:33.765
- Okay. we'll get that
information out to you folks.

900
00:56:33.765 --> 00:56:36.267
Now here's the
real question Roxy.

901
00:56:36.267 --> 00:56:37.685
are you gonna be
leaving your clothes on

902
00:56:37.685 --> 00:56:40.480
for the performance
because you know.

903
00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:44.651
Kalamazoo does have a no
nudity ordinance in place. so.

904
00:56:44.651 --> 00:56:47.028
- Well. that's sure upsetting.

905
00:56:47.028 --> 00:56:50.281
But I don't think anybody
wants to see my old coochie.

906
00:56:51.449 --> 00:56:53.493
Oh. can I say
coochie on the air?

907
00:56:54.661 --> 00:56:56.204
- I think coochie's
just fine. yeah.

908
00:56:57.455 --> 00:57:00.291
If not. I'll find
out. the hard way.

909
00:57:00.291 --> 00:57:03.128
- The hard way?
- Or the semi-hard way.

910
00:57:08.049 --> 00:57:10.677
- Yeah. this show. something
I've always wanted to do

911
00:57:10.677 --> 00:57:12.637
with the original band.

912
00:57:12.637 --> 00:57:16.391
Kind of a last hoorah.
that sort of thing.

913
00:57:17.475 --> 00:57:18.685
- So this is it?

914
00:57:18.685 --> 00:57:21.479
- I mean. I'm gonna
be 50 years old.

915
00:57:21.479 --> 00:57:24.482
I can't raunch and
roll any more for real.

916
00:57:24.482 --> 00:57:26.985
I mean. some can.
but nah. I can't.

917
00:57:27.819 --> 00:57:30.155
- You. my lady. are a legend.

918
00:57:30.155 --> 00:57:31.990
Listen. I'm sorry. I gotta
go to commercial real quick

919
00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:33.158
but can you stick
around a little longer.

920
00:57:33.158 --> 00:57:34.909
- Oh no. I gotta go.

921
00:57:34.909 --> 00:57:37.829
- Okay. thank you so
much for coming in today.

922
00:57:37.829 --> 00:57:39.330
- Thanks for almost having me.

923
00:57:46.713 --> 00:57:47.505
Crash.

924
00:57:49.090 --> 00:57:50.884
put your eyes back
in their sockets.

925
00:58:26.794 --> 00:58:27.921
- Rox?

926
00:58:27.921 --> 00:58:29.214
You all right. sweetie?

927
00:58:29.214 --> 00:58:30.882
- Yeah. never better.

928
00:58:32.717 --> 00:58:33.551
Ugh.

929
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:38.556
Did you get it?

930
00:58:38.556 --> 00:58:40.058
- Yeah. I got it. I got it.

931
00:58:40.058 --> 00:58:41.976
It's. I don't know why I
just couldn't pick it up

932
00:58:41.976 --> 00:58:43.728
in a regular music
store. though.

933
00:58:43.728 --> 00:58:46.731
- 'Cause it's a factory
made guitar from Kalamazoo.

934
00:58:46.731 --> 00:58:47.565
that's why.

935
00:58:48.775 --> 00:58:51.319
Johnny's gonna learn
to play the guitar.

936
00:58:57.742 --> 00:58:59.744
- Okay. come on. here you go.

937
00:58:59.744 --> 00:59:00.620
Wipe your mouth.
wipe your mouth.

938
00:59:00.620 --> 00:59:01.913
let's get into bed here.

939
00:59:01.913 --> 00:59:04.249
- Wait. let me just
wait here for a minute.

940
00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.293
- You can't do this concert.

941
00:59:07.293 --> 00:59:08.127
It's...

942
00:59:08.127 --> 00:59:09.629
- What?

943
00:59:09.629 --> 00:59:10.588
Gonna kill me?

944
00:59:15.426 --> 00:59:16.427
No. I have to.

945
00:59:18.972 --> 00:59:20.765
I'm not gonna be
around much longer.

946
00:59:22.183 --> 00:59:23.476
It's all coming to an end.

947
00:59:40.618 --> 00:59:42.370
You're not lookin'
at my ass. are you?

948
00:59:42.370 --> 00:59:44.831
- No. I wasn't
looking at your ass.

949
00:59:44.831 --> 00:59:47.959
- Well. it's official.

950
00:59:47.959 --> 00:59:50.295
My ass has lost its magic.

951
00:59:51.671 --> 00:59:54.465
I'm waving it in your face
and you couldn't care less.

952
00:59:54.465 --> 00:59:58.803
- Rox. it's more of a vomit
thing than as ass-waving thing

953
00:59:58.803 --> 01:00:01.139
at this point. you
know what I mean?

954
01:00:04.809 --> 01:00:07.228
- I haven't made music
in such a long time.

955
01:00:08.688 --> 01:00:10.023
I treated you like shit.

956
01:00:12.483 --> 01:00:13.735
Why'd you stay with me?

957
01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:17.488
- Your uh. your ass.

958
01:00:25.163 --> 01:00:27.665
I have my reasons. Rox.

959
01:00:27.665 --> 01:00:29.000
- Such as?

960
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.046
- Rox. I could never
walk away from you.

961
01:00:34.672 --> 01:00:37.925
You came into my life
at the perfect moment.

962
01:00:37.925 --> 01:00:39.385
Before I met you.

963
01:00:39.385 --> 01:00:42.722
I was a veteran of this
thing we call life.

964
01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:47.352
I went to USC. I married a
nice girl. and I had a son.

965
01:00:48.895 --> 01:00:50.855
- What's his name?

966
01:00:50.855 --> 01:00:53.191
- Joshua. we called him Josh.

967
01:00:54.275 --> 01:00:55.610
He was a beautiful boy.

968
01:00:56.861 --> 01:00:59.364
- He was a beautiful boy.

969
01:01:01.115 --> 01:01:02.367
- Yeah. he died.

970
01:01:03.576 --> 01:01:04.952
There's nothing I could do.

971
01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:07.205
Then the marriage fell apart

972
01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:09.207
and nothing I could
do about that.

973
01:01:10.291 --> 01:01:11.918
But for a little while.

974
01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:14.712
I was pretty important
to a couple people.

975
01:01:14.712 --> 01:01:17.548
I seemed to make a difference
and my life had meaning.

976
01:01:17.548 --> 01:01:21.052
I had purpose and then nothing.

977
01:01:23.388 --> 01:01:24.722
That's when you came along.

978
01:01:25.723 --> 01:01:27.266
You taught me how to live again.

979
01:01:28.726 --> 01:01:33.606
But you know Rox. recently I
feel like I've been excluded.

980
01:01:36.567 --> 01:01:39.821
And I'm feeling like I've
lost that purpose again.

981
01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:44.242
- I'm so sorry.

982
01:01:46.327 --> 01:01:48.413
You know. I came back
home to make amends.

983
01:01:49.747 --> 01:01:51.666
I left a lot of
people in the dust.

984
01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:54.752
Tommy's the only one
I kept in touch with.

985
01:01:56.587 --> 01:01:59.424
And you probably
figured out by now

986
01:02:01.926 --> 01:02:03.594
the result of that.

987
01:02:03.594 --> 01:02:04.429
- Rox.

988
01:02:06.931 --> 01:02:09.851
Your only problem.
you never found love.

989
01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:13.604
Love is your only downfall.

990
01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:18.443
- You're a wise
bastard. you know that.

991
01:02:19.610 --> 01:02:21.279
Thank you for
being here with me.

992
01:02:22.447 --> 01:02:23.990
Hey. what about
your client list?

993
01:02:25.032 --> 01:02:26.784
I'm not your only one. am I?

994
01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:30.621
- No. you're not my only client.

995
01:02:32.790 --> 01:02:36.043
I gotta couple of country acts.

996
01:02:37.795 --> 01:02:38.629
- Country.

997
01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.383
They're no fucking fun.

998
01:02:43.843 --> 01:02:48.139
- It's a living. but they're
certainly not as fun as you.

999
01:02:52.852 --> 01:02:55.980
- Hey. how come we never

1000
01:02:57.815 --> 01:02:58.649
got together?

1001
01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:03.488
- Because you were too wise
to mix business with pleasure.

1002
01:03:04.822 --> 01:03:09.744
- Oh yeah. yeah. you're
full of shit.

1003
01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:12.997
But I do love you.

1004
01:03:16.834 --> 01:03:18.503
You're the best
lover I've ever had.

1005
01:03:20.004 --> 01:03:21.172
- We never made love.

1006
01:03:25.092 --> 01:03:27.929
- You can be the best of lovers
without getting physical.

1007
01:03:30.181 --> 01:03:32.683
Josh. how did he die?

1008
01:03:34.185 --> 01:03:35.019
- Cancer.

1009
01:03:38.022 --> 01:03:40.399
- And they've given
me six months to live.

1010
01:03:42.610 --> 01:03:46.030
Now. I'm going to
get in the shower

1011
01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:48.115
and wash this puke off me.

1012
01:03:53.204 --> 01:03:55.289
You care to join me?

1013
01:03:55.289 --> 01:03:57.583
- And screw up this
beautiful relationship?

1014
01:04:05.383 --> 01:04:07.802
- Well. you wouldn't
want any of this anyway.

1015
01:04:07.802 --> 01:04:08.636
- Rox?

1016
01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.100
I want you now more than ever

1017
01:04:15.768 --> 01:04:17.562
and you've never
been more perfect.

1018
01:04:29.448 --> 01:04:33.661
Promise me you're not
gonna die on fucking stage.

1019
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:48.134
- Well. I do want to
go out with a splash.

1020
01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:57.101
I'll do my best to
keep that promise.

1021
01:05:12.283 --> 01:05:16.287
- Look. I'm the bass player.
so let me play the bass line.

1022
01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:17.163
- When do I come in?

1023
01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:19.123
- You don't come in!

1024
01:05:19.123 --> 01:05:21.167
- Quit bitching at
me. fumble fingers.

1025
01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:23.669
- Look. I'm sorry. I just
haven't picked this up

1026
01:05:23.669 --> 01:05:25.630
in a long fucking time!

1027
01:05:25.630 --> 01:05:27.465
You're the only one
that's been making music.

1028
01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:29.008
teaching these past 30 years.

1029
01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:30.134
- Yeah. you're
damn right I have.

1030
01:05:30.134 --> 01:05:31.636
so why don't you just zip it!

1031
01:05:31.636 --> 01:05:32.803
- Why don't you just zip it.

1032
01:05:32.803 --> 01:05:35.056
- Why don't both of
you just fucking zip it

1033
01:05:35.056 --> 01:05:36.807
and let's just get
through this number!

1034
01:05:36.807 --> 01:05:37.642
- This number.

1035
01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:41.062
What about the whole show. man!

1036
01:05:41.062 --> 01:05:42.313
We blow.

1037
01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:44.690
- Speak for yourself
about who blows.

1038
01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:47.026
- Hey Pabst. your mom
comin' to the show?

1039
01:05:47.026 --> 01:05:48.486
- Yeah. she might be.

1040
01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:49.987
- Good. then I'll know
someone who really blows.

1041
01:05:49.987 --> 01:05:50.821
- Dude. fuck you!

1042
01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:52.573
Fuck you too!

1043
01:05:52.573 --> 01:05:54.158
- Shut up. all of you.

1044
01:05:54.158 --> 01:05:55.493
we're just wasting time here!

1045
01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:57.161
- Well I haven't heard
any sweet rhythms

1046
01:05:57.161 --> 01:06:00.498
coming from your
direction there. clambone!

1047
01:06:00.498 --> 01:06:02.667
How long has it been since
you picked up your guitar?

1048
01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:04.752
- About 25 years. all right.
about the same as you.

1049
01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:07.171
about the same as most of us!

1050
01:06:07.171 --> 01:06:08.673
Where's your pride. man?

1051
01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:12.343
- Hey. I. I got pride

1052
01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:14.845
and I'm tired of
playing the fool.

1053
01:06:14.845 --> 01:06:17.932
This is the majors
and I ain't ready.

1054
01:06:17.932 --> 01:06:19.350
- None of are.

1055
01:06:19.350 --> 01:06:21.227
- You know. I'm about
ready to tell Nia's manager

1056
01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:24.021
to take that check and
shove it right up his ass.

1057
01:06:24.855 --> 01:06:25.690
- Oh yi yi.

1058
01:06:27.108 --> 01:06:29.527
I don't know how that would
feel at the entry point.

1059
01:06:29.527 --> 01:06:32.238
- Hey. you still haven't
deposited your check yet?

1060
01:06:33.364 --> 01:06:34.365
- I deposited it.

1061
01:06:36.867 --> 01:06:41.539
- Gentlemen. I don't know
you guys at all but Roxy does

1062
01:06:41.539 --> 01:06:43.124
and she wants to
do this concert.

1063
01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:45.710
- Why can't it wait till summer?

1064
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:48.421
I mean. look at us.
we're so far from ready.

1065
01:06:48.421 --> 01:06:49.880
Why now?

1066
01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:52.133
- The plain and simple
truth is there's no time.

1067
01:06:53.092 --> 01:06:54.969
Roxy's gonna die.

1068
01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:56.721
She's not gonna
see another summer.

1069
01:06:58.222 --> 01:07:01.225
She wants to do this concert
in Kalamazoo with her boys.

1070
01:07:04.228 --> 01:07:07.398
She's very loyal. believe
it or not. she is.

1071
01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.444
She took a big chance with me.

1072
01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:12.236
- How so?

1073
01:07:13.612 --> 01:07:16.991
- I had never handled an
artist of her caliber before.

1074
01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:20.578
I didn't have a client
list at all. really.

1075
01:07:20.578 --> 01:07:23.748
She chose me because
she said I had kind eyes

1076
01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:25.499
and I warned her. I said these
kinds eyes might not always

1077
01:07:25.499 --> 01:07:27.418
act in your benefit.

1078
01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:28.919
She says. at least if
I'm getting screwed

1079
01:07:28.919 --> 01:07:30.254
I can look you in the eyes.

1080
01:07:31.964 --> 01:07:35.009
I told her I would never
do that and I haven't.

1081
01:07:35.009 --> 01:07:37.428
- Her last management
really tore her up. huh?

1082
01:07:37.428 --> 01:07:39.096
- Figuratively and literally.

1083
01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:42.183
They didn't want you.

1084
01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:44.602
The label didn't want you guys.

1085
01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:47.271
Roxy didn't make a dime
until she signed with me.

1086
01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:50.441
There's not a lot of people
who can tell this tale

1087
01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:54.111
but she can. career-wise anyway.

1088
01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:59.283
You know. her music. her
talent is what kept her on top.

1089
01:08:00.284 --> 01:08:02.870
She's a goddamn rock goddess.

1090
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:04.538
I'm proud to be a part of that.

1091
01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:08.167
Musical acts are
gonna come and go

1092
01:08:08.167 --> 01:08:09.960
but she's the one
they're gonna remember

1093
01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.879
and you guys should
remember this.

1094
01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:14.048
she coulda brought
musicians in from New York.

1095
01:08:14.048 --> 01:08:17.551
L.A.. Nashville. but she
wanted to play with her boys.

1096
01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:22.515
So please stop screwing around
and learn the damn music.

1097
01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:44.036
- Sorry I'm late Mom.
rehearsal went long.

1098
01:08:47.706 --> 01:08:49.166
Guess you didn't wait for me.

1099
01:08:49.166 --> 01:08:51.502
- No Nia. I didn't wait for you.

1100
01:08:51.502 --> 01:08:55.172
I told you dinner was at six
and a quarter after I started.

1101
01:08:57.716 --> 01:08:59.885
I finished. but do
you want something?

1102
01:09:01.387 --> 01:09:02.221
- Sure.

1103
01:09:03.097 --> 01:09:04.181
I'll have a little.

1104
01:09:07.685 --> 01:09:09.687
- So. what's this
about a rehearsal.

1105
01:09:09.687 --> 01:09:11.355
you have something coming up?

1106
01:09:11.355 --> 01:09:13.691
- Yeah. there's a show
tomorrow night at the theater.

1107
01:09:13.691 --> 01:09:15.192
I saved you a seat.

1108
01:09:15.192 --> 01:09:18.195
- I have a board meeting
tomorrow night at the church.

1109
01:09:18.195 --> 01:09:20.364
We're gonna discuss how
to finance a new roof.

1110
01:09:20.364 --> 01:09:23.242
We have to come up with $16.000.

1111
01:09:23.242 --> 01:09:26.287
- Mom. I'd really
like you to be there.

1112
01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:28.205
This is gonna be my last show.

1113
01:09:29.915 --> 01:09:32.042
- You losing favor
with the masses?

1114
01:09:34.044 --> 01:09:36.589
- You know. if you're not
gonna cash the checks I send.

1115
01:09:36.589 --> 01:09:38.549
why don't you send
'em to church?

1116
01:09:38.549 --> 01:09:41.051
- There are things
money can't bring back.

1117
01:09:41.051 --> 01:09:43.053
You blew it!

1118
01:09:43.053 --> 01:09:46.223
Your father died and that
didn't bring you home.

1119
01:09:46.223 --> 01:09:48.893
You know. the only time
I knew you were alive

1120
01:09:48.893 --> 01:09:51.478
was when I saw you on
a cover of a tabloid

1121
01:09:51.478 --> 01:09:52.980
at a grocery store.

1122
01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:56.567
But the one man you shoulda
cared about the most.

1123
01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:58.068
you weren't there for him.

1124
01:09:59.987 --> 01:10:03.657
You were his little kuka.
so stop sending me checks.

1125
01:10:03.657 --> 01:10:05.409
I don't know how
you got that money.

1126
01:10:05.409 --> 01:10:08.579
Maybe by singing or
spreading your legs. or both.

1127
01:10:08.579 --> 01:10:10.998
Either way. stop
sending me money!

1128
01:10:12.166 --> 01:10:15.085
Your father took care
of me and obviously.

1129
01:10:15.085 --> 01:10:17.296
I screwed up raising you!

1130
01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.011
- You didn't screw up. Mom.

1131
01:10:26.597 --> 01:10:27.431
I did.

1132
01:10:32.686 --> 01:10:35.606
There will be a ticket
waiting for you tomorrow night

1133
01:10:35.606 --> 01:10:36.649
if you want.

1134
01:10:41.946 --> 01:10:43.155
Remember that I love you.

1135
01:10:58.629 --> 01:11:01.799
- All right. so you're
gonna put one finger there.

1136
01:11:01.799 --> 01:11:03.133
another there and then
the ring finger around.

1137
01:11:03.133 --> 01:11:05.469
now give that a strum.

1138
01:11:05.469 --> 01:11:06.887
That's a D chord. here. you try.

1139
01:11:09.181 --> 01:11:11.725
Almost. almost.
that's pretty good.

1140
01:11:11.725 --> 01:11:14.478
- Why do you spend time
teaching her the guitar?

1141
01:11:14.478 --> 01:11:16.981
Wouldn't she be better
suited learning the piano?

1142
01:11:22.152 --> 01:11:24.405
That's a much better way
for a girl to reach people.

1143
01:11:24.405 --> 01:11:27.157
- She'll reach the
people. believe me.

1144
01:11:28.242 --> 01:11:30.327
She will reach the people.

1145
01:11:30.327 --> 01:11:34.248
- Well. dinner's ready so
the people will have to wait.

1146
01:11:35.874 --> 01:11:37.334
And teach her the piano.

1147
01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:48.012
- Your mother's right. a girl
should probably learn piano.

1148
01:11:49.388 --> 01:11:50.222
Come on.

1149
01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:56.895
- Not if she
wants to be a rock star.

1150
01:21:22.085 --> 01:21:23.920
- Thank you. thank you!

1151
01:21:26.590 --> 01:21:29.301
How the fuck do
you do Kalamazoo.

1152
01:21:30.635 --> 01:21:32.012
Great to see you.

1153
01:21:33.179 --> 01:21:35.849
I'm so happy to be back
home in this state.

1154
01:21:35.849 --> 01:21:39.019
our beautiful Great Lakes state.

1155
01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:39.811
Yes!

1156
01:21:41.104 --> 01:21:44.357
First things first. I
want to introduce you

1157
01:21:44.357 --> 01:21:48.278
to my girls. all the way
from L.A.. Alexa and Madison.

1158
01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:49.821
Give it up for these beauties!

1159
01:21:51.114 --> 01:21:52.616
Whoo. that's right!

1160
01:21:52.616 --> 01:21:53.783
They've been with me for

1161
01:21:55.285 --> 01:21:58.038
for most of my career.

1162
01:21:58.038 --> 01:22:02.167
Kalamazoo. it's been
brought to my attention

1163
01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:05.629
that nudity is no
more in Kalamazoo.

1164
01:22:11.134 --> 01:22:12.302
I don't think
anybody wants to see

1165
01:22:12.302 --> 01:22:14.471
my tired old coochie
anymore anyway.

1166
01:22:15.805 --> 01:22:17.641
Doesn't mean I
can't sing about it.

1167
01:24:52.045 --> 01:24:55.298
Here's the audience
participation part.

1168
01:24:55.298 --> 01:24:57.300
Now. with help from you
and me and the band.

1169
01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:00.470
we're gonna work together to
get through this next part.

1170
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:04.641
Now you all know the
words. raunch and roll.

1171
01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:05.975
That's what you and
the band are gonna say.

1172
01:25:05.975 --> 01:25:08.978
I'm gonna pull up the
rear with the next line.

1173
01:25:08.978 --> 01:25:11.523
Now I'm gonna count you
in and I want you to say

1174
01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:13.817
raunch and roll. all right?

1175
01:25:17.695 --> 01:25:18.530
One. two.

1176
01:25:19.405 --> 01:25:21.324
one. two. three. let's go.

1177
01:25:38.675 --> 01:25:40.009
But this time. we're
gonna blow the rafters

1178
01:25:40.009 --> 01:25:42.512
off this old theater
and reach the sky.

1179
01:25:42.512 --> 01:25:43.513
Are you with me?

1180
01:25:44.722 --> 01:25:47.517
I said. are you with me?

1181
01:25:47.517 --> 01:25:49.185
Okay. let's do this.

1182
01:25:50.353 --> 01:25:51.938
One. two.

1183
01:25:51.938 --> 01:25:53.189
one. two. three.

1184
01:25:53.189 --> 01:25:54.107
Let's go.

1185
01:26:03.032 --> 01:26:05.118
Thank you. ha. thank you.

1186
01:26:07.370 --> 01:26:11.583
You know. no matter how
many times I do that song.

1187
01:26:11.583 --> 01:26:14.711
I never get tired
of it.

1188
01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:18.798
You know. nowhere else.
but in our great land.

1189
01:26:18.798 --> 01:26:21.926
can a group of total
strangers come together

1190
01:26:21.926 --> 01:26:26.806
and have a sing along
about my crotch.

1191
01:26:28.266 --> 01:26:30.727
That song put me on
the map about. wow.

1192
01:26:32.729 --> 01:26:34.564
about 25 years ago.

1193
01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:39.235
Brought me a little bit of
fame. a little bit of fortune.

1194
01:26:40.403 --> 01:26:43.948
but this next song
brought me a lot of fame

1195
01:26:45.783 --> 01:26:47.785
and a shit ton of fortune.

1196
01:26:49.913 --> 01:26:53.082
Eh. but what's the difference?

1197
01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:26.129
Thank you very. very much.

1198
01:30:26.129 --> 01:30:28.214
Can I get a stool please?

1199
01:30:32.176 --> 01:30:35.179
Yeah. I thought we'd get
a little intimate here.

1200
01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:41.561
You know. I've been in this
business more than half my life

1201
01:30:41.561 --> 01:30:44.021
and the money and the men.

1202
01:30:44.021 --> 01:30:47.066
they've been a
blessing and a curse.

1203
01:30:48.192 --> 01:30:52.989
I always seem to fuck
it up until about

1204
01:30:54.824 --> 01:30:55.992
14 years ago.

1205
01:30:57.410 --> 01:30:59.328
I gave birth to a son.

1206
01:31:01.747 --> 01:31:03.332
But I gave him up for adoption.

1207
01:31:05.209 --> 01:31:08.671
I knew I was never
gonna be a good mother.

1208
01:31:08.671 --> 01:31:11.340
I've always known that.

1209
01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:13.426
You know and I've always
tried to find love

1210
01:31:16.012 --> 01:31:17.680
but I can't.

1211
01:31:17.680 --> 01:31:20.349
Love has always eluded me.

1212
01:31:23.227 --> 01:31:26.689
So hopefully my gift
to you is my music.

1213
01:31:30.026 --> 01:31:31.944
It's the only thing
I haven't destroyed.

1214
01:31:35.072 --> 01:31:35.865
Let's go boys.

1215
01:31:38.201 --> 01:31:39.202
Stand afront.

1216
01:35:02.405 --> 01:35:04.573
You know. I've been keeping
a low profile lately

1217
01:35:04.573 --> 01:35:07.243
and there's a reason for that.

1218
01:35:09.245 --> 01:35:10.579
I've been fighting to live

1219
01:35:12.832 --> 01:35:14.625
and I am losing that fight.

1220
01:35:16.335 --> 01:35:18.421
That's why I'm doing this show.

1221
01:35:18.421 --> 01:35:20.965
I wanted to have one last gig

1222
01:35:22.133 --> 01:35:23.592
with the guys I
started out with.

1223
01:35:27.096 --> 01:35:31.517
You know. I went off to
L.A. and I didn't look back.

1224
01:35:33.686 --> 01:35:35.271
I left them in the dust.

1225
01:35:39.984 --> 01:35:41.610
I am so sorry. gentlemen.

1226
01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:45.990
You deserve much
better than that.

1227
01:35:48.951 --> 01:35:50.661
Please remember that I love you.

1228
01:35:55.624 --> 01:35:59.795
You know. we had a whole lot
more show planned for you.

1229
01:36:01.839 --> 01:36:04.633
But I've. I have to ask
a favor of these guys.

1230
01:36:08.971 --> 01:36:11.182
We had a whole lot
more show planned.

1231
01:36:12.141 --> 01:36:14.560
But I. I can't do it.

1232
01:36:16.061 --> 01:36:17.646
I got one more in me.

1233
01:36:19.356 --> 01:36:20.357
That's about all.

1234
01:36:24.195 --> 01:36:25.988
- What song do you
want to end with. Roxy?

1235
01:36:27.198 --> 01:36:29.074
- A song we wrote
about 30 years ago.

1236
01:36:30.075 --> 01:36:31.660
"Waiting in the Wings".

1237
01:36:34.163 --> 01:36:36.499
- I don't think we've played
that song in 30 years.

1238
01:36:38.167 --> 01:36:39.335
- It's the way we began.

1239
01:36:42.546 --> 01:36:43.756
It's the way we should end.

1240
01:36:49.011 --> 01:36:50.596
Somebody remembers.

1241
01:41:49.311 --> 01:41:52.147
- She'll reach
the people. believe me.

1242
01:41:52.147 --> 01:41:54.316
She will reach the people.
