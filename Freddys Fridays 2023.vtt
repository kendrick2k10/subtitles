3
00:00:26.094 --> 00:00:31.165
Yeah. I'm the
same lot.

4
00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:54.188
Mm. that sound.

5
00:00:56.124 --> 00:00:57.725
Not here. not here.

6
00:00:57.725 --> 00:00:59.927
It's just a little farther.

7
00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:03.631
- Come on. big boy. I want you.

8
00:01:03.631 --> 00:01:07.268
There's far. there's
too may people about.

9
00:01:07.268 --> 00:01:09.837
- Exactly. it's Friday.

10
00:01:09.837 --> 00:01:11.972
It's time to get naughty.

11
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.795
You feel like you're ready.

12
00:01:47.608 --> 00:01:49.443
Look. just five
more minutes. okay?

13
00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:50.744
Five more. okay?

14
00:01:51.812 --> 00:01:54.047
Five more then we're there.

15
00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:53.207
I've been in worse places.

16
00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:21.802
Come on. baby.
let's get started.

17
00:03:29.277 --> 00:03:32.112
What's the rush?

18
00:03:32.112 --> 00:03:35.349
There. there's still
some Friday left.

19
00:03:45.158 --> 00:03:48.729
Hmm. how romantic. baby.

20
00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:49.763
- Todd.

21
00:03:49.763 --> 00:03:50.864
My name's Todd.

22
00:03:53.701 --> 00:03:55.469
- I know. baby.

23
00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:56.270
I remember.

24
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.890
What's this?

25
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.793
You gonna read me some poetry

26
00:04:19.793 --> 00:04:22.530
or is this some
kinky Kama Sutra?

27
00:04:23.664 --> 00:04:27.335
Actually I'd like
you to read for me.

28
00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:34.007
Start reading.

29
00:04:39.046 --> 00:04:40.481
What is it?

30
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:41.982
German?

31
00:04:41.982 --> 00:04:43.150
It's actually Latin.

32
00:04:44.251 --> 00:04:45.786
It doesn't matter if
you can't read it.

33
00:04:45.786 --> 00:04:48.356
just. just sound it out. yeah?

34
00:04:51.492 --> 00:04:52.693
What does it mean?

35
00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:54.862
Look. I've paid for you

36
00:04:57.998 --> 00:05:01.602
and I owe you at least
until Friday's out.

37
00:05:01.602 --> 00:05:06.273
So will you just fucking read
the words please. please.

38
00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:22.456
Frederique.

39
00:05:57.224 --> 00:05:58.792
Did you like that?

40
00:06:02.896 --> 00:06:04.732
Did it make you hard?

41
00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.837
Did you want me
to read some more

42
00:06:09.837 --> 00:06:12.973
or do you want me to do
something else with my mouth?

43
00:06:43.236 --> 00:06:45.939
No.

44
00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:48.008
No. no. no. I'm scared.

45
00:06:49.042 --> 00:06:50.744
I'm scared.

46
00:06:50.744 --> 00:06:52.746
- Anastasia. Anastasia.

47
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:59.687
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

48
00:06:59.687 --> 00:07:02.022
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

49
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.218
No!

50
00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:08.622
Two.

51
00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:13.326
Two more.

52
00:08:24.872 --> 00:08:26.674
It's just not like her.

53
00:08:27.775 --> 00:08:30.010
Ana has never been
gone this long before.

54
00:08:34.314 --> 00:08:36.449
When was the last
time that you saw her?

55
00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:40.453
Last Friday.

56
00:08:42.489 --> 00:08:43.957
She was working.

57
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.161
Where does she work?

58
00:08:48.161 --> 00:08:49.062
What does she do?

59
00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.205
It's okay. Connie.
you can tell me.

60
00:08:59.306 --> 00:09:01.374
I'm gonna need us to
know as much as possible

61
00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:02.643
if I'm gonna help you.

62
00:09:08.849 --> 00:09:09.917
She's an escort.

63
00:09:11.484 --> 00:09:15.088
And she work independent
or of an agency?

64
00:09:15.088 --> 00:09:16.624
An agency.

65
00:09:16.624 --> 00:09:18.659
English Rose. I
think they're called.

66
00:09:22.229 --> 00:09:23.130
- Go on.

67
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:30.570
It's just she's the only
person who looks out for me.

68
00:09:31.739 --> 00:09:32.640
You know?

69
00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:39.479
Please. please. she's the
closest thing I have to family.

70
00:09:41.815 --> 00:09:43.116
She's like my sister.

71
00:09:45.485 --> 00:09:46.954
- I understand. Connie.

72
00:09:46.954 --> 00:09:49.422
I understand how difficult
this is for you. I really do.

73
00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:53.627
Look. I'm gonna do
everything I possibly can

74
00:09:53.627 --> 00:09:55.228
to help you find her. okay?

75
00:09:55.228 --> 00:09:56.129
- Okay.

76
00:09:57.665 --> 00:09:59.066
I think I've got
enough to go on here

77
00:09:59.066 --> 00:10:01.635
so if you do think of
anything else at all. Connie.

78
00:10:01.635 --> 00:10:03.737
that can help. you
give me a call. okay?

79
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.042
Did you say it was English Rose?

80
00:10:09.042 --> 00:10:14.114
- Yeah. I think they work above
a nail salon on West Street.

81
00:10:15.683 --> 00:10:17.517
- Oh. West Street. okay?

82
00:10:17.517 --> 00:10:20.320
Well I'm gonna look
into that for you. okay?

83
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:23.056
Come on. let's get you going.

84
00:10:24.792 --> 00:10:27.094
Anything we can to help
you find her. okay?

85
00:10:33.901 --> 00:10:35.002
Hey. you got a sec?

86
00:10:35.002 --> 00:10:36.503
- Chief.

87
00:10:36.503 --> 00:10:38.672
I've just been talking with
this young girl Connie.

88
00:10:38.672 --> 00:10:40.273
Her friend has gone missing

89
00:10:40.273 --> 00:10:42.242
and goes by the
name of Anastasia.

90
00:10:42.242 --> 00:10:44.745
She's the sixth girl to go
missing in as many weeks

91
00:10:44.745 --> 00:10:47.580
and it's the first one to
give her some information.

92
00:10:49.249 --> 00:10:51.785
Escort agency uptown.

93
00:10:51.785 --> 00:10:54.154
Look. I don't mean
to be dismissive.

94
00:10:54.154 --> 00:10:55.756
but she's probably
holed up somewhere

95
00:10:55.756 --> 00:10:58.158
with a needle in her arm
waiting for her next paycheck.

96
00:10:58.158 --> 00:11:00.093
Or she got tangled up
with the wrong guy.

97
00:11:00.093 --> 00:11:02.963
- So all escorts become
drug addicts now.

98
00:11:02.963 --> 00:11:04.664
is that what you're
saying. Chief?

99
00:11:04.664 --> 00:11:06.399
That's not what I'm saying.

100
00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:09.036
- She was asking for it.
got what she deserved.

101
00:11:09.837 --> 00:11:11.604
That is not what I'm saying.

102
00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:13.907
All I'm saying is these girls.

103
00:11:13.907 --> 00:11:16.676
they go missing
sometimes they come back.

104
00:11:16.676 --> 00:11:18.245
sometimes they don't.

105
00:11:18.245 --> 00:11:20.413
And a lot of them.
they live off the grid.

106
00:11:21.614 --> 00:11:23.650
- Well we. we don't get
to choose who matters

107
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:24.584
and who doesn't.

108
00:11:25.552 --> 00:11:26.754
Now I'm gonna look into this one

109
00:11:26.754 --> 00:11:29.222
and I will let you
know what transpires.

110
00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:32.259
If you care that is.

111
00:11:34.061 --> 00:11:35.628
I care.

112
00:11:35.628 --> 00:11:38.431
Look. I've seen a lot of this.

113
00:11:39.867 --> 00:11:41.134
Don't get your hopes up.

114
00:12:59.112 --> 00:12:59.913
Come on.

115
00:13:00.881 --> 00:13:02.983
Let's walk and talk.

116
00:13:02.983 --> 00:13:05.185
We'll go down here.

117
00:13:05.185 --> 00:13:07.554
Don't want any of my
more high profile clients

118
00:13:07.554 --> 00:13:09.589
seeing me liaising
with the detective.

119
00:13:10.723 --> 00:13:12.525
How did you know who I was?

120
00:13:12.525 --> 00:13:14.794
- Darling. I picked you
out from a mile off.

121
00:13:16.063 --> 00:13:18.365
The only thing that's missing
is the blues and twos.

122
00:13:18.365 --> 00:13:21.201
That and one of those hats
that makes you look like a tit.

123
00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:22.669
So about this girl.

124
00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:24.938
Not here.

125
00:13:30.177 --> 00:13:32.846
Right.

126
00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:34.681
Her name was Anastasia.

127
00:13:35.582 --> 00:13:37.150
Nice girl.

128
00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:40.387
Very pretty. very popular.

129
00:13:40.387 --> 00:13:41.388
Good little earner.

130
00:13:42.555 --> 00:13:46.026
Connie was a little
sister. lovely girl.

131
00:13:47.294 --> 00:13:50.097
Her and Anastasia lived
together a little flat in town.

132
00:13:51.464 --> 00:13:53.300
They arrived here a few years
back when their parents died

133
00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:54.701
and they needed to get out.

134
00:13:56.036 --> 00:13:58.738
Couldn't pass up the
opportunity for a better life.

135
00:13:58.738 --> 00:14:01.408
Anastasia was only doing
this for a couple of years.

136
00:14:01.408 --> 00:14:02.910
She wanted to get a real job.

137
00:14:04.011 --> 00:14:05.946
She was studying when
she wasn't working.

138
00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:07.180
All right.

139
00:14:07.180 --> 00:14:08.148
Something to do
with computers.

140
00:14:08.148 --> 00:14:09.049
I don't know.

141
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:12.219
So she wanted out.

142
00:14:12.219 --> 00:14:13.286
Can you blame her?

143
00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:16.256
It's not the best life.

144
00:14:16.256 --> 00:14:17.857
So why do you do it?

145
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:19.692
- Money.

146
00:14:21.929 --> 00:14:24.664
But doesn't it worry you
that things like this happen?

147
00:14:28.936 --> 00:14:31.171
Detective Lila.
can I call you Lila?

148
00:14:32.805 --> 00:14:34.674
Of course. Patricia.

149
00:14:34.674 --> 00:14:35.608
Can I call you Pat?

150
00:14:35.608 --> 00:14:37.010
No. you cannot.

151
00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.146
I'm not a hundred
years old just yet.

152
00:14:42.649 --> 00:14:44.117
I'm not gonna feel responsible

153
00:14:44.117 --> 00:14:46.419
when something like this
happens to one of my girls.

154
00:14:46.419 --> 00:14:49.256
Yes. my girls. that's
how I see them.

155
00:14:49.256 --> 00:14:51.191
Anastasia could just as
easily have gone missing

156
00:14:51.191 --> 00:14:53.360
off the street if she worked
at a local supermarket

157
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.296
or walking home from
the post office.

158
00:14:57.897 --> 00:15:00.133
World's a mean and nasty place.

159
00:15:01.534 --> 00:15:03.570
Sick men on every corner.

160
00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.005
We probably pass two
or three of the fuckers

161
00:15:05.005 --> 00:15:06.039
on our walk alone.

162
00:15:07.407 --> 00:15:08.908
But don't you think a job
like this makes it more likely

163
00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.877
that they're gonna
come to bad end?

164
00:15:10.877 --> 00:15:11.778
Possibly.

165
00:15:13.613 --> 00:15:16.883
But a lot of these girls
don't have anything else.

166
00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:18.385
Maybe they're here illegally

167
00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:20.853
just trying to get enough
money to settle down.

168
00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:22.689
Maybe have someone
that relies on them.

169
00:15:22.689 --> 00:15:24.124
like Connie for example.

170
00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:29.562
Or maybe just maybe
they enjoy their job.

171
00:15:30.797 --> 00:15:34.401
Oh yes. Lila.
women like to fuck too.

172
00:15:34.401 --> 00:15:37.537
- I. you don't have to tell me.

173
00:15:37.537 --> 00:15:40.740
The lady right
here likes to fuck.

174
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:45.178
just not with some sleazy man
who can't get a real date.

175
00:15:45.178 --> 00:15:46.646
Oh. you'd be surprised.

176
00:15:47.747 --> 00:15:49.749
A lot of our men
are very handsome.

177
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:52.986
very wealthy who's very busy.

178
00:15:52.986 --> 00:15:55.755
They don't have time
for a real relationship.

179
00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:58.191
Or maybe they're
married and their wives

180
00:15:58.191 --> 00:15:59.126
don't put out anymore.

181
00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:00.460
Mm.

182
00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:01.761
Sound like jammers.

183
00:16:03.063 --> 00:16:05.632
Listen. do you keep a record
of who the girls meet?

184
00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.034
- Of course I do.
- Yeah.

185
00:16:07.034 --> 00:16:08.435
- You never know when
it's gonna come in handy

186
00:16:08.435 --> 00:16:10.170
knowing who my
girls are meeting.

187
00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:15.908
Well. you might not
wanna talk about extortion

188
00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:17.044
with a police officer.

189
00:16:17.044 --> 00:16:19.246
Just a little warning.

190
00:16:19.246 --> 00:16:20.213
What can I say?

191
00:16:21.114 --> 00:16:22.482
You got a trusting face.

192
00:16:23.783 --> 00:16:26.353
That being said. you
could make a lot of money

193
00:16:26.353 --> 00:16:27.387
in my line of work.

194
00:16:28.421 --> 00:16:29.889
I'll pass. thanks.

195
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:33.560
So who was Anastasia
with last Friday?

196
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.328
Some yuppie prick.

197
00:16:35.328 --> 00:16:36.863
Something to do in
the stock market.

198
00:16:36.863 --> 00:16:39.999
You know the type more coke
in their system than blood.

199
00:16:41.634 --> 00:16:42.835
Does he have a name?

200
00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:44.804
Has he used the agency before?

201
00:16:44.804 --> 00:16:45.872
Todd Fisher.

202
00:16:47.274 --> 00:16:49.142
Never used us before.

203
00:16:49.142 --> 00:16:50.577
Never will again. I
can tell you that.

204
00:16:50.577 --> 00:16:51.778
- Todd.

205
00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:53.513
Well. if he does
make contact again.

206
00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:55.882
you'll be sure to call me. okay?

207
00:16:55.882 --> 00:16:58.151
If he makes contact again.
you don't have to worry.

208
00:16:58.151 --> 00:16:59.919
I'll chop his
ballocks off myself.

209
00:17:01.454 --> 00:17:03.390
Gotta remind you
who you're talking to.

210
00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:07.594
Don't worry sweetheart. if
I did it. you'd never find me.

211
00:17:10.763 --> 00:17:13.900
Anyway. if that's
everything then I'll be off.

212
00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.668
There's actually
one more thing.

213
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:17.970
Look I probably
shouldn't show you this.

214
00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.273
but do you recognize this girl?

215
00:17:25.578 --> 00:17:27.013
I know I shouldn't show
you these pictures.

216
00:17:27.013 --> 00:17:30.383
but Anastasia is the
sixth girl to go missing.

217
00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:34.121
The other five.
they've turned up dead.

218
00:17:34.121 --> 00:17:35.622
And I'm sorry to say.

219
00:17:35.622 --> 00:17:38.057
I don't see anything else
happening to Anastasia.

220
00:17:39.426 --> 00:17:42.229
I'm pretty sure that we are
gonna find her body soon.

221
00:17:42.229 --> 00:17:46.533
Look. these poor girls that we
know. nothing of these girls.

222
00:17:47.934 --> 00:17:49.202
No one's come forward.

223
00:17:52.472 --> 00:17:55.108
Look. do you recognize
any of these girls?

224
00:17:55.108 --> 00:17:57.877
Any girls gone missing
from your agency?

225
00:17:57.877 --> 00:18:00.813
Darling. girls go
missing all the time.

226
00:18:00.813 --> 00:18:02.782
Doesn't mean they're
missing missing.

227
00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:05.051
Some of 'em just move on.

228
00:18:05.051 --> 00:18:07.187
Some of them are nomads.

229
00:18:07.187 --> 00:18:09.356
We don't exactly
have a HR department.

230
00:18:11.724 --> 00:18:13.860
but I don't recognize
any of those girls.

231
00:18:15.195 --> 00:18:17.096
Not that it's easy to with
their faces like that.

232
00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:17.997
- Sorry.

233
00:18:19.098 --> 00:18:19.966
Okay.

234
00:18:22.935 --> 00:18:24.171
Thanks for your help.

235
00:18:24.171 --> 00:18:25.672
Honestly. I do appreciate it.

236
00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:27.674
And Connie will too.

237
00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:31.178
- Just find my girl. sweetheart.

238
00:18:31.178 --> 00:18:34.214
And if she's hurt.
make the bastard pay.

239
00:18:43.223 --> 00:18:45.358
I don't know about
this one. babe.

240
00:18:45.358 --> 00:18:46.926
I don't want you getting
involved in this.

241
00:18:46.926 --> 00:18:49.962
I mean. what six
girls already missing.

242
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:52.799
I don't want you
to be number seven.

243
00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.168
I'm not a princess. John.

244
00:18:55.168 --> 00:18:56.236
This is my job.

245
00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.608
And like if I can track this
guy. then maybe I can stop him.

246
00:19:01.608 --> 00:19:03.343
- You don't even know it's him.

247
00:19:03.343 --> 00:19:05.245
I mean just because he
took her out that night.

248
00:19:05.245 --> 00:19:08.348
that doesn't make him the reason
that she didn't come home.

249
00:19:08.348 --> 00:19:10.350
Maybe she just skipped out.

250
00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.851
Well. in that case.

251
00:19:11.851 --> 00:19:13.953
he's gonna have fuck all
to worry about then is he?

252
00:19:16.256 --> 00:19:17.757
Well. she wouldn't
have skipped out

253
00:19:17.757 --> 00:19:21.528
'cause she's got a sister or
like her sister the girl said.

254
00:19:23.296 --> 00:19:24.997
Is that what
this is all about?

255
00:19:26.466 --> 00:19:27.367
- What?

256
00:19:28.701 --> 00:19:30.403
Finding these girls.

257
00:19:31.438 --> 00:19:33.039
It's not gonna bring Sarah back.

258
00:19:33.039 --> 00:19:33.973
She's.

259
00:19:33.973 --> 00:19:36.209
Don't John. don't do this.

260
00:19:36.209 --> 00:19:38.611
No. I'm just saying.

261
00:19:38.611 --> 00:19:40.680
I know this one might
hit close to home.

262
00:19:42.715 --> 00:19:44.484
Don't bring my
sister into this.

263
00:19:48.688 --> 00:19:51.190
The fact that Sarah was
taken when you were a kid.

264
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:52.859
I shouldn't be the reason
that you run headfirst

265
00:19:52.859 --> 00:19:55.428
into danger all the time.

266
00:19:55.428 --> 00:19:56.929
I'm just trying to.

267
00:19:58.030 --> 00:19:59.399
I need some time alone.

268
00:20:01.601 --> 00:20:02.502
- But I.

269
00:20:06.839 --> 00:20:09.276
Okay. all right.

270
00:20:13.446 --> 00:20:15.315
I'm just trying to
look out for you.

271
00:20:22.889 --> 00:20:25.157
I never liked him anyway.

272
00:20:25.157 --> 00:20:28.295
You know he never likes
any of my Instagram posts.

273
00:20:28.295 --> 00:20:29.529
Not even the ones from Bali

274
00:20:29.529 --> 00:20:31.063
when I'm sat on that
trained cute elephant.

275
00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:31.964
It's like. what
more do you want?

276
00:20:31.964 --> 00:20:33.232
Do you know what I mean?

277
00:20:34.834 --> 00:20:36.336
He knows that's my
livelihood. right?

278
00:20:36.336 --> 00:20:38.305
The more likes I get.
the more sponsored I get.

279
00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:40.573
I know Jess. you've
told me before.

280
00:20:41.741 --> 00:20:44.477
- Aw. you can do better
than him. you know?

281
00:20:44.477 --> 00:20:46.045
Don't need a man
telling you when you can

282
00:20:46.045 --> 00:20:47.314
and can't run into danger.

283
00:20:48.515 --> 00:20:49.882
That's what your
best friends for.

284
00:20:51.318 --> 00:20:53.453
Do you want me to shit on
him some more or are we good?

285
00:20:55.588 --> 00:20:56.623
We're good.

286
00:20:58.157 --> 00:20:59.892
I know he just cares about me.

287
00:21:01.828 --> 00:21:04.030
I'll call him later.

288
00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:05.765
- Okay. well if you do.

289
00:21:05.765 --> 00:21:08.335
tell him to start
liking my fucking posts

290
00:21:08.335 --> 00:21:10.637
or at least follow my podcast.

291
00:21:10.637 --> 00:21:13.205
Yes. Jess. I will do
all of those things.

292
00:21:15.074 --> 00:21:17.109
Talk about being my best
friend and all that.

293
00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.210
Hmm.

294
00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.279
Oh rather. my only friend.

295
00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:24.150
Look. I might need your
expertise on something.

296
00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:25.918
Oh. you need me to stalk
someone online for you.

297
00:21:25.918 --> 00:21:26.753
don't you?

298
00:21:26.753 --> 00:21:27.587
Who is it?

299
00:21:27.587 --> 00:21:28.821
Is it an ex?

300
00:21:28.821 --> 00:21:30.056
Oh that's my girl.
forget about Johnny.

301
00:21:30.056 --> 00:21:32.359
you are a strong
independent woman.

302
00:21:32.359 --> 00:21:33.993
- Oh. calm down.

303
00:21:33.993 --> 00:21:35.528
No. it's not an ex.

304
00:21:35.528 --> 00:21:38.665
I do want you to look up
someone online for me though.

305
00:21:38.665 --> 00:21:40.367
A suspect.

306
00:21:40.367 --> 00:21:43.436
- Okay. well if it's a suspect.

307
00:21:43.436 --> 00:21:45.304
does that make me an
honorary detective?

308
00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:46.806
Oh. do I get a badge?

309
00:21:46.806 --> 00:21:49.241
No. it doesn't make you
an honorary detective.

310
00:21:49.241 --> 00:21:50.910
but I do need you to
look someone up for me.

311
00:21:50.910 --> 00:21:54.581
All I can find so far is a
couple of minor drug offenses.

312
00:21:54.581 --> 00:21:56.282
pissing on a fence.

313
00:21:56.282 --> 00:21:57.950
But I need to find
more about him.

314
00:21:57.950 --> 00:22:01.187
And I thought. you know.
you and social media.

315
00:22:01.187 --> 00:22:03.122
maybe you could have a
little look online for me.

316
00:22:03.122 --> 00:22:04.724
Absolutely babe.

317
00:22:04.724 --> 00:22:08.127
Time to watch a master at work.

318
00:22:08.127 --> 00:22:10.363
Right. all I need is a name.

319
00:22:15.134 --> 00:22:16.068
Six.

320
00:22:16.068 --> 00:22:18.538
Six. oh. why can't that be?

321
00:22:18.538 --> 00:22:19.439
Six.

322
00:22:21.007 --> 00:22:23.075
I can't do this anymore.

323
00:22:25.878 --> 00:22:27.514
Two more. two more.

324
00:22:28.781 --> 00:22:29.949
You got this.

325
00:22:34.621 --> 00:22:37.457
Just leave me alone. please.

326
00:22:37.457 --> 00:22:38.758
Leave me alone.

327
00:22:56.242 --> 00:22:57.209
Need a girl.

328
00:22:58.911 --> 00:22:59.712
Tonight.

329
00:23:05.552 --> 00:23:09.489
- Okay. Jess. you are a genius.

330
00:23:09.489 --> 00:23:10.389
- Yeah. I know.

331
00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:14.927
All right. so this guy is a
stockbroker from South London.

332
00:23:14.927 --> 00:23:17.664
Couple of drugs.
priors. nothing much.

333
00:23:17.664 --> 00:23:21.468
a string of no doubt
disappointed sexual partners.

334
00:23:22.401 --> 00:23:24.637
And until. till very recently

335
00:23:24.637 --> 00:23:26.673
like zero luck on
the stock market.

336
00:23:27.774 --> 00:23:31.644
But now all of a sudden
his luck is changing.

337
00:23:33.613 --> 00:23:35.081
Money is rolling in.

338
00:23:36.215 --> 00:23:37.984
I mean how can you go
from having zero luck

339
00:23:37.984 --> 00:23:39.919
to practically
winning the lottery?

340
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:42.321
Good at his job. I guess.

341
00:23:43.322 --> 00:23:44.657
That's good.

342
00:23:44.657 --> 00:23:46.526
I mean. look back here

343
00:23:46.526 --> 00:23:49.295
this guy looks like he can
barely afford a happy meal.

344
00:23:49.295 --> 00:23:50.229
Now what?

345
00:23:50.229 --> 00:23:51.631
He's driving sports cars.

346
00:23:51.631 --> 00:23:54.601
Uh-uh. something
doesn't ring true here.

347
00:23:55.568 --> 00:23:56.869
Insider trading.

348
00:23:59.305 --> 00:24:01.073
Insider trading.

349
00:24:01.073 --> 00:24:02.308
Yeah. like tips and shit.

350
00:24:02.308 --> 00:24:03.876
Yeah. I know what it is.

351
00:24:04.977 --> 00:24:07.614
I just didn't think
you would. no offense.

352
00:24:07.614 --> 00:24:09.549
Uh. well I am
offended actually.

353
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:11.818
I do watch "Billions" you know?

354
00:24:11.818 --> 00:24:13.352
You know Damian Lewis is fit.

355
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:15.321
- He's not bad.

356
00:24:16.422 --> 00:24:17.690
What I wanna know is
if we can work out

357
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:20.126
where this guy is
gonna go tonight

358
00:24:20.126 --> 00:24:23.129
'cause judging by his Instagram.

359
00:24:23.129 --> 00:24:25.164
he goes out every Friday night.

360
00:24:25.164 --> 00:24:27.967
Oh well actually
now you mention it.

361
00:24:27.967 --> 00:24:31.671
he is out tonight
at Clara Bells.

362
00:24:31.671 --> 00:24:32.639
Clara Bells.

363
00:24:32.639 --> 00:24:33.540
- Yeah.

364
00:24:34.674 --> 00:24:37.276
Isn't that that like
exclusive kinky place?

365
00:24:37.276 --> 00:24:39.145
Mm-hmm.

366
00:24:39.145 --> 00:24:41.080
Do you wanna use
my membership card?

367
00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:50.056
You never told me at a
membership at Clara Bells.

368
00:24:50.056 --> 00:24:51.524
Didn't think it
was your thing.

369
00:24:51.524 --> 00:24:55.762
It's not my thing. but this
could be very interesting.

370
00:24:55.762 --> 00:24:57.564
Yeah. well they gave
me a membership card

371
00:24:57.564 --> 00:25:00.867
after I've gotten like 20.000
likes on one of their posts.

372
00:25:03.469 --> 00:25:04.571
Clara Bells.

373
00:25:07.206 --> 00:25:08.875
It's not a normal club. is that?

374
00:25:09.809 --> 00:25:12.178
No. it's hard to explain.

375
00:25:12.178 --> 00:25:17.249
but it's just like people
standing around talking.

376
00:25:19.952 --> 00:25:23.389
like music drinks.
just. you know.

377
00:25:24.791 --> 00:25:27.159
the high members of society
rubbing shoulders together.

378
00:25:27.159 --> 00:25:28.861
And they gave
you a membership.

379
00:25:29.896 --> 00:25:32.031
- I'm very influential.
have you know.

380
00:25:32.031 --> 00:25:34.366
I'm sure you are. right.

381
00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:37.837
Okay. Clara Bells it is.

382
00:25:41.007 --> 00:25:42.575
Well you
can't go like that.

383
00:25:44.577 --> 00:25:45.544
No. no. no. no.

384
00:25:49.849 --> 00:25:51.718
I'm gonna need
your help aren't I?

385
00:25:52.585 --> 00:25:53.485
- Yeah.

386
00:26:14.006 --> 00:26:15.374
Thank you. Jess.

387
00:26:22.114 --> 00:26:23.449
Gin and orange.

388
00:26:24.617 --> 00:26:25.818
All right.

389
00:26:25.818 --> 00:26:27.553
Hello. gorgeous.

390
00:26:27.553 --> 00:26:29.021
Seen you here before?

391
00:26:29.956 --> 00:26:30.957
Yes. first time.

392
00:26:32.825 --> 00:26:33.893
My name's William.

393
00:26:34.994 --> 00:26:39.198
and people. mostly women
call me Big Willie.

394
00:26:43.435 --> 00:26:45.004
Listen. I'm meeting
someone here. Willie.

395
00:26:45.004 --> 00:26:48.240
so I don't think they're
gonna be too happy seeing me

396
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.845
chatting to somebody.
so affective.

397
00:26:52.845 --> 00:26:54.180
so I'm gonna have to decline

398
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:57.283
that oh-so tempting
offer of yours. Willie.

399
00:26:59.251 --> 00:27:00.753
No probs.

400
00:27:00.753 --> 00:27:02.955
Big Willie doesn't shit
on another man's doorstep.

401
00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:08.861
- Oh my God.
- Oh.

402
00:27:08.861 --> 00:27:09.696
Oh.

403
00:27:09.696 --> 00:27:11.263
I'm so sorry.

404
00:27:11.263 --> 00:27:12.899
- Oh.
- Look here. here.

405
00:27:12.899 --> 00:27:14.433
Let me get you another drink.

406
00:27:14.433 --> 00:27:15.935
It's fine. don't worry.

407
00:27:17.303 --> 00:27:21.107
- My name is Hugo and I.
and I work in banking.

408
00:27:24.643 --> 00:27:26.112
And you are?

409
00:27:26.112 --> 00:27:27.579
Not interested.

410
00:27:41.828 --> 00:27:43.262
- Hello. beautiful.
- Oh.

411
00:27:43.262 --> 00:27:44.563
Never seen you here before.

412
00:27:44.563 --> 00:27:46.065
- First time.
- How are you tonight?

413
00:27:46.065 --> 00:27:48.067
Yeah. I'm meeting
someone else.

414
00:27:48.935 --> 00:27:50.036
Love one of us?

415
00:27:50.036 --> 00:27:51.838
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

416
00:27:51.838 --> 00:27:52.705
No. come on.

417
00:27:54.173 --> 00:27:55.441
Thank you.

418
00:27:55.441 --> 00:27:57.710
And who the fuck are you?

419
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:59.011
You come in here all
pretty and dressed up.

420
00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:00.512
do you know who I am?

421
00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:01.981
Get the fuck outta here. bitch.

422
00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:05.384
Yeah. mm-hmm. keep
struggling. that's great.

423
00:28:05.384 --> 00:28:06.285
Beautiful.

424
00:28:07.486 --> 00:28:08.788
I need a drink.

425
00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:38.084
Come on darling. I
really to see your place.

426
00:30:44.010 --> 00:30:47.846
This is the ugliest thing
I think I've ever seen.

427
00:30:50.449 --> 00:30:55.421
Family heirlooms. I couldn't
bear to get rid of 'em.

428
00:30:56.588 --> 00:30:58.557
You should cover
them up or something.

429
00:30:58.557 --> 00:31:01.860
Unless it turns you
on letting 'em watch.

430
00:31:06.132 --> 00:31:07.599
Know what does turn me on?

431
00:31:10.970 --> 00:31:12.171
Hearing a bit of Latin.

432
00:31:13.139 --> 00:31:14.106
I might like that.

433
00:31:19.011 --> 00:31:20.412
This passage in particular.

434
00:31:26.685 --> 00:31:28.554
I don't speak Latin.

435
00:31:28.554 --> 00:31:30.356
You don't need
to understand it.

436
00:31:30.356 --> 00:31:33.425
Just sound it out like
a. like a child reading.

437
00:31:35.327 --> 00:31:36.328
Really?

438
00:31:36.328 --> 00:31:37.763
- Yeah.

439
00:31:37.763 --> 00:31:40.232
Really gets my motor running.

440
00:31:42.034 --> 00:31:42.834
- Okay.

441
00:31:44.436 --> 00:31:46.138
Freaky Friday indeed.

442
00:31:48.274 --> 00:31:51.643
If that's what you
want.

443
00:31:55.081 --> 00:31:55.982
Here we go.

444
00:31:58.084 --> 00:31:59.351
I'm going to sound so-

445
00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:01.988
- Just read it you
dirty fucking slag!

446
00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.075
- Is that okay?

447
00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:25.011
Perfect.

448
00:32:45.998 --> 00:32:48.400
What the fuck is going on?

449
00:32:49.501 --> 00:32:52.238
Please.

450
00:32:52.238 --> 00:32:54.140
Please let me go.

451
00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.241
You can keep the money.

452
00:32:55.241 --> 00:32:56.808
I don't care.

453
00:32:56.808 --> 00:32:58.077
Please.

454
00:32:58.077 --> 00:33:02.614
I just wanna see my
daughter.

455
00:33:17.029 --> 00:33:20.199
Please don't hurt
me. please. please.

456
00:33:20.999 --> 00:33:23.402
No.

457
00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:30.176
Please. please.

458
00:33:31.643 --> 00:33:35.881
Please. don't. please!

459
00:34:46.452 --> 00:34:47.353
One.

460
00:34:48.554 --> 00:34:50.789
One more time next Friday.

461
00:36:43.502 --> 00:36:44.736
What's this?

462
00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:48.166
There's been another
murder. John.

463
00:37:48.166 --> 00:37:49.768
at least I think there is.

464
00:37:49.768 --> 00:37:52.170
And I know who it was
'cause I followed him.

465
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:54.606
Lila. why alone?

466
00:37:55.941 --> 00:37:56.775
Why would you do
something like that?

467
00:37:56.775 --> 00:37:58.143
Are. are you okay?

468
00:37:58.143 --> 00:37:59.745
I think that this
is something more

469
00:37:59.745 --> 00:38:01.079
than just a serial killer. John.

470
00:38:01.079 --> 00:38:02.748
I think this might be satanic.

471
00:38:02.748 --> 00:38:04.282
I found this book.

472
00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:07.719
Yeah. I. I can't believe I
let you bring that in the car.

473
00:38:07.719 --> 00:38:09.154
Is that actual skin?

474
00:38:09.154 --> 00:38:11.189
I don't know. I think so.

475
00:38:11.189 --> 00:38:14.593
Look. I mean I started to
read some of it at the club.

476
00:38:14.593 --> 00:38:16.862
but it's just oh. oh it just.

477
00:38:16.862 --> 00:38:20.165
I freaked out so
I just. just left.

478
00:38:20.165 --> 00:38:22.000
Thank you.

479
00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.602
Hey. you don't
have to thank me.

480
00:38:23.602 --> 00:38:24.736
I'll always be
there for you. okay?

481
00:38:24.736 --> 00:38:25.937
No matter what.

482
00:38:25.937 --> 00:38:27.373
And Satan couldn't stop me.

483
00:38:29.207 --> 00:38:31.343
So what's in there?

484
00:38:31.343 --> 00:38:33.645
Hey guys. what's going on?

485
00:38:33.645 --> 00:38:35.013
Oh. we're doing some
more investigating.

486
00:38:35.013 --> 00:38:36.715
- Well.
- Do my Googling skills again?

487
00:38:36.715 --> 00:38:39.518
- Mm.
- How was the club?

488
00:38:39.518 --> 00:38:41.753
Wait. you knew she went?

489
00:38:42.854 --> 00:38:44.122
Why didn't you go with her

490
00:38:44.122 --> 00:38:46.091
or. or talk her out
of it or something?

491
00:38:46.091 --> 00:38:47.593
Because she's an
independent person

492
00:38:47.593 --> 00:38:49.761
and doesn't need a
permission slip to go places.

493
00:38:49.761 --> 00:38:51.162
- Yeah.
- Is that okay with you?

494
00:38:51.162 --> 00:38:52.230
Yeah?

495
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:54.299
Guys. guys. please.

496
00:38:54.299 --> 00:38:56.034
Got missing girls here.

497
00:38:56.034 --> 00:38:57.636
Right. yeah. sorry.

498
00:38:57.636 --> 00:38:59.337
- But I don't know what
the fuck all this is.

499
00:38:59.337 --> 00:39:02.073
It's just in symbols and Latin.

500
00:39:02.073 --> 00:39:05.343
And I started to read
some out in the club

501
00:39:05.343 --> 00:39:07.946
and. oh. I don't know. it
just. it felt important

502
00:39:07.946 --> 00:39:09.981
so I just took it.

503
00:39:11.316 --> 00:39:12.751
Shouldn't we.
um. call your boss-

504
00:39:12.751 --> 00:39:13.919
- Wait.
- Or something?

505
00:39:13.919 --> 00:39:14.720
- Wait. no. wait.
- Especially

506
00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:15.253
there's been a murder.

507
00:39:15.253 --> 00:39:16.154
- Yeah.

508
00:39:17.222 --> 00:39:19.425
I mean. did you just
leave the body or?

509
00:39:20.759 --> 00:39:23.862
Well. technically
there wasn't a body.

510
00:39:25.397 --> 00:39:27.165
Then how do you know
there's been a murder?

511
00:39:27.165 --> 00:39:28.467
Because there was blood.

512
00:39:28.467 --> 00:39:30.168
Look. tons of it.

513
00:39:31.236 --> 00:39:32.270
Shouldn't we
call in the troops

514
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:34.606
and go and arrest this guy then?

515
00:39:36.174 --> 00:39:38.009
Call in the troops.

516
00:39:38.009 --> 00:39:40.311
Oh. call in the troopies.

517
00:39:40.311 --> 00:39:41.880
I'm an artist. not
a police officer.

518
00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:44.716
- Sorry.
- But should arrest him.

519
00:39:46.084 --> 00:39:48.286
Well look. technically we
don't have much to go on.

520
00:39:48.286 --> 00:39:50.088
Right now it's just
some missing girls.

521
00:39:50.088 --> 00:39:54.426
who all be hookers so
nobody seems to care.

522
00:39:55.527 --> 00:39:57.062
And this guy. what
he's been with.

523
00:39:57.062 --> 00:39:58.630
at least two of the girls.

524
00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:01.199
but then so has
countless other guys.

525
00:40:02.568 --> 00:40:04.736
And then there's the fact that
he's rich. albeit recently.

526
00:40:04.736 --> 00:40:06.204
And he could just pay
for a top notch lawyer

527
00:40:06.204 --> 00:40:07.739
to get him back on
the street in no time

528
00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:11.743
so it's just. I
need something more.

529
00:40:13.712 --> 00:40:15.346
Or catch him at it.

530
00:40:19.785 --> 00:40:24.656
Look. your deepest desires
will all be fulfilled

531
00:40:24.656 --> 00:40:27.693
when the blood of eight
is willingly spilled.

532
00:40:27.693 --> 00:40:29.661
but only off on the fifth day

533
00:40:29.661 --> 00:40:32.030
or Frederique will
be here to stay.

534
00:40:33.331 --> 00:40:34.232
Frederique?

535
00:40:35.366 --> 00:40:39.370
Wait. wait. this all
happens on Friday.

536
00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:43.374
The fifth day when the blood
of eight is willingly spilled.

537
00:40:45.511 --> 00:40:47.879
Tonight was the seventh
girl to go missing.

538
00:40:49.447 --> 00:40:50.982
You think there's one more?

539
00:40:50.982 --> 00:40:52.518
Yeah. I do.

540
00:40:54.119 --> 00:40:58.557
This one's marked
Frederique.

541
00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:10.201
What the fuck does that mean?

542
00:41:10.201 --> 00:41:11.402
Who the fuck knows?

543
00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:12.671
I'm too tired to
even think about it.

544
00:41:12.671 --> 00:41:15.206
Now what I'm gonna do
is I'm gonna take this

545
00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:16.141
all to my boss tomorrow.

546
00:41:16.141 --> 00:41:17.843
But right now I need sleep.

547
00:41:19.678 --> 00:41:21.079
It's 11 o'clock.

548
00:41:22.848 --> 00:41:24.182
You gonna stay?

549
00:41:24.182 --> 00:41:25.483
No. no. I've. I've
gotta get going.

550
00:41:25.483 --> 00:41:26.552
I've got work to do.

551
00:41:28.019 --> 00:41:29.020
Yeah. here.

552
00:41:31.256 --> 00:41:32.791
Talk to your boss tomorrow.

553
00:41:33.625 --> 00:41:35.794
Try not to do anything stupid.

554
00:41:35.794 --> 00:41:37.462
- Scout's honor.

555
00:41:37.462 --> 00:41:38.530
Goodnight. Johnny.

556
00:41:41.767 --> 00:41:43.702
Right. I am going to bed.

557
00:41:46.304 --> 00:41:48.807
- Oh. what no research?

558
00:41:48.807 --> 00:41:51.376
No. look tomorrow
we work I promise.

559
00:41:51.376 --> 00:41:53.111
Look. this all
happens on a Friday.

560
00:41:53.111 --> 00:41:57.916
so nothing is gonna
happen until then.

561
00:41:57.916 --> 00:41:58.884
Come on. bed.

562
00:42:05.290 --> 00:42:07.458
Rachel. lights on.

563
00:42:10.729 --> 00:42:13.331
Rachel. turn on the lights.

564
00:42:17.769 --> 00:42:20.005
Rachel. fuck you.

565
00:42:31.149 --> 00:42:32.050
Brilliant.

566
00:42:33.351 --> 00:42:34.252
Just brilliant.

567
00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:36.688
That's exactly what I need.

568
00:43:53.732 --> 00:43:55.934
What. what the fuck?

569
00:43:55.934 --> 00:43:57.635
Who the fuck are you?

570
00:43:59.237 --> 00:44:00.371
Who the fuck are you?

571
00:44:06.511 --> 00:44:09.915
That is something I found
at a crime scene. sir.

572
00:44:09.915 --> 00:44:12.617
What I believe to be
involving those missing girls.

573
00:44:12.617 --> 00:44:13.651
- The prossies?

574
00:44:15.053 --> 00:44:16.554
Yes. sir.

575
00:44:16.554 --> 00:44:19.257
So I followed a suspect
to an abandoned warehouse

576
00:44:19.257 --> 00:44:20.225
with a girl.

577
00:44:21.226 --> 00:44:23.028
Did you see a crime scene?

578
00:44:23.028 --> 00:44:25.296
Did you see any dead bodies?

579
00:44:25.296 --> 00:44:26.798
No. sir. but that was.

580
00:44:26.798 --> 00:44:29.200
And did you see anybody
get killed or hurt even?

581
00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.401
- No sir. but there was-

582
00:44:30.401 --> 00:44:32.403
- Well it sounds like
a lot of nothing.

583
00:44:32.403 --> 00:44:35.807
- Sir. there was a lot of blood.

584
00:44:35.807 --> 00:44:38.109
Blood. an abandoned
warehouse. rats.

585
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:39.644
Yeah. not rats.

586
00:44:39.644 --> 00:44:41.112
Of course there was rats.
but there was also blood.

587
00:44:41.112 --> 00:44:43.514
- It does sound like you're
saying an awful lot of nothing.

588
00:44:43.514 --> 00:44:45.083
If you shut up for a minute.

589
00:44:46.918 --> 00:44:48.486
I'll be able to get a word in.

590
00:44:51.356 --> 00:44:53.058
Now. I
followed a suspect

591
00:44:53.058 --> 00:44:55.593
to an abandoned warehouse
and he was with Anastasia

592
00:44:55.593 --> 00:44:58.029
and he was the last one
to take Anastasia out

593
00:44:58.029 --> 00:45:00.231
before she went missing.

594
00:45:00.231 --> 00:45:01.199
And then this girl-

595
00:45:01.199 --> 00:45:02.768
- Like was she another hooker?

596
00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:05.971
Yes. sir.

597
00:45:07.272 --> 00:45:11.409
Anyway. so he and this
girl went to this warehouse

598
00:45:11.409 --> 00:45:13.411
and then they locked the door.
I couldn't get in. so then-

599
00:45:13.411 --> 00:45:15.613
- And that's when you
should have called for backup.

600
00:45:15.613 --> 00:45:17.348
I know. sir.

601
00:45:17.348 --> 00:45:18.850
But look. anyway.

602
00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:21.186
I went around the back trying
to find another way inside.

603
00:45:21.186 --> 00:45:22.720
And then I heard this
noise at the front.

604
00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:24.255
This door opens. people
come running out.

605
00:45:24.255 --> 00:45:26.324
so I go round to the
front. go in the door

606
00:45:26.324 --> 00:45:27.658
through the
warehouse to the back

607
00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:29.727
and there's this
room full of blood.

608
00:45:29.727 --> 00:45:33.731
dried blood and a big
pool of fresh blood.

609
00:45:33.731 --> 00:45:38.069
And also this table with lit
candles on and. and that book.

610
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:39.537
- Dolls.

611
00:45:39.537 --> 00:45:40.772
Yes. and dolls.

612
00:45:40.772 --> 00:45:41.739
But somebody had to
put them there. right?

613
00:45:41.739 --> 00:45:42.941
This dolls. these blood.

614
00:45:42.941 --> 00:45:44.342
they had to come from
somewhere. right?

615
00:45:44.342 --> 00:45:45.710
Look. it could
have been druggies.

616
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:47.078
It could have been winos.

617
00:45:47.078 --> 00:45:48.579
The sounds you heard

618
00:45:48.579 --> 00:45:51.016
were people running out
because you spooked them.

619
00:45:51.016 --> 00:45:52.617
No.

620
00:45:52.617 --> 00:45:53.518
No.

621
00:45:54.452 --> 00:45:56.521
This is ritualistic. sir.

622
00:45:56.521 --> 00:46:00.058
So you're saying that
this book and lit candles

623
00:46:00.058 --> 00:46:01.492
are what killed these prossies?

624
00:46:01.492 --> 00:46:03.528
No. yes. no. yes.

625
00:46:03.528 --> 00:46:06.731
I. all I'm saying is
that if this guy think

626
00:46:06.731 --> 00:46:10.001
that's what happened. then
that's all that matters.

627
00:46:10.001 --> 00:46:11.436
Right. okay.

628
00:46:11.436 --> 00:46:12.570
Who's the guy?

629
00:46:13.438 --> 00:46:14.973
Todd Fisher.

630
00:46:14.973 --> 00:46:17.075
He's some slimy
stockbroker type.

631
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:19.577
Well. I mean we. we could.

632
00:46:19.577 --> 00:46:20.745
we could bring him in and
we could question him.

633
00:46:20.745 --> 00:46:22.713
but we've got nothing
to hold him on.

634
00:46:22.713 --> 00:46:25.516
Any old lawyer's gonna
get him out in seconds.

635
00:46:25.516 --> 00:46:28.653
I don't think there's
any need for that service.

636
00:46:28.653 --> 00:46:30.555
Well. last night was
Friday. so nothing.

637
00:46:30.555 --> 00:46:32.057
we're gonna be safe

638
00:46:32.057 --> 00:46:33.791
'cause nothing is gonna
happen until next Friday.

639
00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:36.227
Why Friday?

640
00:46:36.227 --> 00:46:38.129
One sec. sorry. sir.

641
00:46:41.499 --> 00:46:42.400
Hello?

642
00:46:51.609 --> 00:46:52.944
I've got to go.

643
00:46:55.446 --> 00:46:56.381
Got an emergency crisis.

644
00:46:56.381 --> 00:46:58.116
I'm gonna have to call you back.

645
00:46:58.116 --> 00:47:00.485
Ma'am. ma'am. whoa. whoa.
whoa. whoa. whoa. whoa!

646
00:47:00.485 --> 00:47:03.088
Step back. step back right now.

647
00:47:04.722 --> 00:47:05.590
What's happened?

648
00:47:05.590 --> 00:47:06.457
Tell me what's happened?

649
00:47:06.457 --> 00:47:07.458
Tell me what's happened?

650
00:47:07.458 --> 00:47:10.361
- I'll tell you.
I will tell you.

651
00:47:10.361 --> 00:47:12.263
They cut off his head.

652
00:47:20.138 --> 00:47:21.372
You all right?

653
00:47:21.372 --> 00:47:23.441
Do. do you need me to
call someone. ma'am?

654
00:50:33.364 --> 00:50:35.933
- Lila. Lila. it's okay.
it's okay. it's okay.

655
00:50:35.933 --> 00:50:38.035
It's just a nightmare.
it's just nightmare.

656
00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:43.841
Oh God.

657
00:50:47.278 --> 00:50:48.579
What time is it?

658
00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:50.948
It's about 5:30. babe.

659
00:50:54.051 --> 00:50:54.852
What day?

660
00:50:56.087 --> 00:50:57.555
It's Sunday. babe.

661
00:51:00.258 --> 00:51:01.025
Six days.

662
00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:03.994
Six days till what?

663
00:51:10.067 --> 00:51:11.169
What are you doing?

664
00:51:12.537 --> 00:51:14.605
Oh. I was just trying
to do some more research.

665
00:51:16.006 --> 00:51:17.475
- Research what?

666
00:51:17.475 --> 00:51:22.247
This book. Frederique.

667
00:51:22.247 --> 00:51:24.782
No. no. no. no. no!

668
00:51:24.782 --> 00:51:27.118
What. what. what?

669
00:51:27.118 --> 00:51:29.320
Don't read anything
from inside this book.

670
00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.721
Nothing at all. do you hear me?

671
00:51:30.721 --> 00:51:32.157
- Not even one word.
- Okay. sorry. I'm sorry.

672
00:51:32.157 --> 00:51:33.224
Okay. sorry.

673
00:51:35.326 --> 00:51:38.095
I know. I know
you're trying to help.

674
00:51:38.095 --> 00:51:39.564
I do. I do appreciate it.

675
00:51:39.564 --> 00:51:43.000
But don't do anything
without telling me. okay?

676
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.702
Not before I ask.

677
00:51:44.702 --> 00:51:45.770
Okay. yeah.

678
00:51:49.039 --> 00:51:49.840
Sorry.

679
00:52:10.828 --> 00:52:12.497
Need to rest. babe.

680
00:52:13.731 --> 00:52:16.267
Resting comes after.

681
00:52:16.267 --> 00:52:18.169
After what?

682
00:52:18.169 --> 00:52:19.904
After we end this.

683
00:52:21.639 --> 00:52:22.807
Are you game?

684
00:52:23.874 --> 00:52:26.010
I'll put the kettle on.

685
00:52:32.116 --> 00:52:33.851
You all right. babe?

686
00:52:35.486 --> 00:52:36.387
- Yeah.

687
00:52:38.088 --> 00:52:39.357
Let me just get all
this straight. okay?

688
00:52:39.357 --> 00:52:42.260
So this. Frederique guy. he's a.

689
00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.895
he's an ancient demonic being.

690
00:52:44.895 --> 00:52:45.730
Yeah. he's a demon.

691
00:52:45.730 --> 00:52:47.365
Yeah.

692
00:52:47.365 --> 00:52:48.833
Who grants wishes.

693
00:52:48.833 --> 00:52:51.869
Well. not wishes exactly.

694
00:52:51.869 --> 00:52:53.738
Not a genie.

695
00:52:53.738 --> 00:52:56.307
He gives you shit. but
he wants stuff in return.

696
00:52:56.307 --> 00:52:58.843
You summon him using that
monstrosity over there.

697
00:52:59.810 --> 00:53:00.911
- Yeah. exactly.

698
00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.682
Once you summon old Freddy.
you better deliver otherwise.

699
00:53:05.616 --> 00:53:07.418
- You summon him using the book

700
00:53:07.418 --> 00:53:10.588
and here's what you see
pictures and everything.

701
00:53:12.089 --> 00:53:13.591
- Yeah.

702
00:53:13.591 --> 00:53:18.028
So says here. summon him using
the incarnation sacrifices.

703
00:53:20.731 --> 00:53:25.169
eight souls. riches. blah.
blah. blah. fifth day.

704
00:53:27.872 --> 00:53:28.773
Friday.

705
00:53:33.611 --> 00:53:34.912
Or Thursday.

706
00:53:34.912 --> 00:53:35.846
No. Friday.

707
00:53:35.846 --> 00:53:37.948
It's the fifth day Friday.

708
00:53:37.948 --> 00:53:41.085
Yeah. but some
calendars start on Sunday.

709
00:53:41.085 --> 00:53:42.520
Some calendars are wrong.

710
00:53:43.854 --> 00:53:46.591
Okay. all of these women have
gone missing on a Friday.

711
00:53:47.425 --> 00:53:50.127
Johnny and Johnny too.

712
00:53:51.596 --> 00:53:55.300
So let's just assume that
this all happens on a Friday.

713
00:53:57.935 --> 00:54:01.372
Uh. look babe.
you don't actually

714
00:54:01.372 --> 00:54:03.808
believe in all of this do you?

715
00:54:03.808 --> 00:54:06.243
Like demons and sacrifices.

716
00:54:06.243 --> 00:54:08.779
it's all of it out
there. isn't it?

717
00:54:08.779 --> 00:54:10.281
How else do you explain it?

718
00:54:12.983 --> 00:54:13.884
I can't.

719
00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:18.589
Let's just say for a
second that this is true.

720
00:54:18.589 --> 00:54:19.490
- Okay.

721
00:54:25.296 --> 00:54:26.931
- Is Johnny dead because of me?

722
00:54:26.931 --> 00:54:28.933
Oh. Lila. no. no.

723
00:54:30.234 --> 00:54:32.637
You can't think like that. okay?

724
00:54:32.637 --> 00:54:35.205
- I read the incantation
in the book and Johnny

725
00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:36.407
- read the Latin parts.
- It's not real.

726
00:54:36.407 --> 00:54:38.576
- So that means that
he's offered himself up.

727
00:54:38.576 --> 00:54:39.777
- It's not real.

728
00:54:41.045 --> 00:54:42.246
What does it say again?

729
00:54:42.246 --> 00:54:44.515
Tell me. tell me what
it translates to.

730
00:54:48.353 --> 00:54:51.922
Frederique. accept my
soul as an offering to thee.

731
00:54:51.922 --> 00:54:54.792
See. he's offered
himself up to Frederique.

732
00:54:54.792 --> 00:54:56.594
- Stop. okay. just stop.

733
00:54:57.662 --> 00:55:01.632
This is all a bit mental. okay?

734
00:55:01.632 --> 00:55:03.801
There's there's gonna be some

735
00:55:03.801 --> 00:55:07.104
normal rational explanation
for all of this. okay?

736
00:55:07.104 --> 00:55:08.906
It's just gonna be
like the local nutter

737
00:55:08.906 --> 00:55:10.908
or something. all right?

738
00:55:10.908 --> 00:55:13.310
Plus I read it and I'm
still alive and kicking.

739
00:55:15.145 --> 00:55:16.046
Okay?

740
00:55:18.783 --> 00:55:19.684
Yeah?

741
00:55:21.151 --> 00:55:22.687
Yeah. yeah. you're
probably right.

742
00:55:22.687 --> 00:55:23.788
Probably a nutter.

743
00:55:23.788 --> 00:55:24.789
Nutter yeah.

744
00:55:27.124 --> 00:55:30.027
But if this guy Todd
thinks that this is true.

745
00:55:30.027 --> 00:55:33.564
then well he's all
this information

746
00:55:33.564 --> 00:55:36.901
so we can understand
why he's doing this.

747
00:55:36.901 --> 00:55:38.302
- Yeah. I guess.

748
00:55:48.579 --> 00:55:50.681
This is not a good idea.

749
00:55:50.681 --> 00:55:53.183
I'm going on record
to say categorically.

750
00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:55.720
this is a bad fucking idea.

751
00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:57.422
I'm gonna be fine.

752
00:55:57.422 --> 00:55:58.923
Well. let me come
with you at least.

753
00:55:58.923 --> 00:56:00.124
Absolutely not.

754
00:56:00.124 --> 00:56:01.692
Let's. let's call
your boss then.

755
00:56:01.692 --> 00:56:03.027
Get some back up.

756
00:56:03.027 --> 00:56:05.763
No. he won't understand.

757
00:56:05.763 --> 00:56:08.332
And if he doesn't know.
then he can't stop me.

758
00:56:08.332 --> 00:56:11.035
Well. he'd be right.
Lila. this is idiotic.

759
00:56:11.035 --> 00:56:12.503
And if Johnny were here. he.

760
00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:17.542
- Well. Johnny's
not here. is he?

761
00:56:18.643 --> 00:56:19.877
And I'm the only one
that can stop this

762
00:56:19.877 --> 00:56:21.278
happening to anyone else.

763
00:56:22.279 --> 00:56:23.213
No. I know.

764
00:56:23.213 --> 00:56:26.383
I'm. I'm sorry. I just.

765
00:56:27.184 --> 00:56:28.586
I'm just scared.

766
00:56:30.555 --> 00:56:32.623
I know. but look.
I'm gonna be fine.

767
00:56:32.623 --> 00:56:35.626
I'm gonna take my car so
I've got a getaway this time.

768
00:56:35.626 --> 00:56:37.728
You're not fine
though. are you?

769
00:56:37.728 --> 00:56:40.264
I've heard you a week you
know. having nightmares.

770
00:56:40.264 --> 00:56:42.867
seeing things. shouting at
things that aren't there.

771
00:56:43.734 --> 00:56:45.002
You need some help. Lila.

772
00:56:45.002 --> 00:56:46.236
And you need to talk to someone.

773
00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:49.239
Even if. even if you
won't talk to me.

774
00:56:54.879 --> 00:56:57.648
I know that you don't
believe this and that's fine.

775
00:56:57.648 --> 00:56:59.617
Look. I will talk to
somebody. I'll grieve.

776
00:56:59.617 --> 00:57:01.686
and I'm gonna wallow in the
willies of the one that I love.

777
00:57:01.686 --> 00:57:03.788
but after tonight.

778
00:57:05.723 --> 00:57:10.595
I'm not gonna let Freddy
kill anybody else ever again.

779
00:57:11.796 --> 00:57:12.697
Okay?

780
00:57:19.136 --> 00:57:23.207
Oh. fuck sake.

781
00:57:27.745 --> 00:57:28.646
Drink this.

782
00:57:30.848 --> 00:57:32.617
Barman. two margaritas.

783
00:57:32.617 --> 00:57:34.084
And salt the rims. yeah?

784
00:57:34.084 --> 00:57:34.985
- Coming up.
- I'm just going

785
00:57:34.985 --> 00:57:36.253
to the toilet.

786
00:57:36.253 --> 00:57:39.890
Have a little taste of
that while I'm away.

787
00:57:50.901 --> 00:57:52.036
- Hey.
- Hey.

788
00:57:52.036 --> 00:57:53.504
You need to leave.

789
00:57:53.504 --> 00:57:54.505
Beg your pardon?

790
00:57:57.241 --> 00:57:58.609
I don't care what
you do with your body.

791
00:57:58.609 --> 00:58:01.011
The way I see it. your
body. your choice.

792
00:58:01.011 --> 00:58:05.616
But. but that guy you're
with he's bad news.

793
00:58:06.817 --> 00:58:07.752
You need to leave.

794
00:58:07.752 --> 00:58:09.419
How. how?

795
00:58:09.419 --> 00:58:10.921
He's gonna see me.

796
00:58:10.921 --> 00:58:12.489
Just get through the door.
down the stairs out the back.

797
00:58:12.489 --> 00:58:14.491
You're on the main
road. turn right.

798
00:58:14.491 --> 00:58:15.325
Just be careful.

799
00:58:15.325 --> 00:58:16.226
Go.

800
00:58:24.802 --> 00:58:25.803
Where's my woman?

801
00:58:28.305 --> 00:58:29.439
She went that way. mate.

802
00:58:29.439 --> 00:58:30.641
What's that?

803
00:58:30.641 --> 00:58:31.542
That way.

804
00:58:36.246 --> 00:58:38.883
- Sorry. I was
expecting someone else.

805
00:58:38.883 --> 00:58:41.686
No.

806
00:58:41.686 --> 00:58:43.187
Looks like you
found someone else.

807
00:58:43.187 --> 00:58:44.254
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

808
00:58:44.254 --> 00:58:45.089
My lucky night then. is it?

809
00:58:45.089 --> 00:58:46.523
- It's your lucky night.

810
00:58:48.826 --> 00:58:51.361
Sooner we get outta
here. the better.

811
00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:52.329
So early.

812
00:58:54.799 --> 00:58:56.300
Why waste time?

813
00:58:58.903 --> 00:58:59.870
Let's go.

814
00:59:46.516 --> 00:59:50.688
You're not real.

815
00:59:52.256 --> 00:59:53.323
Oh. oh. God.

816
00:59:54.659 --> 00:59:56.426
You're no real.

817
00:59:56.426 --> 00:59:57.261
You're not real.

818
01:00:39.203 --> 01:00:41.171
- Basement. hmm.

819
01:00:41.171 --> 01:00:43.573
- Ooh. hot.
- Yeah. that's just right.

820
01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:44.408
You got me there.

821
01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:45.575
Oh. yeah.

822
01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:46.410
Ooh.

823
01:00:49.747 --> 01:00:52.850
So do you come here often?

824
01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:53.784
Only on a Friday.

825
01:00:54.752 --> 01:00:55.552
Friday.

826
01:00:57.121 --> 01:00:58.322
Why Friday?

827
01:00:58.322 --> 01:01:00.758
Is that when you
like to be a bad boy?

828
01:01:00.758 --> 01:01:02.426
You could say that.

829
01:01:02.426 --> 01:01:05.996
You could also say
it's a bit of a ritual.

830
01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:10.467
How about we have
a bit of fun first.

831
01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:20.377
I would love to hear
you read for me.

832
01:01:28.986 --> 01:01:30.020
Where is it?

833
01:01:38.128 --> 01:01:39.363
- Where's what?

834
01:01:39.363 --> 01:01:40.297
My book!

835
01:01:40.297 --> 01:01:42.867
My fucking book is always here!

836
01:01:44.268 --> 01:01:46.670
The library isn't gonna
like you. tolly boy.

837
01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:48.739
There'll be a
bitch in late fees.

838
01:01:51.608 --> 01:01:52.542
Where is it?

839
01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:59.083
- About this big. made of skin?

840
01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:00.484
Full of creepy shit?

841
01:02:00.484 --> 01:02:03.120
Yes.

842
01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.855
Never heard of it.

843
01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:18.735
Something funny. Todd?

844
01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:27.344
- I don't need the book.

845
01:02:27.344 --> 01:02:30.114
I have the passage memorized.

846
01:02:30.114 --> 01:02:32.582
Seven times already. haven't I?

847
01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.051
Oh. good for you.

848
01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:35.719
Oh. it is. it is.

849
01:02:37.087 --> 01:02:39.323
'cause this is the last
time I've got to do this.

850
01:02:39.323 --> 01:02:42.059
Now repeat after me. Frederique.

851
01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:47.564
Absolutely fucking not.

852
01:02:50.868 --> 01:02:52.937
Don't make me make you.

853
01:02:57.074 --> 01:02:58.575
Well you'd have to make me.

854
01:02:58.575 --> 01:03:02.112
there's no way I'm saying
your creepy bullshit.

855
01:03:03.413 --> 01:03:05.349
You're a murderer and
you're gonna spend the rest

856
01:03:05.349 --> 01:03:08.618
of your days behind
bars where you belong

857
01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:10.520
being someone else's bitch.

858
01:03:12.222 --> 01:03:13.657
I've never killed anyone.

859
01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:15.960
- Yeah?
- Not really.

860
01:03:17.427 --> 01:03:19.763
Splitting hairs
now. Tiny Todd.

861
01:03:21.165 --> 01:03:23.400
They were whores.
what does it matter?

862
01:03:24.501 --> 01:03:27.571
- Speaking like the
true misogynist you are.

863
01:03:27.571 --> 01:03:29.306
who can't get it up.

864
01:03:31.775 --> 01:03:32.676
Say it!

865
01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:35.880
Say what?

866
01:03:35.880 --> 01:03:37.047
Frederique.

867
01:03:40.885 --> 01:03:42.486
Ah for fuck's sake!

868
01:03:42.486 --> 01:03:47.557
Frederique!

869
01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:51.595
Just fucking say it
you fucking slut!

870
01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:21.691
Please oh. it's not me.

871
01:04:22.226 --> 01:04:23.160
It's her.

872
01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.995
She's the eighth one.

873
01:04:25.762 --> 01:04:28.232
I've given you souls.

874
01:04:28.232 --> 01:04:30.000
It's not me. please.

875
01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:32.369
Freddy. no.

876
01:04:33.303 --> 01:04:34.204
Please.

877
01:04:35.305 --> 01:04:37.541
She's the eighth one.

878
01:05:33.097 --> 01:05:36.900
- Jess. Jess. they're
real. they're all real!

879
01:05:47.644 --> 01:05:48.545
Fuck you!

880
01:06:12.202 --> 01:06:16.906
This book. there must be
something in his book.

881
01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:26.483
There will be blood.

882
01:06:28.685 --> 01:06:33.190
Book is key. weakest
when summoned.

883
01:06:35.025 --> 01:06:39.163
War between heaven and
hell destroy the book.

884
01:06:39.163 --> 01:06:42.832
Use his weapon and
send back to hell.

885
01:06:44.068 --> 01:06:47.104
Jess. you fucking genius.

886
01:07:06.156 --> 01:07:07.057
- Ah.
- Oh.

887
01:07:12.196 --> 01:07:14.231
What the fuck happened?

888
01:07:14.231 --> 01:07:16.900
My house mate
has been murdered.

889
01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:20.036
We need to stop
whoever is doing this.

890
01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:20.937
- What?

891
01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:25.442
Look. this is Friday and
we only have 45 minutes left.

892
01:07:25.442 --> 01:07:28.011
This only happens on
Friday. we need to move.

893
01:07:28.011 --> 01:07:30.547
- No. we need to
call the police.

894
01:07:30.547 --> 01:07:31.948
We are the police.

895
01:07:31.948 --> 01:07:33.016
- Oh. fuck you know what I mean.

896
01:07:33.016 --> 01:07:34.784
We need to report this.

897
01:07:34.784 --> 01:07:37.521
Well. this book. this is the
only thing that can stop him.

898
01:07:37.521 --> 01:07:39.223
This is his weapon.

899
01:07:39.223 --> 01:07:41.591
We need to use this and we
need to put a stop to this.

900
01:07:41.591 --> 01:07:45.995
Otherwise. every Friday is
gonna be Freddy's Friday.

901
01:07:45.995 --> 01:07:49.333
I want you to
tell me everything.

902
01:07:49.333 --> 01:07:50.267
There is no time.

903
01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:51.835
No. I am not leaving here

904
01:07:51.835 --> 01:07:53.637
until you tell me
what's going on.

905
01:07:53.637 --> 01:07:55.105
First your boyfriend.
now your roommate.

906
01:07:55.105 --> 01:07:57.741
that's enough for me to take
you in and question you.

907
01:07:57.741 --> 01:07:58.808
Now talk.

908
01:08:02.279 --> 01:08:03.913
There's a demon
called Frederique

909
01:08:03.913 --> 01:08:06.216
and we've be calling him Freddy.

910
01:08:06.216 --> 01:08:07.817
You summon him and he gives
you anything you want.

911
01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:09.786
He gives you riches.
he gives you power.

912
01:08:09.786 --> 01:08:13.590
But you have to
sacrifice eight souls.

913
01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:16.493
And it only happens on a Friday.

914
01:08:16.493 --> 01:08:18.628
Why Friday?

915
01:08:19.529 --> 01:08:20.997
- I don't know.

916
01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:22.599
Maybe he's busy during
the week and I don't care.

917
01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:24.568
All I care about
is stopping him.

918
01:08:24.568 --> 01:08:27.137
So why kill your
boyfriend and your roommate?

919
01:08:27.137 --> 01:08:29.406
- Well that's my
fault because I.

920
01:08:29.406 --> 01:08:32.342
I took this book from the scene
and I read the incantation

921
01:08:32.342 --> 01:08:34.311
before I knew what it did.

922
01:08:34.311 --> 01:08:35.912
So now I owe him eight souls

923
01:08:35.912 --> 01:08:38.215
and they took them two
as part of the deal

924
01:08:38.215 --> 01:08:40.717
and we have to stop him.

925
01:08:40.717 --> 01:08:45.789
You do realize that this
sounds absolutely insane.

926
01:08:46.323 --> 01:08:48.024
Yes. I know.

927
01:08:48.024 --> 01:08:49.293
But please. please. Chief.

928
01:08:49.293 --> 01:08:51.795
come with me tonight and
I will show you. please.

929
01:08:52.696 --> 01:08:53.597
Please.

930
01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:58.735
All right. I'm
giving you tonight.

931
01:08:58.735 --> 01:09:00.003
That's it.

932
01:09:00.003 --> 01:09:02.572
After that I take you
in and I question you.

933
01:09:02.572 --> 01:09:03.373
- Deal.

934
01:09:03.373 --> 01:09:04.608
Let's go now.

935
01:09:11.548 --> 01:09:12.916
These are easy to swing.

936
01:09:15.219 --> 01:09:16.119
Got this.

937
01:09:17.086 --> 01:09:18.188
What's the plan?

938
01:09:18.188 --> 01:09:19.256
Follow me.

939
01:09:31.701 --> 01:09:34.103
God. it smells
like death down here.

940
01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:35.004
Mm-hmm.

941
01:09:35.872 --> 01:09:37.374
So what's the plan?

942
01:09:37.374 --> 01:09:39.142
Well. you are gonna
read the summing.

943
01:09:39.142 --> 01:09:43.213
Tell that Freddy that he's
gonna get his sacrifices.

944
01:09:43.213 --> 01:09:46.383
I'll read the Latin
parts. offering myself up.

945
01:09:46.383 --> 01:09:50.820
And when he comes to claim
me. we try and kill him.

946
01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:52.389
How?

947
01:09:52.389 --> 01:09:53.623
Look. just like I said.

948
01:09:53.623 --> 01:09:54.891
it has something to
do with this book

949
01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:56.860
and I don't know his own weapon.

950
01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:59.195
So when he comes down here.

951
01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.331
he's gonna be at his weakest.

952
01:10:01.331 --> 01:10:03.233
So that's is when
we have to do it.

953
01:10:04.968 --> 01:10:06.936
What if she's wrong?

954
01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:09.239
Jess won't be wrong.

955
01:10:09.239 --> 01:10:10.774
I thought you said that
you already summoned him.

956
01:10:10.774 --> 01:10:12.976
I did tell you that.

957
01:10:12.976 --> 01:10:14.744
But now that's why
I need you to do it

958
01:10:14.744 --> 01:10:17.981
so then I could
be the sacrifice.

959
01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:21.885
Okay. let me see this book.

960
01:10:30.294 --> 01:10:33.297
Okay. so you.
you read that poem.

961
01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:38.935
And you read that?

962
01:10:38.935 --> 01:10:40.069
Yeah.

963
01:10:43.139 --> 01:10:45.809
Frederique.

964
01:10:45.809 --> 01:10:47.777
No. no. no. no!

965
01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:54.384
- What the fuck is that?

966
01:10:55.652 --> 01:10:57.421
It's just like Jess said.

967
01:10:58.688 --> 01:11:02.025
the wall between hell
and here has come down.

968
01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:04.661
So this is when
he's at his weakest.

969
01:11:05.562 --> 01:11:06.996
We're gonna get him now.

970
01:12:17.734 --> 01:12:20.136
Oh. my God. are you okay?

971
01:12:20.136 --> 01:12:21.438
Oh. you're bleeding.

972
01:12:21.438 --> 01:12:22.472
Oh. my God.

973
01:13:29.473 --> 01:13:30.440
Oh. my God.

974
01:13:31.274 --> 01:13:32.108
Are you okay?

975
01:13:32.108 --> 01:13:33.209
This is crazy.

976
01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:34.177
We need to get out of here.

977
01:13:34.177 --> 01:13:35.679
Come on.

978
01:13:35.679 --> 01:13:37.847
- What the fuck?

979
01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:45.321
Oh. my God. let me see.

980
01:13:45.321 --> 01:13:46.456
Let's get outta here.

981
01:13:46.456 --> 01:13:47.857
Come on. they're all dead.

982
01:13:47.857 --> 01:13:49.392
Give me your arm.

983
01:13:49.392 --> 01:13:50.694
I've got you.

984
01:13:50.694 --> 01:13:52.128
Come on. let's get out.

985
01:13:52.128 --> 01:13:53.830
You've got this.

986
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:55.164
Let's get you help.

987
01:13:55.164 --> 01:13:59.836
Ah.
