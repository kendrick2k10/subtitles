You can't take me to your crib

00:00:46.263 --> 00:00:47.699
Just do it tonight

23
00:00:47.873 --> 00:00:50.746
And I ain'’t know why I fuck

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.445
Gonna end up falling in love
with you

25
00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:57.231
It'’s the type of shit you
expose me to

26
00:00:57.405 --> 00:01:00.669
Then I pulled up side by side
in my Mercedes coupe

27
00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.585
Ain'’t nobody got you like I got you

28

00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:25.128
You can ride it all night

It'’s the type of shit you

42
00:01:38.707 --> 00:01:42.928
Then I pulled up side by side
in my Mercedes coupe

43
00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:46.932
A wise man once said. falling
in love

44
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.501
is the one fall you don'’t get
up from

45
00:01:51.198 --> 00:01:53.504
Guess we'’re lovesick.

46
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:06.517
It'’s a love letter. it'’s some
things that I do. but I won'’t
say I do

47
00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:09.651
You should get to know me better

48
00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:11.653

That you are unlucky in love.

I might pull up on my baby.

74
00:04:16.647 --> 00:04:19.563
Rolling through the ocean in a
white boat

75
00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:23.524
Pull up and salute in a white ghost

76
00:04:24.612 --> 00:04:27.136
What else does it say?

77
00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.582
Fucking finally. that's the exchange.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.934

80
00:04:49.332 --> 00:04:52.379

87
00:05:10.527 --> 00:05:12.268
Nah. it'’s just some cook.

88
00:05:12.877 --> 00:05:14.966
Sure as shit he's in there.

89
00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:19.536
How many fucking trash bags
can you fucking bring out

90
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:21.451
She just wanna go dancing...

91
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.107

Lovesick Diner. Hello?

Hi. Is Don there?

95
00:05:31.243 --> 00:05:32.810
Who is this again?

96
00:05:32.984 --> 00:05:35.160
Oh. don't play dumb. You know
who this is?

97
00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:36.858
I'm not playing. bitch.

98
00:05:37.032 --> 00:05:38.555
Put him on the phone.

99
00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.644
Put him on the phone.

100
00:05:40.818 --> 00:05:42.733
I'm sorry. You just missed him.

101
00:05:42.907 --> 00:05:46.215
Look. Imma walk my ass over

Now you want to look out for me?

109
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:20.641
I'm just looking.

110
00:06:20.815 --> 00:06:24.079
I told you. I can't be put on a leash.

111
00:06:24.775 --> 00:06:27.387
This is gonna get me killed one day

112
00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.478
but I know

113
00:06:32.261 --> 00:06:33.871
I could have had him

114
00:06:38.049 --> 00:06:40.487
There'’s a girl outside.
The one with the great ass.

115
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:44.229
Of course I'’d rather be there

116
00:06:44.404 --> 00:06:46.710
I love your family.

117
00:06:46.884 --> 00:06:50.932
No. it's just in this case.
we have to wait for the money.
Just- That's it.

118
00:06:51.106 --> 00:06:53.891
And we just have to find out
where the money's going. No.

119
00:06:54.065 --> 00:06:57.678
- It'’s not like that hon.
- Oh. I wouldn't mind getting
that for Christmas.

120
00:06:57.852 --> 00:06:59.157
What? No. I

121
00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:00.942
Honey. I don't know what he's
talking about.

122
00:07:01.116 --> 00:07:03.205
No- okay.

123
00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:04.728

124
00:07:04.902 --> 00:07:07.035
Okay? I'm gonna come home right now.

125
00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:09.124

Fucking hung up on me.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

129
00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:19.656
How's that my fault?

130
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:22.354
What you giving me a hard time
for. - fucking shut up

131
00:07:30.928 --> 00:07:32.887
Don ain'’t here

132
00:07:33.322 --> 00:07:35.585
Good. Cause we're here to see you.

133
00:07:35.759 --> 00:07:39.850
Woah. looks like someone's
feeling the Christmas spirit.

134
00:07:40.024 --> 00:07:42.287
We know you're mad at him.

135
00:07:42.766 --> 00:07:44.289
I mean. shit.

136
00:07:44.681 --> 00:07:47.771
If I treated my wife like he
treats you.

137
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:50.731
He's a dog

138
00:07:50.905 --> 00:07:52.254
but I'm not a rat.

139
00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:55.910
Well. we just thought that
maybe you'd like the chance to
hurt him.

140
00:07:56.824 --> 00:08:00.784
Hmm. I can do that my own way.

141
00:08:00.958 --> 00:08:03.526
Don'’t I make you feel special?

142
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:05.441
Thanks for your help.

143
00:08:05.615 --> 00:08:08.662
Low key gotta be gotta be right
there for your loving

144
00:08:08.836 --> 00:08:12.796
I'’m hoping I am what you seek

145

Hold on. he come with that. Ooh-
Ooh here he come

146
00:08:21.109 --> 00:08:24.155
Quick little jab to the head

147
00:08:24.329 --> 00:08:26.027
Oh. come on. man.

148
00:08:26.201 --> 00:08:28.333
See. you really got to be on
that right?

149
00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:31.815
That boy is surgical with it

150
00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.300
Champ is getting old. man.

151
00:08:38.474 --> 00:08:39.910
Still the champ

152
00:08:40.084 --> 00:08:40.781
Yeah.

153
00:08:41.651 --> 00:08:43.174
Ooh- Ooh-

154
00:08:43.435 --> 00:08:44.915
a king on his own.

155
00:08:45.089 --> 00:08:47.135
A king only sits on his throne
for so long

156
00:08:48.136 --> 00:08:49.964
Yeah. well. I'm out

157
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:19.341
I hope it's good. man.

158
00:09:19.515 --> 00:09:21.212
What the hell is this?

159
00:09:21.386 --> 00:09:24.259
This shit it's slippier than
a pimp's pocketbook. man.

160
00:09:24.433 --> 00:09:25.913
Yeah. What'’s going on here?

161
00:09:26.087 --> 00:09:28.132
I ordered a soft steak. This is
a pet rock

162
00:09:28.306 --> 00:09:30.352
Meat'’s tougher than a midget
trying a slam dunk.

163
00:09:30.526 --> 00:09:32.049
Who the hell made this?

164
00:09:32.223 --> 00:09:33.964
Man. I thought Rick James had
some slick hair

165
00:09:34.138 --> 00:09:35.879
Look at all of grease on this
damn bacon. man.

166
00:09:36.053 --> 00:09:38.142
Who's the cook around here?

167
00:09:39.056 --> 00:09:41.232
Where they get him from? The
penitentiary?

168
00:09:41.406 --> 00:09:42.973
My God man.

169
00:09:43.147 --> 00:09:45.062
it ain't like it looked on the
picture. man.

170
00:09:45.236 --> 00:09:47.021
I swear to God. man.

171
00:09:47.195 --> 00:09:49.589
Like a three stars porta potty
establishmen. I'’m scared

172
00:09:49.763 --> 00:09:52.722
- Who'’s the new girl?
- God. man. this is. tell you one
thing man

173
00:09:52.896 --> 00:09:55.638
This meat is tougher than a fat
drawer trying to fit to a skinny
door. man.

174
00:09:55.812 --> 00:09:58.206
I ain'’t never going to eat at
this damn place again.

175
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.208
They get down...

176
00:10:06.083 --> 00:10:08.782
I just wanna pick you up.
Can it go down?

177
00:10:08.956 --> 00:10:10.740
Hit you in the backseat.

178
