There was only two of 'em.

any Japs.

58
00:07:12.432 --> 00:07:14.434

basis. Harris.

59
00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:19.003
If any of us are captured.
it's gonna be best

60
00:07:19.134 --> 00:07:20.918
that we don't know anything.

61
00:07:21.049 --> 00:07:23.486
The Japanese have a knack
for making people talk.

62
00:07:26.184 --> 00:07:29.666
- Did you say three hundred
Japanese on the island. sir?

63
00:07:29.797 --> 00:07:31.407
- Give or take. yeah.

64
00:07:31.538 --> 00:07:32.582
- What about him?

65
00:07:32.713 --> 00:07:34.105
What's he doing here?

66
00:07:34.236 --> 00:07:36.673
- If you're referring to
Lance Daffadar Singh. Harris.

67
00:07:36.804 --> 00:07:39.937
he's on temporary transfer
from the 77th Indian Brigade.

68
00:07:40.068 --> 00:07:42.070
- Weren't there any
English lads available?

69
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.116
- It was decided.
Harris. given the climate

70
00:07:45.247 --> 00:07:47.118
we're all enduring at the
moment.

71
00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:49.599

Brigade might just survive

to some tropical disease
of the digestive function.

74
00:07:57.607 --> 00:08:01.089
- Er. now that you mention it.
sir...

75
00:08:01.219 --> 00:08:02.307
- Mention what?

76
00:08:02.438 --> 00:08:04.179
- The digestive function. sir.

77
00:08:05.615 --> 00:08:07.835
- Well. you can have five
minutes. go on.

78
00:08:07.965 --> 00:08:09.445
Get well away from the path.

79
00:08:10.315 --> 00:08:12.230
And put that camera away. you
lose that

80
00:08:12.361 --> 00:08:13.971
this whole trip's for nothing.

81
00:08:14.102 --> 00:08:17.801
- Sir? May I also request five
minutes?

82
00:08:17.932 --> 00:08:18.889
- Fine.

83
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.282
- Yeah and I need a piss an'
all.

84
00:08:20.412 --> 00:08:21.762
- Fine.

85
00:08:21.892 --> 00:08:22.980

92
00:09:09.026 --> 00:09:10.462
- Japanese fighter.

93
00:09:10.593 --> 00:09:12.856
Been here more than a
year by the looks of it.

94
00:09:14.597 --> 00:09:16.860
- Do you think it's one
of them kamikaze pilots?

95
00:09:16.991 --> 00:09:20.081
- If he was. he missed his
bleeding target. didn't he?

96
00:09:20.211 --> 00:09:22.518
Unless he was aiming for a
bleeding hole in the ground!

97
00:09:24.476 --> 00:09:25.608
- Save your film. Pike.

98
00:09:25.739 --> 00:09:27.567
We're not here to take holiday
snaps.

99
00:09:29.699 --> 00:09:30.874

[footsteps falling]

104
00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:01.513
- Sir. may I be so bold
as to make a suggestion?

105
00:10:02.863 --> 00:10:03.690
- You may.

106
00:10:05.126 --> 00:10:07.911
- Look. the light is dimming.

107
00:10:09.391 --> 00:10:11.436
When the sun falls behind the
tree line.

108
00:10:11.567 --> 00:10:15.223
I predict it will become
very dark. very quickly.

109
00:10:16.964 --> 00:10:20.445
I suggest we set up camp
as soon as possible.

110
00:10:20.576 --> 00:10:22.360
- I second that. Sarge.

111
00:10:22.491 --> 00:10:24.101
My feet are bleedin' killing me.

112
00:10:24.232 --> 00:10:25.537
- Well alright.

113
00:10:25.668 --> 00:10:27.801
I guess we're far enough
off the beaten track

114
00:10:27.931 --> 00:10:29.063
here to take a rest.

115
00:10:30.064 --> 00:10:31.413
You carrying the rations. Singh?

116
00:10:31.543 --> 00:10:32.414
- Yes sir.

117
00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.286
- Permission to light a fire.
Sarge?

118
00:10:35.417 --> 00:10:37.462
- Weather not warm enough for
you. Harris?

119
00:10:37.593 --> 00:10:39.073
- It's not that. Sarge.

120
00:10:39.203 --> 00:10:41.553
I just don't fancy having cold
baked beans for tea again.

121
00:10:41.684 --> 00:10:42.554
- Alright.

122
00:10:44.252 --> 00:10:45.993

125
00:11:10.931 --> 00:11:12.584
What are you doing with my pack?

126
00:11:16.023 --> 00:11:18.025
- I believe you're carrying the
matches.

127
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:20.331
To light the fire?

128
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.508
- I'll light the fire.

129
00:11:24.988 --> 00:11:26.555
And don't touch my pack again.

130
00:11:27.948 --> 00:11:29.558
- What's the problem. Harris?

131
00:11:29.689 --> 00:11:31.865
- Well. you can't trust
'em. Sarge. can you?

132
00:11:33.301 --> 00:11:35.085
It's not like he's one of us. is
it?

133
00:11:36.913 --> 00:11:39.481
- D'you know. Harris. the men
of the 77th Indian Brigade.

134
00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:41.222
they're all volunteer fighters.

135
00:11:42.049 --> 00:11:42.963
Looking at the state of you

136
00:11:43.093 --> 00:11:45.269
I can only assume you were
drafted.

137
00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:46.488
- I volunteered.

138
00:11:46.618 --> 00:11:47.663
- When. 1944?

139
00:11:49.796 --> 00:11:50.797
Can't have been out here long.

140
00:11:50.927 --> 00:11:52.189
you'd have been used to the heat
by now.

141
00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.321
- I've done my bit.

142
00:11:54.844 --> 00:11:56.846
I volunteered for this mission.
didn't I?

143
00:11:58.152 --> 00:11:59.327
Whatever the hell we're doing
here.

144
00:11:59.457 --> 00:12:01.416
- Watch your mouth. Private!

145
00:12:03.113 --> 00:12:03.984
And keep it down.

146
00:12:05.507 --> 00:12:07.988
We're still in enemy territory
in case you'd forgotten.

147
00:12:10.077 --> 00:12:13.167
- Yes. Sarge.

148
00:12:13.297 --> 00:12:14.168
Sorry Sarge.

149
00:12:19.086 --> 00:12:22.132
- Well. is somebody
gonna cook these beans?

150
00:12:22.263 --> 00:12:23.960
I'm bloody starving.

151
00:12:24.091 --> 00:12:24.918
- Yes sir!

[soothing piano music]

154
00:12:57.689 --> 00:13:00.170
- 'Ere. what kind of gum you
got?

155
00:13:01.432 --> 00:13:04.392
- American. " Fruity Mint." or
something.

156
00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.223
I traded it for a pack
of fags with this Yank

157
00:13:09.353 --> 00:13:10.441
when I first came out.

158
00:13:13.053 --> 00:13:14.881
I'm saving it for a special
occasion.

159
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.492
- Can I have a bit?

160
00:13:17.622 --> 00:13:21.061
- Fuck off! I've only got one
stick left.

161
00:13:23.193 --> 00:13:24.281
And I'm keeping it for when

162
00:13:24.412 --> 00:13:26.327
we're on that boat out of this
shit-hole.

163
00:13:29.243 --> 00:13:32.768
- See her? That's my fiancee.
Olive.

164
00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:37.773
Nice. ain't she?

165
00:13:39.775 --> 00:13:42.430
- Not now. Pike. My
stomach's giving me gyp.

166
00:13:44.388 --> 00:13:45.912
- I took these myself.

167
00:13:46.042 --> 00:13:49.524
My uncle's got a little
photography
studio down town centre.

168
00:13:49.654 --> 00:13:51.439
He's showing me how to run the
business.

169
00:13:51.569 --> 00:13:52.440
- Wonderful.

170
00:13:53.484 --> 00:13:55.660
- And when all of this is over.

171
00:13:55.791 --> 00:13:58.402
I'm gonna be a professional
photographer.

172
00:13:58.533 --> 00:14:01.318
You know. weddings.
babies. that sort of thing.

173
00:14:02.232 --> 00:14:06.933
And me and Olive. yeah.
we're gonna get married.

174
00:14:08.325 --> 00:14:09.500
- Bleedin' hell. Pike.

175
00:14:10.501 --> 00:14:12.852
Do you realize. you've
just reduced your chances

176
00:14:12.982 --> 00:14:15.637
of getting out of here alive
by about eighty percent

177
00:14:15.767 --> 00:14:16.768
by telling me that?

[Harris sighing]

179
00:14:19.641 --> 00:14:22.078
Have you not seen the
picture about the last lot?

- What. the Great War?

181
00:14:23.819 --> 00:14:26.343
- Yeah. The war to end
all wars. they said.

182
00:14:31.522 --> 00:14:32.306
- Did you fight in it?

183
00:14:32.436 --> 00:14:33.655
- I'm not that bloody old. am I?

184
00:14:35.265 --> 00:14:37.615
I just saw a lot of pictures
about it.

185
00:14:37.746 --> 00:14:42.751
And Pike. let me tell you
something.

186
00:14:44.622 --> 00:14:47.103
The lad that waves around a
photograph

187
00:14:47.234 --> 00:14:48.888
of his beloved fiancee back
home.

188
00:14:49.976 --> 00:14:50.759
[Harris sighs]

189
00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:53.022
he never makes it to the end.

190
00:14:53.153 --> 00:14:55.895
[fire crackling]

191
00:14:59.246 --> 00:15:01.770
- Aren't you lads gonna get some
sleep?

192
00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:04.033
Long trek tomorrow to
get where we're going.

193
00:15:04.164 --> 00:15:06.296
- Yeah. I thought there might
be.

194
00:15:06.427 --> 00:15:07.907
This didn't look like a very big
island.

195
00:15:08.037 --> 00:15:10.344
but it's taking us
bloody ages to cross it.

196
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.478
- With the greatest of
respect to you. Mr Harris.

197
00:15:14.609 --> 00:15:16.828
I don't believe we are
crossing the island.

198
00:15:16.959 --> 00:15:17.873
- What?

199
00:15:18.004 --> 00:15:20.832
- Unless I am mistaken. I
believe

200
00:15:20.963 --> 00:15:22.617
we are going around the edge.

201
00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.228
- What makes you say that?

202
00:15:27.883 --> 00:15:30.407
- Earlier on in the day. when
the wind

203
00:15:30.538 --> 00:15:32.366
was blowing in the right
direction.

204
00:15:32.496 --> 00:15:34.934
I could detect the sound of the
ocean.

205
00:15:35.064 --> 00:15:38.415
even after walking for
all these many hours.

206
00:15:38.546 --> 00:15:40.591
- Why the bleedin' hell are
we going around the edge?

207
00:15:40.722 --> 00:15:44.291
- The centre of Ramree
Island is impassable. sir.

208
00:15:47.511 --> 00:15:49.296
We will definitely fail our
mission

209
00:15:49.426 --> 00:15:51.428
if we try to cross it directly.

210
00:15:51.559 --> 00:15:53.213
- How do you know that?

211
00:15:53.343 --> 00:15:54.997
Does he know where we are?

212
00:15:55.128 --> 00:15:58.174
How come he gets to know
where we are and I don't?

213
00:15:58.305 --> 00:15:59.784
I'm more senior than him.

214
00:15:59.915 --> 00:16:02.613
- Technically. sir. Lance
Daffadar

215
00:16:02.744 --> 00:16:04.833
is a higher rank than Private.

216
00:16:04.964 --> 00:16:08.402
- Shut it! An Englishman
out ranks any of you lot.

217
00:16:08.532 --> 00:16:09.838
Tell him. Sarge.

218
00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:11.187
- Keep your voices down.

219
00:16:12.232 --> 00:16:13.059
All of you!

220
00:16:17.019 --> 00:16:19.065
- Apologies for the
misunderstanding. sir.

221
00:16:20.327 --> 00:16:22.503
Sgt Turner didn't tell me
anything.

222
00:16:23.591 --> 00:16:26.072
I merely calculated our location

223
00:16:26.202 --> 00:16:27.943
with the evidence available.

224
00:16:28.074 --> 00:16:30.467
just like your very own Sherlock
Holmes.

225
00:16:31.338 --> 00:16:32.817
- What's he on about?

226
00:16:32.948 --> 00:16:34.254
- Explain yourself. Singh.

227
00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:37.997
- Well sir. first of all.

228
00:16:38.127 --> 00:16:40.477
I knew we weren't too far from
Burma.

229
00:16:40.608 --> 00:16:42.523
That is what narrowed it down.

230
00:16:42.653 --> 00:16:43.741
- Narrowed it down?

231
00:16:44.786 --> 00:16:47.919
There are over eight hundred
islands in this area. Singh.

232
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:51.184
- Yes sir. But not as many
Japanese bases

233
00:16:51.314 --> 00:16:54.622
with three hundred men. and
even less with an air strip.

234
00:16:56.667 --> 00:16:58.843
I examined the wreckage earlier
sir.

235
00:16:59.757 --> 00:17:01.063
It's not battle-damaged.

236
00:17:02.630 --> 00:17:06.547
I believe the plane crashed
on either take off or landing.

237
00:17:08.679 --> 00:17:10.116
- Very good. Singh.

238
00:17:11.682 --> 00:17:12.814
What about our mission?

239
00:17:14.946 --> 00:17:16.470
You figured that out as well?

240
00:17:17.993 --> 00:17:19.386
- No. no sir.

241
00:17:21.301 --> 00:17:24.173
Except to say...

242
00:17:24.304 --> 00:17:25.131
- Yes?

243
00:17:27.089 --> 00:17:30.310
- Well. the young man and his
camera...

244
00:17:31.615 --> 00:17:32.486
- What about me?

245
00:17:34.009 --> 00:17:37.056
- With the greatest of
respect. Private Pike.

246
00:17:37.186 --> 00:17:40.450
I don't believe you're here
to show your battle skills.

247
00:17:42.365 --> 00:17:47.153
I believe you're here to show
your photographic skills.

248
00:17:47.283 --> 00:17:48.197
- Is that it. sir?

249
00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:51.157
Are we just gonna take
photographs of the base?

250
00:17:51.287 --> 00:17:52.114
- Not quite.

251
00:17:54.029 --> 00:17:56.814
We have aerial photographs
that precisely locate

252
00:17:56.945 --> 00:17:58.555
the position of the base.

253
00:17:58.686 --> 00:18:02.472
What we don't have is the
position of their munitions
store.

254
00:18:05.519 --> 00:18:07.608
Well the Japanese aren't stupid.

255
00:18:07.738 --> 00:18:09.218
they're not gonna locate the
store

256
00:18:09.349 --> 00:18:11.090
near where their lads sleep.

257
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.874
and they're not gonna store it

258
00:18:13.004 --> 00:18:14.484
where we can see it from the
air.

259
00:18:15.616 --> 00:18:17.270
But we know it's there. 'cause
we've seen

260
00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.142
boats coming and going for
months bringing the stuff in.

261
00:18:22.405 --> 00:18:25.191
If we can pinpoint the location
of the munitions store.

262
00:18:26.235 --> 00:18:29.760
get a good image of it to
give to the lads in the RAF.

263
00:18:29.891 --> 00:18:32.198
they stand a good chance of
scoring a direct hit on it.

264
00:18:32.328 --> 00:18:34.896
and then. boom!

265
00:18:35.026 --> 00:18:36.245
- Bloody Japs.

266
00:18:36.376 --> 00:18:37.551
They won't know what's hit 'em.

267
00:18:37.681 --> 00:18:40.945
- Right. Which means the
follow-up attack by land

268
00:18:41.076 --> 00:18:43.861
stands a very good chance
of taking the island back.

269
00:18:43.992 --> 00:18:46.516
with the added benefit
of a very nice airstrip.

270
00:18:48.257 --> 00:18:53.001
So. this is why it was supposed
to be a tightly-kept secret.

271
00:18:54.045 --> 00:18:56.439
The Japanese get word that
we're planning an attack.

272
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.049
they'll be ready for us.

273
00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.747
We won't stand a chance.

274
00:19:02.445 --> 00:19:04.055
Now. unless there are any more
questions.

275
00:19:04.186 --> 00:19:08.973
what I would suggest is.
no. what I would command is.

276
00:19:09.104 --> 00:19:11.628
you get your heads down. get
some sleep.

277
00:19:12.542 --> 00:19:14.631
Soon as the sun's up. we're on
the move.

278
00:19:15.502 --> 00:19:17.025
- Yes sir.
- Yes sir.

279
00:19:18.896 --> 00:19:19.984
- [Sgt. Turner] Harris?

280
00:19:21.421 --> 00:19:23.074
- Just one question. sir.

281
00:19:23.205 --> 00:19:24.467
- What's that?

282
00:19:24.598 --> 00:19:27.644
- Well. if we did encounter
some of those Japs.

283
00:19:27.775 --> 00:19:29.429
and they were trying to kill us.

284
00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:33.215
and it was situation like
them or us. can we kill 'em?

285
00:19:35.609 --> 00:19:37.915
- Orders are not to engage.

286
00:19:38.873 --> 00:19:39.613
- Fuckin' 'ell.

287
00:19:39.743 --> 00:19:40.614
- What was that?

288
00:19:41.615 --> 00:19:42.442
- Nothing. Sarge.

289
00:19:43.399 --> 00:19:44.618
- I hope it was nothing.

290
00:19:45.749 --> 00:19:46.707
Get some sleep.

291
00:19:46.837 --> 00:19:49.666
[birdsong ringing]

292
00:19:49.797 --> 00:19:52.495

[suspenseful music]

300
00:21:07.614 --> 00:21:08.484
- Oi!

[blows landing]

[dramatic music]

311
00:21:26.546 --> 00:21:28.765
- Oi. Pike! Get your camera out!

312
00:21:30.071 --> 00:21:31.725
I want to take a picture for me
mum.

313
00:21:32.726 --> 00:21:33.727
- What the bloody hell

314
00:21:33.857 --> 00:21:35.859
do you think you're playing at.
Harris?

315
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:37.296
- I had to do it. Sarge.

316
00:21:37.426 --> 00:21:38.558
They were onto us.

317
00:21:38.688 --> 00:21:41.604
- Really? Well they certainly
will be now.

318
00:21:41.735 --> 00:21:43.214
Right. back to camp.

319
00:21:43.345 --> 00:21:44.433
Get packed up.

320
00:21:44.564 --> 00:21:46.087
We're moving out now.

321
00:21:46.217 --> 00:21:48.611
- Come on! Just one picture!

322
00:21:52.572 --> 00:21:54.400
[footsteps falling]

323
00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.358
I mean. what type of war is
this.

324
00:21:57.577 --> 00:21:59.753
if we can't take out a few Japs?

325
00:22:03.060 --> 00:22:04.192
[revolver cocking]

326
00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:05.498

[arrow whooshes]
[Japanese soldier grunting]

328
00:22:13.767 --> 00:22:15.246
- Where did you learn to do
that?

329
00:22:15.377 --> 00:22:18.249
- We have a very similar
plant in India. sir.

330
00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:20.600
[birdsong sounding]

331
00:22:20.730 --> 00:22:21.949
- Ow!

332
00:22:22.079 --> 00:22:24.386
- Be careful Mr Harris.
sir. it's very sharp.

333
00:22:24.517 --> 00:22:25.431
- Now you tell me!

334
00:22:28.259 --> 00:22:31.654
It strikes me. you could
be quite a dangerous man.

335
00:22:31.785 --> 00:22:35.266
- Only in the service of
the British Empire. sir.

336
00:22:35.397 --> 00:22:36.267
- If you say so.

337
00:22:37.791 --> 00:22:39.836
- Shall we catch up with the
others?

338
00:22:39.967 --> 00:22:41.316
- I'm watching you.

339
00:22:41.447 --> 00:22:44.450
[suspenseful music]

340
00:22:52.283 --> 00:22:55.678
[running footsteps]

341
00:22:55.809 --> 00:22:57.680
- Oh. good of you to grace us
with your presence. Harris.

342
00:22:57.811 --> 00:22:59.203
Are you ready to move on?

343
00:22:59.334 --> 00:23:02.076
- Look Sarge. if they'd
found us all asleep.

344
00:23:02.206 --> 00:23:03.686
we'd all be dead by now.

345
00:23:03.817 --> 00:23:06.167
- Don't give me that. you
went out looking for trouble.

346
00:23:06.297 --> 00:23:07.560
You certainly found it.

347
00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:09.692
you have put this mission
into serious jeopardy.

348
00:23:09.823 --> 00:23:10.998
- How d'you reckon that?

349
00:23:11.128 --> 00:23:13.304
- According to the plan
we've got a two-day walk

350
00:23:13.435 --> 00:23:15.263
until we get to the Japanese
base.

351
00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:17.396
three-day walk back to the
pick-up point.

352
00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:21.312
- You may not have noticed
but those Japanese soldiers

353
00:23:21.443 --> 00:23:24.620
you took on weren't carrying
supplies. so.

354
00:23:25.795 --> 00:23:26.883
less than a day's walk

355
00:23:27.014 --> 00:23:28.885
from some sort of Japanese
encampment.

356
00:23:29.016 --> 00:23:32.367
Let's be generous. say eight
hours.

357
00:23:33.629 --> 00:23:36.327
sixteen hours before
they realize back at base

358
00:23:36.458 --> 00:23:38.199
they're not coming back from
patrol.

359
00:23:38.329 --> 00:23:40.201
send troops out looking for
them.

360
00:23:40.331 --> 00:23:41.463
find the bodies.

361
00:23:42.682 --> 00:23:44.727
Assuming they've got a field
radio.

362
00:23:45.728 --> 00:23:48.383
every soldier on this
island is looking for us

363
00:23:48.514 --> 00:23:50.472
24 hours from now.

364
00:23:54.128 --> 00:23:56.260
- Apologies for the
interruption. sir.

365
00:23:56.391 --> 00:23:57.827
but the Japanese would have
guessed

366
00:23:57.958 --> 00:24:00.003
we are targeting the munitions
store.

367
00:24:00.134 --> 00:24:01.744
They will double the guard at
least.

368
00:24:01.875 --> 00:24:03.050
- You shut up!

369
00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:04.051
- He's right.

370
00:24:05.008 --> 00:24:08.272
We may evade the search. but
we're stuffed

371
00:24:08.403 --> 00:24:10.753
if we don't get near that
munitions store.

372
00:24:11.754 --> 00:24:14.409
- Might it be as well to
abandon the mission. sir?

373
00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:15.541
- I've considered all the
options.

374
00:24:15.671 --> 00:24:17.456
Pike. including that one.

375
00:24:18.979 --> 00:24:21.068
But the pick-up boat's not
coming back 'til Tuesday

376
00:24:21.198 --> 00:24:22.373
and we're sitting ducks if we're

377
00:24:22.504 --> 00:24:24.114
waiting around in the meantime.

378
00:24:25.551 --> 00:24:28.597
The only course of action
is to change the route.

379
00:24:34.081 --> 00:24:34.951
[map thudding]

380
00:24:35.082 --> 00:24:36.431
Look at the shape of the island.

381
00:24:36.562 --> 00:24:38.955
long. thin. like a cucumber.

382
00:24:39.086 --> 00:24:41.697
That's why it's taking so
long to go round the edge.

383
00:24:41.828 --> 00:24:43.482
But if we went straight across.

384
00:24:43.612 --> 00:24:45.658
as the crow flies. we might

385
00:24:45.788 --> 00:24:48.182
just be there in under 24 hours.

386
00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.967
- But sir. the terrain?

387
00:24:51.098 --> 00:24:53.448
- Is swampland. yes I know that
Mr Singh.

388
00:24:53.579 --> 00:24:55.755
But I thought that was one your
strengths.

389
00:24:55.885 --> 00:24:58.279
you were brought up in this
kind of climate. weren't you?

390
00:24:58.409 --> 00:24:59.672
- They say the swamplands

391
00:24:59.802 --> 00:25:02.849
of Ramree Island are almost
impassable.

392
00:25:02.979 --> 00:25:04.981
- You're not scared of
getting your feet wet are you?

393
00:25:05.112 --> 00:25:06.896
- My Olive got pneumonia once.

394
00:25:07.027 --> 00:25:08.637
they said that was from
getting her feet wet.

395
00:25:08.768 --> 00:25:10.291
- Well that was in England.

396
00:25:10.421 --> 00:25:11.379
You're not gonna get pneumonia
out here.

397
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:12.511
it's too bloody hot.

398
00:25:12.641 --> 00:25:15.818
- Quiet! This isn't up for
discussion

399
00:25:15.949 --> 00:25:16.993
now get moving.

400
00:25:26.655 --> 00:25:27.700
- Shit!

401
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:29.658
[grenades rolling]

402
00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:30.616
- What's this?

403
00:25:32.313 --> 00:25:33.575
- It's just a few grenades.
Sarge.

404
00:25:33.706 --> 00:25:34.881
- And who authorized you to
bring them?

405
00:25:35.011 --> 00:25:37.492
- Well. it was on my own
initiative. sir.

406
00:25:37.623 --> 00:25:38.580
- Initiative?

407
00:25:39.973 --> 00:25:42.845
I've seen more initiative
in a goldfish. Harris.

408
00:25:42.976 --> 00:25:43.803
What were you gonna do with them

409
00:25:43.933 --> 00:25:45.326
on a reconnaissance mission?

410
00:25:47.371 --> 00:25:48.808
One of those goes off.

411
00:25:48.938 --> 00:25:52.289
every Japanese soldier
within earshot's after us.

412
00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:55.031
Four of us versus three hundred.

413
00:25:55.162 --> 00:25:56.555
How do you think that's gonna
work out?

414
00:25:56.685 --> 00:25:58.992
- I just wanna blow a
few of those bastards up.

415
00:25:59.122 --> 00:26:00.210
Isn't that what we're here for?

416
00:26:00.341 --> 00:26:02.212
- You are here to protect the
interests

417
00:26:02.343 --> 00:26:04.040
of the British Empire in
whatever way

418
00:26:04.171 --> 00:26:06.608
your superior officers see fit.

419
00:26:07.522 --> 00:26:10.351
You may want to go out in
a blaze of glory. Harris.

420
00:26:10.481 --> 00:26:11.526
the rest of us would quite like

421
00:26:11.657 --> 00:26:14.224
to get off this island in one
piece.

422
00:26:15.312 --> 00:26:17.140
- What shall we do with them.
sir?

423
00:26:17.271 --> 00:26:19.360
- I've half a mind to leave them
here.

424
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:20.883
But that'd be like leaving a
trail

425
00:26:21.014 --> 00:26:23.364
of breadcrumbs for the Japanese.

426
00:26:23.494 --> 00:26:25.061
No. put them in your pack.
Singh.

427
00:26:25.192 --> 00:26:26.323
- Aw Sarge!

428
00:26:26.454 --> 00:26:27.934
Anyone but him!

429
00:26:28.064 --> 00:26:29.326
You can't trust 'em.

430
00:26:29.457 --> 00:26:31.720
Right now. I'd sooner trust him
than you.

431
00:26:31.851 --> 00:26:32.982
- But he isn't even English!

432
00:26:33.113 --> 00:26:34.593
- Now get moving.

433
00:26:40.424 --> 00:26:41.338
[birds chirping]

434
00:26:41.469 --> 00:26:44.515
[suspenseful music]

435
00:26:49.390 --> 00:26:50.347
[water birds and frogs
chattering]

436
00:26:50.478 --> 00:26:53.263
This is it lads. straight on
through.

437
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.919
- Told you we were gonna get out
feet wet.

438
00:26:57.050 --> 00:26:59.443
- Well how deep do you think it
gets?

439
00:26:59.574 --> 00:27:01.054
'Cause I'm not much of a
swimmer.

440
00:27:01.184 --> 00:27:01.968
- [Sgt. Turner] I don't
think it'll come over

441
00:27:02.098 --> 00:27:03.273
your head. Pike.

442
00:27:03.404 --> 00:27:05.406
Come on. we've no time to lose.

443
00:27:05.536 --> 00:27:07.451
I don't much fancy wading
through this lot in the dark

444
00:27:07.582 --> 00:27:09.584
but I don't think we've got much
choice.

445
00:27:11.891 --> 00:27:14.589
- Forgive me. sir. but what is
that?

446
00:27:15.764 --> 00:27:16.896
[suspenseful music]

447
00:27:17.026 --> 00:27:19.725
[birds chirping]

448
00:27:22.292 --> 00:27:23.511
- Jesus Christ!

449
00:27:29.212 --> 00:27:31.388
- It's a Japanese soldier.

450
00:27:33.869 --> 00:27:36.002
- I wonder what he was doing out
here?

451
00:27:36.132 --> 00:27:37.481
- And what happened to him?

452
00:27:38.787 --> 00:27:40.876
- I read something about the
Japanese.

453
00:27:41.007 --> 00:27:43.052
If one of their men disgraces
his unit.

454
00:27:44.097 --> 00:27:46.926
they send him out to the
countryside with a sword.

455
00:27:47.056 --> 00:27:48.275
And then?

456
00:27:48.405 --> 00:27:50.407
Well and then he kills himself.

457
00:27:50.538 --> 00:27:53.280
Takes his sword and puts
it right through his guts.

458
00:27:53.410 --> 00:27:54.585
I don't know how they could do
it.

459
00:27:54.716 --> 00:27:56.196
I couldn't do it.

460
00:27:57.676 --> 00:27:58.894
It's called Harry something.

461
00:27:59.025 --> 00:28:00.330
- Harakiri.

462
00:28:00.461 --> 00:28:02.245
- You heard of it. sir?
[birds chirping urgently]

463
00:28:02.376 --> 00:28:03.769
- I've seen them do it. Pike.

464
00:28:05.553 --> 00:28:09.078
But if that was the case.
what's happened to his sword?

465
00:28:10.993 --> 00:28:13.953
- Never mind that. what
happened to his bleedin' legs?

466
00:28:14.083 --> 00:28:14.867
D'you think he chopped 'em off

467
00:28:14.997 --> 00:28:16.651
and they ran away on their own?

468
00:28:16.782 --> 00:28:19.785
[suspenseful music]

469
00:28:26.052 --> 00:28:28.663
- Sir? This could be a
worrying development.

470
00:28:29.795 --> 00:28:31.622
What if there's something in the
water?

471
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:34.321
- We move on.

472
00:28:43.634 --> 00:28:46.812
[army boots sloshing]

473
00:28:49.162 --> 00:28:50.467
[crickets chirping]

474
00:28:50.598 --> 00:28:52.295
- Can you really tell where
we are on there. Sarge?

475
00:28:52.426 --> 00:28:53.427
- As long as we keep going

476
00:28:53.557 --> 00:28:55.124
in a straight line we'll be on
course.

477
00:28:55.255 --> 00:28:56.604
- A straight line!

478
00:28:57.692 --> 00:28:59.476
We could be going around
in circles for all we know.

479
00:28:59.607 --> 00:29:02.262
- We're going east. Harris.

480
00:29:03.306 --> 00:29:05.700
All I need is a compass to
confirm that.

481
00:29:05.831 --> 00:29:07.963
- Sgt. Turner is correct.

482
00:29:08.094 --> 00:29:11.010
I've been tracking our progress
in line with the stars.

483
00:29:11.140 --> 00:29:12.533
- The stars?

484
00:29:12.663 --> 00:29:14.404
How ridiculous. how can you see

485
00:29:14.535 --> 00:29:16.319
the stars through all that fog?

486
00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:17.973
- Well. I could earlier.

487
00:29:18.844 --> 00:29:20.410
[Pike yawns]

488
00:29:20.541 --> 00:29:22.064
- You all right. Pike?

489
00:29:22.195 --> 00:29:22.978
- Just tired. sir.

490
00:29:23.109 --> 00:29:25.241
- Aah. is it past your bedtime?

491
00:29:25.372 --> 00:29:26.895
- That's enough. Harris.

492
00:29:27.026 --> 00:29:28.027
- Sorry. Sarge.

493
00:29:28.897 --> 00:29:32.509
- Actually. Sarge. I've just
been thinking

494
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.991
about what Harris said. about
all those old war pictures.

495
00:29:36.949 --> 00:29:38.777
and the lads who didn't make it
home.

496
00:29:40.169 --> 00:29:41.649
Just got me thinking 'bout
Olive. is all.

497
00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:46.480
and. you know. who's going to
look after her if I don't...

498
00:29:47.089 --> 00:29:49.875
- Pike. I wouldn't take any
notice about what I say.

499
00:29:50.745 --> 00:29:53.008
I'm just a miserable old git who
spends

500
00:29:53.139 --> 00:29:55.706
too much time at the pictures.
aren't I?

501
00:29:55.837 --> 00:29:59.493
- Yeah. well. I bet you've seen
more of the war than I have.

502
00:29:59.623 --> 00:30:01.669
- To be honest. Sarge was right.

503
00:30:02.844 --> 00:30:04.237
I only signed up last year.

504
00:30:06.282 --> 00:30:07.762
Well how come you weren't
drafted?

505
00:30:07.893 --> 00:30:09.242
It's a long story.

506
00:30:10.852 --> 00:30:13.028
- Still. you didn't need to sign
up

507
00:30:13.159 --> 00:30:14.638
for this mission. did you?

508
00:30:14.769 --> 00:30:15.988
- Well. I thought I was gonna be

509
00:30:16.118 --> 00:30:17.250
blowing something up. didn't I?

510
00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.599
- Quiet. Harris!

511
00:30:19.426 --> 00:30:20.340
You don't know how close we
might be

512
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:22.255
to a Japanese encampment.

513
00:30:22.385 --> 00:30:24.344
- Even the Japanese have
got more sense than to camp

514
00:30:24.474 --> 00:30:26.476
in the middle of a bloody swamp.

515
00:30:26.607 --> 00:30:27.782
Ain't that right. Pike?
[Sgt. Turner whooshes]

516

[compass splashing]

517
00:30:29.305 --> 00:30:32.395
- Jesus Christ. Harris.
look what you made me do!

518
00:30:32.526 --> 00:30:33.962
- What was that?

519
00:30:34.093 --> 00:30:35.834
- The compass. it's in the
water. somewhere over there.

520
00:30:35.964 --> 00:30:36.922
Start searching.

521
00:30:38.749 --> 00:30:41.796
[suspenseful music]

522
00:30:44.407 --> 00:30:45.191
- Have we got another one?

523
00:30:45.321 --> 00:30:46.540
- No. not me.

524
00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:49.586
- What happens if we can't find
it?

525
00:30:53.112 --> 00:30:55.549
- Sgt. Turner. sir. can I
have use of the torch. sir?

526
00:30:55.679 --> 00:30:58.421
I think I saw something here.

527
00:30:58.552 --> 00:30:59.988
- Yes. all right.

528
00:31:06.603 --> 00:31:09.824
[Sgt. Turner yells]
[Water splashes]

529
00:31:09.955 --> 00:31:11.478
- What's happened?

530
00:31:13.045 --> 00:31:15.003
- Looks like the Sarge has gone
arse over tit in the water.

531
00:31:15.134 --> 00:31:16.004
[Harris laughs]

532
00:31:16.135 --> 00:31:18.137
Sarge?

533
00:31:18.267 --> 00:31:19.529
Sarge?

534
00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.488
- Sarge?
- Give me that!

535
00:31:21.618 --> 00:31:24.708
Sarge! Sarge! Sarge!

536
00:31:25.927 --> 00:31:27.059
- Please. sir! Quiet!

537
00:31:27.189 --> 00:31:29.017
The enemy could be nearby.

538
00:31:30.453 --> 00:31:31.367
- Never mind that.

539
00:31:33.021 --> 00:31:34.718
It could be right in front of
me.

540
00:31:36.198 --> 00:31:37.547
Pike?

541
00:31:37.678 --> 00:31:39.636
- Erm. I was just looking at the
water.

542
00:31:40.899 --> 00:31:42.291
- So maybe you took your chance

543
00:31:42.422 --> 00:31:44.772
while no one was looking. huh?

544
00:31:45.816 --> 00:31:46.861
- Really. sir?

545
00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.211
I must protest...

546
00:31:49.342 --> 00:31:51.779
- Come on. Harris. he's
on our side. surely?

547
00:31:51.910 --> 00:31:52.780
- Is he?

548
00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:57.045
There's a lot them that
don't like us. us English.

549
00:31:58.046 --> 00:32:00.222
I've even heard some of you
are siding with the Japs.

550
00:32:00.353 --> 00:32:02.703
- Please. Mr Harris sir. I can
assure you

551
00:32:02.833 --> 00:32:04.574
I wasn't part of that faction.

552
00:32:04.705 --> 00:32:07.055
My family was hugely benefiting
by trading

553
00:32:07.186 --> 00:32:08.709
with the British Empire.

554
00:32:08.839 --> 00:32:11.146
How could I make Sgt. Turner
disappear?

555
00:32:11.277 --> 00:32:12.539
- I don't know.

556
00:32:13.714 --> 00:32:16.195
You were looking pretty
handy this morning though.

557
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:19.285
Maybe the Sarge is floating down
the river

558
00:32:19.415 --> 00:32:21.852
with a bleedin' tropical
leaf stuck in his neck?

559
00:32:25.117 --> 00:32:27.946
- Really. sir? With the utmost
respect.

560
00:32:28.076 --> 00:32:29.773
can you stop wasting time.

561
00:32:29.904 --> 00:32:32.341
so I can resume my
search for the Sergeant?

562
00:32:33.647 --> 00:32:34.691
- You listen to me.

563
00:32:36.345 --> 00:32:38.260
In the absence of a commanding
officer.

564
00:32:39.696 --> 00:32:40.959
I'm the most senior here

565
00:32:42.047 --> 00:32:44.223
and I'm running this shit-show
now.

566
00:32:44.353 --> 00:32:46.442
- In that case. sir. shouldn't
you

567
00:32:46.573 --> 00:32:49.619
be using this valuable time
trying

568
00:32:49.750 --> 00:32:51.447
to figure a way out of this
swamp?

569
00:32:52.535 --> 00:32:55.234
- Come on. Harris. he's right.

570
00:32:55.364 --> 00:32:57.801
We should be looking for the
compass.

571
00:32:57.932 --> 00:33:00.804
You don't really think
he killed Sarge do you?

572
00:33:00.935 --> 00:33:04.286
- From now on. you don't
go out of my sight.

573
00:33:04.417 --> 00:33:05.244
You got that?

574
00:33:07.768 --> 00:33:08.595
- Yes sir.

575
00:33:08.725 --> 00:33:10.858
[bird cawing]

576
00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:11.946
- I'm watching you.

577
00:33:13.078 --> 00:33:14.731
Now get looking for that
compass.

578
00:33:16.603 --> 00:33:17.343
- Yes sir.

579
00:33:17.473 --> 00:33:18.344
- Yes sir.

580
00:33:19.649 --> 00:33:21.347
[water sloshing]

581
00:33:21.477 --> 00:33:24.654
- May I point out a
small inaccuracy you made

582
00:33:24.785 --> 00:33:27.309
in an earlier statement. Mr
Harris?

583
00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:28.615
[Pike sloshing water]

584
00:33:28.745 --> 00:33:31.792
[suspenseful music]

585
00:33:33.141 --> 00:33:36.797
As you know. my rank is of Lance
Dafadar.

586
00:33:36.927 --> 00:33:39.582
You and Mr Pike are Privates.

587
00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:45.893
So as far as your claim goes.

588
00:33:46.024 --> 00:33:47.634
as being the senior man.

589
00:33:47.764 --> 00:33:49.114
I'm really sorry to say.

590
00:33:49.244 --> 00:33:51.638
that is specifically incorrect.
sir.

591
00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.731
[water splashing]

592
00:33:57.861 --> 00:33:59.820
- Don't push your bleedin' luck.
Singh.

593
00:34:00.951 --> 00:34:02.083
I've just about had enough of...

594
00:34:02.214 --> 00:34:03.128
Jesus Christ!

595
00:34:04.607 --> 00:34:05.652
- What is it?

596
00:34:05.782 --> 00:34:07.219
- Something just went past my
leg!

597
00:34:09.569 --> 00:34:10.265
[Pike yells]

598
00:34:10.396 --> 00:34:11.701
- Pike! What is it?

599
00:34:11.832 --> 00:34:14.095
- I. er. found the compass.

600
00:34:15.357 --> 00:34:17.707
[monkey chattering]

601
00:34:17.838 --> 00:34:19.753
- You gave me a bleedin' heart
attack.

602
00:34:19.883 --> 00:34:21.015
[water bubbling]
[dramatic music]

603
00:34:21.146 --> 00:34:22.538
- Look. there!

604
00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:23.626
- [Harris] What?

605
00:34:23.757 --> 00:34:24.627
- There's something in the
water!

606
00:34:24.758 --> 00:34:25.889
- [Harris] Where?

607
00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.021
[water bubbling]

608
00:34:27.152 --> 00:34:28.153
- Don't shoot!

609
00:34:28.283 --> 00:34:29.806
The Japanese!

610
00:34:29.937 --> 00:34:32.896
- I couldn't care less about
the Japanese at this point!

611
00:34:33.027 --> 00:34:35.595
I'm more concerned about
what just went past my leg.

612
00:34:36.596 --> 00:34:39.903
- I suggest we move very
quickly!

613
00:34:40.034 --> 00:34:41.470
- Pike. which way is east?

614
00:34:41.601 --> 00:34:42.776
- Uh.

615
00:34:42.906 --> 00:34:43.603
[water creature growling]

616
00:34:43.733 --> 00:34:44.908
It's that way!

617
00:34:45.039 --> 00:34:46.867
- Wait! What is that?

618
00:34:48.173 --> 00:34:49.391
- It's the Sarge!

619
00:34:49.522 --> 00:34:50.653
- Somebody get him up.

620
00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:58.748

624

- Fuck me!

625
00:35:04.754 --> 00:35:05.755
- Don't shoot. sir!

626
00:35:05.886 --> 00:35:06.669
The Japanese!

627
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.801
- Fuck the Japanese!

628
00:35:09.368 --> 00:35:10.630
- It's not going to work.

629
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:11.718
The pistol!

630
00:35:13.633 --> 00:35:14.416
- What are you on about?

631
00:35:14.547 --> 00:35:15.548
- They have very thick hides!

632
00:35:15.678 --> 00:35:16.549
- What do?

633
00:35:21.728 --> 00:35:22.598
- Crocodiles.

634
00:35:27.212 --> 00:35:28.996
- Let's get out of here!

635
00:35:29.127 --> 00:35:31.390

639
00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:02.943
- Well. we made it. [grunts]

640

[birds and crickets singing]

641
00:36:04.379 --> 00:36:04.945
I never thought we were gonna
see the end

642
00:36:05.075 --> 00:36:06.599
of that bleedin' swamp.

643
00:36:06.729 --> 00:36:07.730
[Pike sighs]

644
00:36:07.861 --> 00:36:09.950
Permission to have a rest sir?

645
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.299
- Why are you asking me?

646
00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.955
- I believe you volunteered

647
00:36:15.782 --> 00:36:18.828
to take over the mission last
night. sir.

648
00:36:18.959 --> 00:36:22.441
- Hah! Yeah. that's a laugh.
innit?

649
00:36:26.532 --> 00:36:28.838
[water splashing]

650
00:36:28.969 --> 00:36:32.015
- Are you suggesting we give up?

651
00:36:33.016 --> 00:36:33.887
- I'm suggesting

652
00:36:34.931 --> 00:36:36.498
you tell me

653
00:36:36.629 --> 00:36:39.632
everything you know about
crocodiles.

654
00:36:39.762 --> 00:36:42.330
[haunting music]

655
00:36:42.461 --> 00:36:44.419
- Not very much. sir.

656
00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:47.509
But we do have them in India.

657
00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.641
The same type.

658
00:36:49.598 --> 00:36:53.298
The saltwater crocodile.
[ominous music]

659
00:36:54.821 --> 00:36:58.520
[water splashing]
[haunting music]

660
00:36:58.651 --> 00:36:59.695
- That ain't salt water.

661
00:36:59.826 --> 00:37:00.957
- No. sir.

662
00:37:01.088 --> 00:37:02.350
It's.

663
00:37:02.481 --> 00:37:04.178
It's just the name of the breed.

664
00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.225
- Well. how do you know?

665
00:37:07.355 --> 00:37:09.139
We haven't even seen one.

666
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:12.839
- It's the kind of breed that
lives in these swamplands.

667
00:37:12.969 --> 00:37:14.362
It is the same back home.

668
00:37:14.493 --> 00:37:15.189
- What are you?

669
00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:16.538
A crocodile expert now?

670
00:37:16.669 --> 00:37:19.367
- No. not at all. sir.

671
00:37:19.498 --> 00:37:23.632
But. I did see one attack a man
once.

672
00:37:24.677 --> 00:37:26.026
- What happened?

673
00:37:28.724 --> 00:37:30.726
- I was very. very young.

674
00:37:30.857 --> 00:37:32.424
[nostalgic music]

675
00:37:32.554 --> 00:37:37.167
Me and a few friends decided
to go on an expedition

676
00:37:37.298 --> 00:37:38.473
out of the city.

677
00:37:39.866 --> 00:37:42.869
We were reading up about your
very own Dr. Livingstone.

678
00:37:43.913 --> 00:37:46.916
So we imagined we will be
exploring

679
00:37:47.047 --> 00:37:49.310
the farthest reaches of Africa.

680
00:37:50.355 --> 00:37:52.879
Just three young boys and a
pani-wallah.

681
00:37:53.009 --> 00:37:54.272
- What's that?

682
00:37:54.402 --> 00:37:56.230
- It's a man who carried the
water for us.

683
00:37:56.361 --> 00:37:57.971
- What. like a servant?

684
00:37:58.101 --> 00:37:59.407
- Yes.

685
00:37:59.538 --> 00:38:02.236
He was sent from home by my
father.

686
00:38:02.367 --> 00:38:05.587
- Christ. I never knew
you lot had servants.

687
00:38:05.718 --> 00:38:07.981
I thought you were the servants.

688
00:38:08.111 --> 00:38:12.246
- He was from a very low
caste and I feel ashamed

689
00:38:12.377 --> 00:38:14.335
because we treated him very
poorly.

690
00:38:16.424 --> 00:38:18.861
He begged us not to go
into the swamp water

691
00:38:18.992 --> 00:38:21.821
because he knew we would ruin
our shoes

692
00:38:21.951 --> 00:38:23.388
and he would get the blame.

693
00:38:24.954 --> 00:38:28.915
But we didn't listen to him
because we didn't respect him.

694
00:38:29.045 --> 00:38:32.092
[melancholic music]

695
00:38:32.222 --> 00:38:34.050
One of us found some sticks

696
00:38:34.181 --> 00:38:37.445
so we decided to go fishing
by the water's edge.

697
00:38:38.620 --> 00:38:42.624
And then it appeared out of
nowhere!

698
00:38:42.755 --> 00:38:45.105
[dramatic music]

699
00:38:45.235 --> 00:38:48.761
A huge. monstrous scaly
head come out of the water.

700
00:38:50.415 --> 00:38:55.158
This poor man put himself
between us and the crocodile.

701
00:38:58.858 --> 00:39:02.252
It was so fast like it
was with the Sergeant.

702
00:39:04.211 --> 00:39:06.822
- You knew all this and
you let us go wandering

703
00:39:06.953 --> 00:39:10.217
into a crocodile-infested swamp
without telling us anything?

704
00:39:10.348 --> 00:39:13.089
- No. I tried to warn the
Sergeant.

705
00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:14.743
but he was most insistent.

706
00:39:14.874 --> 00:39:17.093
- Well. you didn't do a
very good job. did you?

707
00:39:17.224 --> 00:39:19.095
- I was thinking about the
mission.

708
00:39:25.798 --> 00:39:28.104
- All right.

709
00:39:28.235 --> 00:39:30.193
We've still got a mission to
accomplish

710
00:39:31.151 --> 00:39:32.587
for what it's bleedin' worth.

711
00:39:34.937 --> 00:39:36.286
We've still got the compass.

712
00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.463
we've still got the camera

713
00:39:39.464 --> 00:39:41.770
and we've still got the
grenades.

714
00:39:41.901 --> 00:39:46.122
So just maybe. maybe we can
make something worthwhile

715
00:39:46.253 --> 00:39:47.820
out of this shit-show yet.

716
00:39:48.821 --> 00:39:50.475
[dramatic music]

717
00:39:50.605 --> 00:39:52.128
Let's get a couple of hour's kip

718
00:39:53.173 --> 00:39:54.130
[Harris sighs]

719
00:39:54.261 --> 00:39:55.610
and then we'll head east.

720
00:39:56.481 --> 00:39:57.525
See what we can find.

721
00:40:11.234 --> 00:40:14.586
[leaves rustling]
[birds calling]

722
00:40:14.716 --> 00:40:16.414
- Who is that in the picture?

723
00:40:16.544 --> 00:40:18.285
- Don't tell him. Pike!

724
00:40:18.416 --> 00:40:20.896
- My fiancee. Olive.

725
00:40:21.027 --> 00:40:22.855
[Harris sighs]
- That's it. mate.

726
00:40:22.985 --> 00:40:24.944
You've got no chance now.

750
00:43:08.542 --> 00:43:09.369
- Oi!

[suspenseful music]

752
00:43:11.153 --> 00:43:11.937
- Mr Harris!

753
00:43:12.067 --> 00:43:13.068
- Don't you "Mr Harris" me!

754
00:43:13.199 --> 00:43:14.504
- I'm really sorry. sir.

755
00:43:14.635 --> 00:43:16.332
I thought you was an enemy.

756
00:43:16.463 --> 00:43:17.769
- I bet you did!

757
00:43:17.899 --> 00:43:20.641
[dramatic music]

758
00:43:26.299 --> 00:43:28.780
- Really. sir. there's
no need for the pistol.

759
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:30.608
- I'll be the judge of that.
Singh.

760
00:43:30.738 --> 00:43:32.044
What are you up to?

761
00:43:32.174 --> 00:43:33.480
- Up to?

762
00:43:33.611 --> 00:43:35.743
- I saw you nick that
compass out of Pike's bag

763
00:43:35.874 --> 00:43:38.224
and you know without
that we're all screwed.

764
00:43:38.354 --> 00:43:39.442
So what are you up to?

765
00:43:40.879 --> 00:43:42.663

[water splashing]
[crocodile growling]

767
00:43:45.623 --> 00:43:47.363
- Please. Mr Harris. sir.

768
00:43:47.494 --> 00:43:49.539
I insist you lower the gun.

769
00:43:49.670 --> 00:43:51.454
- You insist. or what?

770
00:43:51.585 --> 00:43:53.543
- I may be forced to take
unfortunate measures.

771
00:43:53.674 --> 00:43:54.370
- Oh yeah?

772
00:43:54.501 --> 00:43:55.763
I'd like to see that.

773
00:43:55.894 --> 00:43:58.505

786
00:44:49.121 --> 00:44:50.122
- He's gone.

787
00:44:53.952 --> 00:44:54.648
- Crocodiles.

788
00:44:54.779 --> 00:44:57.782

[footsteps falling]

791
00:45:16.496 --> 00:45:19.978
[Harris sighs]
- I told him.

792
00:45:22.458 --> 00:45:23.503
I bleedin' told him!

793
00:45:27.681 --> 00:45:28.682
He was just a kid.

794
00:45:29.814 --> 00:45:31.076
[Harris sighs]

795
00:45:31.206 --> 00:45:33.121
He shouldn't have been out
here in the first place.

796
00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:37.517
[sighs]
Stupid kid.

797
00:45:38.997 --> 00:45:40.999
[sighs]

798
00:45:44.176 --> 00:45:46.178
- Who's gonna tell her. hey?

799
00:45:46.308 --> 00:45:48.223
[Harris breathes rapidly]

800
00:45:48.354 --> 00:45:50.835
Who's gonna turn up with
a cap in their hand.

801
00:45:51.836 --> 00:45:54.882
And a "Sorry Mrs. Harris.
he died too young.

802
00:45:55.927 --> 00:45:57.580
"but he was serving his
country."

803
00:46:00.627 --> 00:46:02.020
- "Mrs Harris"?

804
00:46:02.890 --> 00:46:03.761
- What?

805
00:46:05.023 --> 00:46:07.634
- Don't you mean Mrs. Pike?

806
00:46:07.765 --> 00:46:10.550
[dramatic music]

807
00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.292

[melancholic music]

809
00:46:17.426 --> 00:46:19.037
[Harris breathes deeply]
I had a little brother.

810
00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:21.561
Will.

811
00:46:23.563 --> 00:46:25.217
He was about the same age as
Pike.

812
00:46:27.306 --> 00:46:29.874
First in line at the town
hall to join up. he was.

813
00:46:31.571 --> 00:46:33.747
I had special dispensation.

814
00:46:34.574 --> 00:46:37.098
'cause someone had to stay at
home and look after my mum.

815
00:46:38.883 --> 00:46:39.884
Will couldn't wait.

816
00:46:41.668 --> 00:46:44.236
He thought he was going to
Germany to fight Hitler.

817
00:46:45.063 --> 00:46:46.325
[Harris scoffs]

818
00:46:46.455 --> 00:46:47.848
But he was never any
bleedin' good at geography.

819
00:46:48.893 --> 00:46:49.850
He ended up in Singapore.

820
00:46:49.981 --> 00:46:50.808
Stupid sod.

821
00:46:55.334 --> 00:46:57.902
He didn't know Singapore
from Streatham High Street.

822
00:46:59.947 --> 00:47:02.080
He just thought it was
gonna be this big adventure.

823
00:47:04.082 --> 00:47:05.431
Even sent us a letter home.

824
00:47:07.433 --> 00:47:09.609
Saying there was nothing to do.

825
00:47:09.739 --> 00:47:12.046
Him and the boys were just
lying around in their bunks

826
00:47:12.177 --> 00:47:13.961
trying to avoid the sun.

827
00:47:14.092 --> 00:47:16.921
[nostalgic music]

828
00:47:19.706 --> 00:47:20.620
And then we heard

829
00:47:22.578 --> 00:47:23.841
the Japanese had attacked.

830
00:47:24.754 --> 00:47:27.627
[dramatic music]

831
00:47:30.543 --> 00:47:32.458
We never had any more letters
after that.

832
00:47:32.588 --> 00:47:35.374
[nostalgic music]

833
00:47:35.504 --> 00:47:38.551
[birdsong ringing]

834
00:47:38.681 --> 00:47:39.726
Months went by.

835
00:47:41.467 --> 00:47:43.164
and then there was a knock on
the door.

836
00:47:44.209 --> 00:47:46.733
Some Sergeant Major or other.

837
00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:51.303
We knew it was bad because
he had his cap in his hand.

838
00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.090
And with him was this
tiny scrap of a bloke.

839
00:47:58.049 --> 00:47:59.093
All skin and bone.

840
00:48:03.489 --> 00:48:06.927
Well anyway. this bloke
introduced himself.

841
00:48:08.494 --> 00:48:09.756
[Harris sighing]

842
00:48:09.887 --> 00:48:11.062
Turns out he was fighting
alongside our Will.

843
00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.501
When they got captured by the
Japs.

844
00:48:17.372 --> 00:48:21.333
they ended up in some prisoner
of war camp in Thailand.

845
00:48:27.687 --> 00:48:28.949
You should've heard the things

846
00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:33.519
they did to my little
brother. [inhales sharply]

847
00:48:34.389 --> 00:48:35.695
I wish my mum hadn't have
been in the same room

848
00:48:35.825 --> 00:48:37.218
and heard all that.

849
00:48:37.349 --> 00:48:41.657
[mellow instrumental music]

850
00:48:41.788 --> 00:48:45.183
This bloke. he made it out
alive. barely.

851
00:48:48.926 --> 00:48:50.231
And Will didn't.

852
00:48:55.019 --> 00:48:56.063
The next day

853
00:48:57.021 --> 00:48:59.110
I packed my mum off to
live with her sister

854
00:49:00.067 --> 00:49:01.242
then I signed up.

855
00:49:03.375 --> 00:49:06.465
And now. here we are.

856
00:49:08.467 --> 00:49:10.251
We've still got a mission to
finish.

857
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:14.386
And you know what?

858
00:49:14.516 --> 00:49:16.083
We're gonna finish this mission.

859
00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.391
For Pike.

860
00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:22.611
For the Sarge.

861
00:49:24.396 --> 00:49:26.137
And I don't care what you're up
to.

862
00:49:28.313 --> 00:49:29.923
We're gonna find that ammo dump

863
00:49:31.142 --> 00:49:32.926
and we're gonna blow the fucker
up.

864
00:49:34.754 --> 00:49:37.887
If we made it out of that
crocodile-infested swamp.

865
00:49:38.018 --> 00:49:39.063
we can do anything.

866
00:49:42.196 --> 00:49:43.241
[eerie music]

867
00:49:43.371 --> 00:49:44.242
- Um.

868
00:49:47.071 --> 00:49:47.985
actually

869
00:49:51.901 --> 00:49:55.993
the reason I took the compass
and went out walking earlier.

870
00:49:56.123 --> 00:49:58.647
was so I could try to
ascertain our position

871
00:49:58.778 --> 00:50:00.823
and plan our route eastward.

872
00:50:02.564 --> 00:50:03.435
- And?

873
00:50:04.784 --> 00:50:07.134
- To the east there's just more
swamp.

874
00:50:08.657 --> 00:50:10.094
- How about north?

875
00:50:10.224 --> 00:50:11.051
- More swamp.

876
00:50:11.878 --> 00:50:13.271
- South?

877
00:50:13.401 --> 00:50:14.272
- Swamp.

878
00:50:17.536 --> 00:50:19.059
- Are you telling me-

879
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:23.020
- I'm sorry to say we're
not out of the swamp.

880
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:25.848
We're on an island in
the middle of the swamp.

[crocodile growling]

884
00:51:04.148 --> 00:51:06.933
I didn't know about your
brother.

885
00:51:10.154 --> 00:51:14.375
But now I can understand
why you hate them so much.

886
00:51:15.811 --> 00:51:16.899
The Japanese.

887
00:51:17.813 --> 00:51:20.947
[crocodile growling]

888
00:51:23.602 --> 00:51:28.563
But I was wondering. what
if that body we saw earlier.

889
00:51:28.694 --> 00:51:33.699
of that Japanese man. he
had a brother in Japan?

890
00:51:34.874 --> 00:51:38.443
Or a mother waiting for
her son to come back home?

891
00:51:38.573 --> 00:51:41.533
- Yeah. well they started it.
didn't they?

892
00:51:41.663 --> 00:51:45.754
I mean. look. Singapore and Hong
Kong.

893
00:51:45.885 --> 00:51:47.104
It's British territory.

894
00:51:48.235 --> 00:51:50.716
We had the right to be
there and they didn't.

895
00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.893
- It wasn't always British
territory. sir.

896
00:51:54.023 --> 00:51:55.938
- Well. we invaded it first.

897
00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:03.990
Look!

898
00:52:07.428 --> 00:52:08.255
What's that?

899
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:10.736
- It's Pike's backpack!

900
00:52:10.866 --> 00:52:12.477
- No it's not.

901
00:52:12.607 --> 00:52:14.653
There's a map sticking out the
top.

902
00:52:14.783 --> 00:52:15.915
It's Sarge's.

903
00:52:17.046 --> 00:52:19.397
- If only we could get that map-

904
00:52:19.527 --> 00:52:22.095
- We'd have a bleedin'
chance to get out of here.

[dramatic music]

906
00:52:26.752 --> 00:52:27.666
What do you think?

907
00:52:30.277 --> 00:52:32.453
- What do I think of what?

908
00:52:32.584 --> 00:52:33.759
- Getting the backpack?

909
00:52:37.980 --> 00:52:40.026
- Let's not be too hasty.

910
00:52:40.157 --> 00:52:42.463
- Come on. it's not that far
out.

911
00:52:42.594 --> 00:52:45.901
- Perhaps. with you
being the senior officer.

912
00:52:46.032 --> 00:52:48.165
it will be a privilege
for you to carry out

913
00:52:49.296 --> 00:52:50.471
such a heroic act?

914
00:52:50.602 --> 00:52:51.646
- Don't give me that.

915
00:52:51.777 --> 00:52:52.560
I thought you were the senior
officer?

916
00:52:52.691 --> 00:52:55.128
- It's very complicated. yaar.

917
00:52:55.259 --> 00:52:57.261
There's too many ranks.

918
00:52:57.391 --> 00:52:58.610
- Look. I've got an idea.

919
00:52:59.698 --> 00:53:00.829
Let's go fishing.

923
00:53:12.450 --> 00:53:14.321
Good thing you got those
extra bootlaces in your pack.

924
00:53:15.453 --> 00:53:16.671
- Do you think it will hold?

925
00:53:16.802 --> 00:53:18.064
- Why not?

926
00:53:18.195 --> 00:53:20.327
You haven't got to lift the pack
up.

927
00:53:20.458 --> 00:53:22.286
Just hook it. pull it in.

[ominous music]

929
00:53:25.289 --> 00:53:27.334
- Who's going to hold it?

930
00:53:27.465 --> 00:53:28.335
- Well.

931
00:53:29.249 --> 00:53:30.990
you've been fishing in a swamp
before.

00:53:32.296 --> 00:53:33.297

- It's not long enough!

938
00:53:50.836 --> 00:53:52.359
- Ah. just go in a bit!

939
00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:54.274
- It still won't be long enough!

940
00:53:54.405 --> 00:53:56.145
- It will be if you go far
enough.

941
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:00.889
Don't worry about it.

942
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:03.849
I'll keep an eye out for the
crocodiles.

943
00:54:03.979 --> 00:54:05.024
- Are you sure?

944
00:54:05.154 --> 00:54:06.199
- Just get on with it.

945
00:54:06.330 --> 00:54:07.940
You'll be in and out in two
minutes.

It's looking at me!

957
00:55:14.615 --> 00:55:17.183
What should I do?
[crocodile growls]

958
00:55:17.314 --> 00:55:18.793
- Well. I thought you
knew about these things!

959
00:55:18.924 --> 00:55:20.142
- I'm struggling to remember

960
00:55:20.273 --> 00:55:21.927
the finer details at this
moment!

961
00:55:22.884 --> 00:55:24.103
- How good can they see?

962
00:55:25.409 --> 00:55:26.627
Maybe you should stay still.

- Christ!
- What?

966
00:55:35.767 --> 00:55:38.160

[crocodile growls]

968
00:55:39.597 --> 00:55:40.772
Do they hunt in packs?

[crocodile rumbling]

971
00:55:47.300 --> 00:55:48.170

972
00:55:50.216 --> 00:55:51.086
Get out!

You could've kept hold of the
pole!

976
00:56:03.925 --> 00:56:05.187
- I'm really sorry. sir.

977
00:56:05.318 --> 00:56:07.973
I didn't think it was
a priority at the time.

978
00:56:08.103 --> 00:56:09.844
- I mean. they've gone.

979
00:56:09.975 --> 00:56:10.802
Want to try again?

Oh. come on. look. just
down there. in and out.

982
00:56:15.197 --> 00:56:16.982
I'll keep an eye this time. I
promise.

983
00:56:17.112 --> 00:56:18.679
- No. no. it's not that.

984
00:56:20.377 --> 00:56:24.555
Every time we go into the water
we attract their attention.

985
00:56:24.685 --> 00:56:27.819
And then we come running
back to the land for safety.

986
00:56:27.949 --> 00:56:32.519
What if they grow bold enough
and decide to follow us?

987
00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:33.999
- [Harris] Can they do that?

988
00:56:34.129 --> 00:56:35.174
- They're not like fish. you
know. sir.

989
00:56:35.304 --> 00:56:37.002
They have legs!

990
00:56:40.135 --> 00:56:42.877
- Well without that map. we
don't know which way to go

991
00:56:43.008 --> 00:56:44.139
to get off this bleedin' island.

992
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:45.314
- I understand. sir.

00:56:46.359 --> 00:56:48.317

I haven't seen a single
crocodile.

It's like we imagined the whole
thing.

[exasperated sigh]

999
00:57:11.079 --> 00:57:12.733
I swear there were loads of 'em.

1000
00:57:12.864 --> 00:57:14.735
And now there's not one.

1001
00:57:17.172 --> 00:57:18.913
Maybe they've swam off somewhere
else?

1002
00:57:19.044 --> 00:57:22.003
Like birds. when they all fly
off at once.

1003
00:57:22.134 --> 00:57:24.876
- Are you suggesting crocodiles
migrate?

1004
00:57:25.006 --> 00:57:27.705
- I don't mean they've
gone south for the winter.

1005
00:57:27.835 --> 00:57:29.489
Maybe they've just gone for a
swim.

- Fucking bastard crocodiles!

1013
00:58:03.088 --> 00:58:04.219
Look at that!

1014
00:58:05.090 --> 00:58:08.528
They've been waiting there the
whole time.

1015
00:58:11.226 --> 00:58:13.228
- They can hold their
breath for several hours.

1016
00:58:13.359 --> 00:58:14.665
- Are you the expert again?

1017
00:58:15.666 --> 00:58:17.494
- No. it was just an
observation.

1018
00:58:20.627 --> 00:58:24.326
And I also observe every
time the water splashes

1019
00:58:24.457 --> 00:58:27.416
it attracts their
attention. just as I feared.

1020
00:58:32.117 --> 00:58:33.510
- Yeah. it does. doesn't it?

1021
00:58:37.426 --> 00:58:39.211
- What are you thinking?

1022
00:58:41.474 --> 00:58:42.780
- I'm thinking

1023
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:44.695
if something was splashing
the water over there.

1024
00:58:46.087 --> 00:58:48.089
that might attract their
attention long enough

1025
00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:50.439
for someone else to go
and get the backpack.

1026
00:58:53.878 --> 00:58:56.794
- It seems like a risky plan at
both ends.

1027
00:58:59.231 --> 00:59:00.537

to go into the water. Mr Harris.
sir?

1031
00:59:13.985 --> 00:59:14.942
- Yeah. whatever.

1032
00:59:16.422 --> 00:59:17.292
Tell you what.

1040
00:59:38.313 --> 00:59:39.488
- "Harry." for short.

1041
00:59:40.664 --> 00:59:41.926
- Yeah. all right.

1042
00:59:42.056 --> 00:59:43.841
That's enough time-wasting.

1043
00:59:43.971 --> 00:59:45.582
You best get chucking some rocks
in there.

1044
00:59:45.712 --> 00:59:47.496
see if it's gonna work.

1045
00:59:47.627 --> 00:59:48.672

It's working.

1054
01:00:25.926 --> 01:00:26.927
- Chuck another one!

1055
01:00:28.059 --> 01:00:29.887
- I suggest you don't shout.

1056
01:00:30.017 --> 01:00:31.497
They may be able to hear you.

This may be your best chance.

01:01:55.494 --> 01:01:57.452
- He's gone bleedin' mad.

[music crescendos]

1075
01:02:09.813 --> 01:02:10.857
- [Harris] I've got it!

1076
01:02:10.988 --> 01:02:13.555
- Oh. thank God for that!

1077
01:02:13.686 --> 01:02:15.209
[leaves crunching]

1078
01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:18.343
I can't see where the bloody
crocodiles are anyway.

[crocodiles splashing in water]

1081

[crocodile splashing]

1084
01:02:40.191 --> 01:02:42.019
- You. you saved my life. Jack.

1085
01:02:42.149 --> 01:02:43.194
- Oh. shut it!

1086
01:02:43.324 --> 01:02:45.065
It's just a scratch.

1087
01:02:45.196 --> 01:02:47.415
[Harris panting]

1088
01:02:47.546 --> 01:02:50.592
- It would have dragged
me in just like Pike.

1089
01:02:50.723 --> 01:02:53.552
[Harris gasping]

1090
01:02:54.379 --> 01:02:56.381
- Come on. we've gotta keep
moving.

1091
01:02:57.817 --> 01:02:59.688
That sun's going down and I'd
rather

1092
01:02:59.819 --> 01:03:01.690
spend the night away from that
water.

1093
01:03:03.736 --> 01:03:05.912
- I don't think I can get up.
Jack.

1094
01:03:06.043 --> 01:03:07.479
- Yes you can!

1095
01:03:07.609 --> 01:03:09.046
It's not that far.

1096
01:03:09.176 --> 01:03:11.875
And when we get there I'll light
a fire

1097
01:03:12.005 --> 01:03:13.354
and that'll keep them away.

1098
01:03:13.485 --> 01:03:15.922
[crocodile growling]

1099
01:03:16.053 --> 01:03:17.271
- Or bring them nearer.

1100
01:03:20.579 --> 01:03:22.059
[Singh whimpers]

1101
01:03:22.189 --> 01:03:23.930

[Singh grunts]

1107
01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:58.704
- How's the leg?

1108
01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:01.576
- Not better. not worse.

1109
01:04:01.707 --> 01:04:03.187
- That's good.

1110
01:04:03.317 --> 01:04:06.277
Be alright in the morning
when you've had a bit of kip.

1111
01:04:06.407 --> 01:04:08.932
[Singh grunts]

1112
01:04:13.414 --> 01:04:15.199
- Tell me something. Jack.

1113
01:04:16.156 --> 01:04:18.376
There's something I don't
understand.

1114
01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.291
- What?

1115
01:04:21.770 --> 01:04:23.424
- It really surprised me.

1116
01:04:23.555 --> 01:04:25.774
Your reaction to what happened
to.

1117
01:04:25.905 --> 01:04:27.124
to young Pike.

1118
01:04:30.475 --> 01:04:32.564
I can understand your
explanation.

1119
01:04:33.913 --> 01:04:37.134
but I never imaged your
saw him like a brother

1120
01:04:37.264 --> 01:04:39.963
because you never had a
kind word to say to him.

1121
01:04:41.268 --> 01:04:42.139
- Kind word?

1122
01:04:43.575 --> 01:04:47.231
- What I mean is. you would
always make jokes about him.

1123
01:04:47.361 --> 01:04:48.754
or have a laugh at his expense.

1124
01:04:48.885 --> 01:04:49.755
- Oh. that.

1125
01:04:51.670 --> 01:04:54.803
Listen. Harry. you wouldn't
understand.

1126
01:04:55.761 --> 01:04:57.154
It's a British thing.

1127
01:04:57.284 --> 01:04:58.372
It's what we do.

1128
01:04:58.503 --> 01:05:00.113
- A British thing?

1129
01:05:00.244 --> 01:05:01.680
It's called. "Taking the piss."

1130
01:05:01.810 --> 01:05:03.421
Having a laugh.

1131
01:05:03.551 --> 01:05:04.335
A bit of banter.

1132
01:05:04.465 --> 01:05:05.336
That's all.

1133
01:05:06.206 --> 01:05:07.555
- Banter?

1134
01:05:07.686 --> 01:05:09.993
- It's how you know who your
mates are.

1135
01:05:10.123 --> 01:05:12.952
When you can have a bit of
banter.

1136
01:05:14.345 --> 01:05:16.303
It's like a show of affection I
suppose.

1137
01:05:17.914 --> 01:05:20.394
- Oh. I see.

1138
01:05:20.525 --> 01:05:23.920
Now I understand why
you used to shout at me

1139
01:05:24.050 --> 01:05:26.574
and accuse me of doing certain
things.

1140
01:05:26.705 --> 01:05:30.143
Because you felt I was
like a brother to you!

1141
01:05:30.274 --> 01:05:31.101
- No!

1142
01:05:36.323 --> 01:05:37.194
I. um...

1143
01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.849
[Harris sighs]
Yeah. that was it.

1144
01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:43.852
I should've known you wouldn't
understand.

1145
01:05:45.550 --> 01:05:48.901
- It's okay. I get it now.

1146
01:05:49.032 --> 01:05:50.294
You bloody stupid English idiot!

1147
01:05:50.424 --> 01:05:52.035
- Oi! Watch it!

1148
01:05:53.558 --> 01:05:55.212
There are ways of doing it.

1149
01:06:00.869 --> 01:06:02.349
[Singh grunts]

1150
01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:05.178
[dramatic music]

1151
01:06:05.309 --> 01:06:07.964
[birds calling]

1152
01:06:37.558 --> 01:06:38.429
- Fuck me!

1153
01:06:39.647 --> 01:06:40.387
- What is it?

1154
01:06:40.518 --> 01:06:41.345
- Look at this!

1155
01:06:42.563 --> 01:06:43.564
[Singh yawns]

1156
01:06:43.695 --> 01:06:45.436
That's the route we were meant
to take!

1157
01:06:47.394 --> 01:06:49.788
The Sarge marked on there
where we turned east

1158
01:06:49.918 --> 01:06:50.789
into the swamp.

1159
01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.010
That is the route we were meant
to take.

1160
01:06:55.272 --> 01:06:57.361
And if you follow a straight
line east

1161
01:06:57.491 --> 01:06:59.754
there's a tiny little island

1162
01:06:59.885 --> 01:07:01.104
and that's where we are.

1163
01:07:02.453 --> 01:07:04.020
And if you go further east

1164
01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:06.631
there's that bleedin' Japanese
base.

1165
01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:10.069
It's less than half a mile away
from here.

1166
01:07:10.983 --> 01:07:12.028
We're nearly there.

1167
01:07:17.816 --> 01:07:20.993
If they've got any lights we'll
be able to see it from here.

1168
01:07:21.124 --> 01:07:22.081
- Which way's east?

1169
01:07:22.951 --> 01:07:24.214
- I don't know.

1170
01:07:24.344 --> 01:07:26.651
- Can't you tell from
the stars. or something?

1171
01:07:26.781 --> 01:07:29.828
- My eyes are a little blurry.

1172
01:07:29.958 --> 01:07:30.655
- Oh forget it.

1173
01:07:30.785 --> 01:07:31.656
Where's the compass?

1174
01:07:32.570 --> 01:07:36.095
- Uh. it was here in the
morning.

1175
01:07:36.226 --> 01:07:37.923
- So what happened to it?

1176
01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:39.359
- It was in my hand!

1177
01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:40.317
- [Harris] When?

1178
01:07:42.319 --> 01:07:43.972
- When we were fighting.

1179
01:07:44.103 --> 01:07:46.018
- Are you bleedin' kidding me?

1180
01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:48.281
After what we went
through to get that map?

1181
01:07:49.326 --> 01:07:51.154
We were that close!

1182
01:07:51.284 --> 01:07:53.982
[birds calling]

1183
01:07:58.291 --> 01:07:59.640
- I'm really sorry to say.

1184
01:08:01.686 --> 01:08:04.297
I'm not going to be able
to make it that far anyway.

1185
01:08:05.646 --> 01:08:06.778
Not through the water

1186
01:08:07.996 --> 01:08:08.867
with this leg.

1187
01:08:13.393 --> 01:08:16.962
[leaves crunching underfoot]

1188
01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:21.314
- Listen. Harry. I tell you
what.

1189
01:08:23.708 --> 01:08:28.321
You wait here and tomorrow
I'll go back to where we first

1190
01:08:28.452 --> 01:08:29.627
came out of that water.

1191
01:08:30.715 --> 01:08:33.457
[Harris sighs]

1192
01:08:33.587 --> 01:08:35.111
I'll make a straight line east

1193
01:08:36.503 --> 01:08:37.722
and I'll find that base.

1194
01:08:39.158 --> 01:08:40.986
And then I'll find the munitions
dump

1195
01:08:42.335 --> 01:08:43.075
[Harris sighs]

1196
01:08:43.206 --> 01:08:44.076
and I'll blow the fucker up

1197
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:46.513
with a couple of them grenades.

1198
01:08:50.604 --> 01:08:51.953
- And then what?

1199
01:08:52.954 --> 01:08:55.218
[Harris sighs]
And then while I'm gone

1200
01:08:56.262 --> 01:08:59.047
you find some sticks. build a
raft.

1201
01:09:00.179 --> 01:09:01.485
- This nice. big raft.

1202
01:09:02.355 --> 01:09:05.793
And then we can float out of
the swamp to the getaway boat.

1203
01:09:06.838 --> 01:09:09.841
And then we'll be back
in Singapore for supper.

1204
01:09:09.971 --> 01:09:10.885
How's that sound?

1205
01:09:18.023 --> 01:09:21.374
- I really appreciate your
optimism. Jack.

1206
01:09:21.505 --> 01:09:23.376
But you have to be realistic.

1207
01:09:24.856 --> 01:09:28.990
The description of these
events is very unlikely.

1208
01:09:30.035 --> 01:09:31.602
- We gotta try and do something!

1209
01:09:32.646 --> 01:09:34.953
Otherwise this has all
been a waste of time.

1210
01:09:35.083 --> 01:09:39.000
The Sarge. Pike. all for what?

1211
01:09:42.917 --> 01:09:44.397
And I'll tell you one thing.

1212
01:09:45.616 --> 01:09:47.052
I'm not quitting.

1213
01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:48.053
Not now.

1214
01:09:48.967 --> 01:09:50.273
We've come too fucking far.

1215
01:09:53.754 --> 01:09:54.625
[ominous music]

1216
01:09:54.755 --> 01:09:57.845
[crocodile growling]

1217
01:10:09.596 --> 01:10:12.469
- I was in this situation once
before.

1218
01:10:17.082 --> 01:10:18.388
- Five Rupees?

1219
01:10:18.518 --> 01:10:20.694
What's this? Indian money?

1220
01:10:20.825 --> 01:10:22.043
- No. look at it.

1221
01:10:22.914 --> 01:10:24.176
"Japanese Government".

1222
01:10:26.613 --> 01:10:29.529
When the Japanese invaded Burma.

1223
01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:31.401
they imposed their own currency.

1224
01:10:31.531 --> 01:10:33.403
I was fighting out there.

1225
01:10:33.533 --> 01:10:38.321
I found this and decided
to keep it as a souvenir.

1226
01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.019
- That's the bleedin'
Japanese for you. innit?

1227
01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:42.325
[Harris sniggers]

1228
01:10:42.455 --> 01:10:44.501
It's their way of showing you
who's boss.

1229
01:10:44.631 --> 01:10:46.981
"We're running the bleedin'
country now. mate".

1230
01:10:48.418 --> 01:10:50.071
- You're probably right.

1231
01:10:50.202 --> 01:10:51.334
- Bloody Japs.

1232
01:10:51.464 --> 01:10:54.511
- But it was the same in 1835

1233
01:10:54.641 --> 01:10:57.035
when the British imposed
the Indian Coinage Act.

1234
01:10:58.166 --> 01:11:00.908
They said that all the Indian
currency

1235
01:11:01.039 --> 01:11:03.694
will have to bear the face
of the King of England.

1236
01:11:03.824 --> 01:11:04.782
- Well that was different.

1237
01:11:04.912 --> 01:11:06.523
We weren't at war then.

1238
01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:08.742
Anyway. India was a bloody mess

1239
01:11:08.873 --> 01:11:10.657
before we came in and sorted it
out.

1240
01:11:11.963 --> 01:11:15.140
- Perhaps that it what Mr
Hitler thought of Poland?

1241
01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:16.141
- You what?

1242
01:11:17.098 --> 01:11:19.275
- Please don't misunderstand me.
Jack.

1243
01:11:19.405 --> 01:11:23.888
As you know. my family
business benefited hugely

1244
01:11:24.018 --> 01:11:25.803
by trading with the British
Empire.

1245
01:11:27.326 --> 01:11:29.372
It was my father who encouraged
me

1246
01:11:29.502 --> 01:11:31.461
to join the Volunteer Army.

1247
01:11:31.591 --> 01:11:34.028
He said we owed the British a
huge debt.

1248
01:11:37.684 --> 01:11:39.686
- What were you doing in Burma?

1249
01:11:39.817 --> 01:11:42.428
- They called it. "Operation
Longcloth."

1250
01:11:42.559 --> 01:11:45.170
- You were on Operation
Longcloth?

1251
01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:46.345
- You've heard of it?

1252
01:11:46.476 --> 01:11:47.651
- Of course.

1253
01:11:47.781 --> 01:11:49.305
It was all in the papers.

1254
01:11:49.435 --> 01:11:53.613
Major General Wingate going on
about what a success it was.

1255
01:11:53.744 --> 01:11:55.702
- Huh! It was terrible.

1256
01:11:59.184 --> 01:12:00.925
We were amongst the first in.

1257
01:12:02.535 --> 01:12:05.277
"Long-range penetration." they
called it.

1258
01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:10.587
We were ordered to cross
the Irrawaddy River.

1259
01:12:10.717 --> 01:12:12.023
deep into Burma.

1260
01:12:13.807 --> 01:12:15.983
Our column was the first to
cross it

1261
01:12:16.114 --> 01:12:19.291
and then we decided to sit
and wait for the others.

1262
01:12:21.075 --> 01:12:23.556
But then the orders changed.

1263
01:12:23.687 --> 01:12:25.602
Wingate was ordered to withdraw.

1264
01:12:27.821 --> 01:12:30.737
We were left stranded on
the wrong side of the river

1265
01:12:30.868 --> 01:12:34.611
with limited supplies and
the Japanese hunting us down.

1266
01:12:37.222 --> 01:12:40.051
We were deep into enemy
territory.

1267
01:12:40.181 --> 01:12:43.794
just like you and I are now.

1268
01:12:46.971 --> 01:12:47.972
- Then what happened?

1269
01:12:50.322 --> 01:12:52.237
- We had to abandon all our
equipment.

1270
01:12:54.413 --> 01:12:55.980
And once the supplies ran out.

1271
01:12:56.894 --> 01:12:59.462
we were instructed to eat our
horses.

1272
01:13:02.595 --> 01:13:03.727
I refused.

1273
01:13:05.032 --> 01:13:09.297
Eventually. I used that
horse to cross the river.

1274
01:13:10.951 --> 01:13:14.999
I made it. but a lot of them
didn't.

1275
01:13:16.348 --> 01:13:21.309
I believe we lost a thousand men
over all.

1276
01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:23.964
- Christ. they didn't
print that in the papers.

1277
01:13:24.095 --> 01:13:26.793
[birds calling]

1278
01:13:29.187 --> 01:13:30.318
- You keep it.

1279
01:13:31.319 --> 01:13:32.886
- It's your souvenir.

1280
01:13:33.017 --> 01:13:35.889
- I believe you have a
slightly better chance than me

1281
01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:37.717
of making it off this island.

1282
01:13:44.507 --> 01:13:45.943
- I've got something in here for
you.

1283
01:13:49.729 --> 01:13:50.513
Try that.

1284
01:13:52.166 --> 01:13:53.341
- What is that?

1285
01:13:53.472 --> 01:13:54.430
- American gum.

1286
01:13:55.909 --> 01:13:57.171
You ever tried it before?

1287
01:13:58.085 --> 01:14:00.261
- I don't believe I've
ever had the pleasure.

1288
01:14:01.567 --> 01:14:03.569
- There you go.

1289
01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.484
- Are you sure. Jack?

1290
01:14:05.615 --> 01:14:06.442
- Of course.

1291
01:14:07.965 --> 01:14:09.053
- Thank you very much.

1292
01:14:18.976 --> 01:14:22.893
- Mm. very unusual flavor.

1293
01:14:25.852 --> 01:14:27.419
- Did you just swallow it?

1294
01:14:27.550 --> 01:14:29.639
- Yes. very. very tasty.

1295
01:14:29.769 --> 01:14:31.467
- You're not meant to swallow
it!

1296
01:14:32.772 --> 01:14:34.295
I wanted that back!

1297
01:14:34.426 --> 01:14:36.080
I could've made that last a
week!

1298
01:14:41.912 --> 01:14:46.525
- What's that?
[dramatic music]

1299
01:14:46.656 --> 01:14:51.399
[Harris panting]
- There's something out there!

1300
01:14:51.530 --> 01:14:52.792
- A Japanese patrol!

1301
01:14:52.923 --> 01:14:53.880
[crocodile growling softly]

1302
01:14:54.011 --> 01:14:55.316
- I doubt it.

1303
01:14:55.447 --> 01:14:56.796
One thing I'll say about the
Japanese.

1304
01:14:56.927 --> 01:14:59.320
is they ain't stupid.

1305
01:14:59.451 --> 01:15:00.539
And they're not gonna go
marching

1306
01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:02.323
into a swamp full of bloody
crocodiles.

1307
01:15:03.934 --> 01:15:04.891
Not like we did.

1308
01:15:05.718 --> 01:15:08.504
[dramatic music]

1309
01:15:10.593 --> 01:15:12.072
- What if they did?

1310
01:15:12.203 --> 01:15:13.117
- You what?

1311
01:15:14.422 --> 01:15:18.470
- I never finished telling
you about Operation Longcloth.

1312
01:15:18.601 --> 01:15:19.819
- Well you'd better hurry up.

1313
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:21.212
I think we've got company.

1314
01:15:22.953 --> 01:15:26.652
- It was a horrible failure.
but there was one positive.

1315
01:15:27.479 --> 01:15:32.266
The Japanese sent out three
whole divisions to hunt us down.

1316
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:35.748
That left them very short of
men.

1317
01:15:35.879 --> 01:15:38.446
so when they attempted to invade
India

1318
01:15:38.577 --> 01:15:39.883
they miserably failed.

1319
01:15:41.014 --> 01:15:42.886
- Shit! There's one of them!

1320
01:15:43.016 --> 01:15:44.670
I think we're in trouble. mate.

1321
01:15:44.801 --> 01:15:45.889
- Are you listening to me. Jack?

1322
01:15:46.019 --> 01:15:48.239
- Yeah. we beat 'em out of
India.

1323
01:15:48.369 --> 01:15:51.808
- What are you getting at?

1324
01:15:51.938 --> 01:15:55.725
- Well. sometimes you can fail
and still make a difference.

1325
01:15:56.856 --> 01:15:59.163
Oh Christ. there's another one!

1326
01:15:59.293 --> 01:16:00.947
- Listen to me. Jack!

1327
01:16:01.078 --> 01:16:03.820
We agreed if the Japanese hear a
gun

1328
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:06.518
they will send a patrol to
investigate.

1329
01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:09.739
But what if they hear
a few of these go off?

1330
01:16:12.524 --> 01:16:14.395
They will think they're under
attack

1331
01:16:14.526 --> 01:16:18.269
and they might just send
out a whole division!

1332
01:16:19.705 --> 01:16:21.533
- Into a swamp full of
crocodiles?

1333
01:16:21.664 --> 01:16:23.143
That'd be a bleedin' massacre.

1334
01:16:23.274 --> 01:16:24.144
- Right!

1335
01:16:24.971 --> 01:16:28.801
[victorious instrumental music]

1336
01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:32.326
- If I have to go down.
I'm going down fighting.

1337
01:16:32.457 --> 01:16:35.155
And if I can take out a whole
division of Japs with me.

1338
01:16:35.286 --> 01:16:36.243
that's even better.

1339
01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:38.681
Give me the bag.

1340
01:16:40.683 --> 01:16:41.684
- [Singh] Look out!

1341
01:16:41.814 --> 01:16:43.381
[gunshots ringing]

1342
01:16:43.511 --> 01:16:44.600

[gunshots ringing]

1344
01:16:48.038 --> 01:16:48.734
I knew it!

1345
01:16:48.865 --> 01:16:50.040
I knew they'd come.

1346
01:16:50.170 --> 01:16:51.868
- They've got a taste
for us now. ain't they?

1347
01:16:54.218 --> 01:16:55.132
I wonder if they like Japanese
meat

1348
01:16:55.262 --> 01:16:56.437
like they like the English?

1349
01:16:56.568 --> 01:16:58.788
- They seem to like a
bit of Indian all right.

1350
01:17:01.007 --> 01:17:03.140
Look out. it's coming back!

1351
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:04.054
- Well it ain't gonna come back

1352
01:17:04.184 --> 01:17:05.577
when he gets a taste of this.

1353
01:17:10.321 --> 01:17:11.627
[Harris grunts]

1354

You hear that you bloody Japs?

1355
01:17:16.719 --> 01:17:18.721
There's more where that came
from.

1356
01:17:18.851 --> 01:17:20.984
Come and get us if you've got
the guts.

1357

Or else it'll take you as well!
