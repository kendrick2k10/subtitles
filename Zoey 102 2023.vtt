181
00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:12.432
See you on the ice.
Meeting adjourned.

[spirited music playing]

184
00:07:17.671 --> 00:07:20.608
-Siri. start my treadmill.
-Kelley. I need to talk to you.

185
00:07:20.707 --> 00:07:22.743
Okay. I'm super busy.
so make it quick please.

186
00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:24.578
It's about your selections
for live finale.

187
00:07:24.678 --> 00:07:26.179
I think you're making
a big mistake.

188
00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.215
Pink or hot pink
for the new girl?

189
00:07:29.082 --> 00:07:30.584
-Nude.
-She can't be naked.

190
00:07:30.684 --> 00:07:32.953
No. no. it's a color.
The color nude.

191
00:07:33.053 --> 00:07:36.389
Do I have to do
everyone's job around here?!

192
00:07:37.224 --> 00:07:38.291
[Zoey sighs]

193
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.227
I would be such
a valuable member of the team

194
00:07:40.327 --> 00:07:42.530
because I've worked on the show
longer than anyone.

195
00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.465
-All the contestants trust me.
-Mr. Kevyn. question from Legal.

196
00:07:45.566 --> 00:07:48.068
Did we ever get permission
to use Pontiac for the car?

197
00:07:48.168 --> 00:07:50.270
We are the number one show
on the network.

198
00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:53.006
We don't ask Pontiac.
we tell them.

199
00:07:53.106 --> 00:07:55.207
In fact. tell Pontiac.
if they don't like it.

200
00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:58.345
they can kiss
my tiny little nuts.

201
00:07:58.445 --> 00:07:59.713
You done or you still need me?

202
00:07:59.813 --> 00:08:02.015
I have better ideas
than any of the guys!

203
00:08:02.115 --> 00:08:04.184
The proposal was my idea!

204
00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:06.153
Look. Debbie.

205
00:08:06.253 --> 00:08:08.889
if you don't like your job.
I can get you a new one.

206
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:10.891
Submission tape duty.

207
00:08:10.991 --> 00:08:12.492
Wait. no. no. that is not--

208
00:08:12.593 --> 00:08:15.563
Submission tape duty!

00:08:15.663 --> 00:08:18.566

212
00:08:24.437 --> 00:08:26.006
[Zoey] Not today. please.

-[ignition failing to start]
-Please.

214

[fans yelling excitedly]

216
00:08:32.145 --> 00:08:34.280
This is a closed set.
I want to let you guys know.

217
00:08:34.381 --> 00:08:37.017
I don't love that photo.
to be honest. I'll sign this.

218
00:08:37.116 --> 00:08:38.919
I do have to leave
in about two seconds.

219
00:08:39.019 --> 00:08:41.254
-But it's like the best picture!
-All right.

220
00:08:43.155 --> 00:08:44.290

[car beeps to mimic

222
00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:47.294
Oh my God.

223
00:08:47.394 --> 00:08:48.495
Need a ride?

224
00:08:48.596 --> 00:08:51.231
[whimsical music playing]

225
00:08:52.032 --> 00:08:53.767
Oh. come on. cheer up.

226
00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:55.703
This is what happens
when you still drive

227
00:08:55.803 --> 00:08:58.371
your dad's PT Cruiser.
from high school.

228
00:08:59.072 --> 00:09:01.041
You're gonna need
a new car. babe.

229
00:09:01.809 --> 00:09:03.376
I'm fine. I like my car.

230
00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:06.379
Isn't it crazy
that I started as your intern.

231
00:09:06.479 --> 00:09:09.116
and now like. we're...
like. I'm like...

232
00:09:09.216 --> 00:09:11.418
like a little above...
like it's crazy.

233
00:09:11.518 --> 00:09:14.588
What's crazy is that Kelley
lets you take home the show car

234
00:09:14.688 --> 00:09:16.089
but I can't even get him
to look at me.

235
00:09:16.189 --> 00:09:18.626
That's because Kelley
is obsessed with me.

236
00:09:18.726 --> 00:09:19.827
It would be like gross

237
00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:21.561
if it didn't come
with some perks.

238
00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:22.996
I just think
about all the things

239
00:09:23.096 --> 00:09:24.698
I dreamed about
in high school.

240
00:09:24.798 --> 00:09:26.466
and now I'm here.
and it's like.

241
00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.068
is this it. is this the dream?

242
00:09:28.602 --> 00:09:31.338
It's really gross how often
you talk about high school.

243
00:09:31.438 --> 00:09:33.674
[soft music playing]

244
00:09:33.774 --> 00:09:36.309
No. but seriously.
just break the rules.

245
00:09:36.409 --> 00:09:38.411
There are two types
of people. right?

246
00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:40.147
Sharks and minnows.

247
00:09:41.548 --> 00:09:43.183
I'm obviously a shark.

248
00:09:43.283 --> 00:09:44.852
and you're-you're a minnow.

249
00:09:44.952 --> 00:09:45.886
I'm not a minnow.

250
00:09:45.986 --> 00:09:47.988
Okay. then prove it.

251
00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:50.891
If you want Kelley's attention.
just do what I did.

252
00:09:50.991 --> 00:09:52.392
What did you do?

253
00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:55.295
I solicited him for nudes
and then I blackmailed him.

254
00:09:57.297 --> 00:09:59.432
[laughing]

255
00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:00.768
I'm joking!

256
00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:02.670
You're crazy!

257
00:10:02.770 --> 00:10:06.874
Um. no. I applied for the job.

258
00:10:09.843 --> 00:10:11.044
If it makes you feel better.

259
00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:13.546
I really thought
the promotion was yours.

260
00:10:13.647 --> 00:10:15.448
You deserve it more than anyone.

261
00:10:15.548 --> 00:10:17.117
including me.

262
00:10:17.217 --> 00:10:19.119
I make way too much money.

-You wanna go to sushi?
-[ding]

264
00:10:21.221 --> 00:10:22.956
Take me to SUGARFISH.

to SUGARFISH.

267
00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.028
It's totally fine.

268
00:10:28.128 --> 00:10:29.930
This drives itself.
we can just relax.

269
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:31.231
Sit back. relax.

-Hi!

-Did you get it?
-The promotion? No.

Sexism is still alive and well
in Hollywood. baby!

What?!

Those idiots.

280

But no. the package.
I meant the package.

Oh. uh. yeah.

00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:18.245
-Five minutes. Ms. Pensky.
-Thank you.

283
00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:20.580
You in London? I thought your
keynote wasn't 'til next week.

284
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.249
We're pre-taping it
for the product launch.

285
00:11:22.349 --> 00:11:24.017
Open it.
I only have a few minutes.

286
00:11:25.485 --> 00:11:28.255
The new TekMate?!
These aren't even out yet!

287
00:11:28.355 --> 00:11:30.290
I guess it pays
to know the inventor!

288
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:32.425
Don't you want to turn it on?

Wow. the unbreakable
see-through phone.

291

It's even better in person!

[laughs]
Oh my God.

293
00:11:39.499 --> 00:11:41.969
Did I tell you that I got
proposed to the other night

294
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:44.037
on a second date?

295
00:11:44.137 --> 00:11:45.505
It's like the second we turn 30.

296
00:11:45.605 --> 00:11:48.275
everybody just
becomes obsessed with...

297
00:11:49.309 --> 00:11:51.344
"Will you be my maid..."

298
00:11:51.444 --> 00:11:52.512
Wait. what is...

299
00:11:52.612 --> 00:11:53.747
No.

300
00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:54.915
Shut up!

00:11:55.015 --> 00:11:56.683

and surprised me with a trip

to the Netherlands.
He even chartered a plane.

305
00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.893
which is so environmentally
irresponsible. but...

306
00:12:05.993 --> 00:12:07.694
-Of course he did!
-Of course he did!

307
00:12:07.795 --> 00:12:09.029
So. I just called Michael.

308
00:12:09.129 --> 00:12:10.898
and he is obsessed
with being the officiant.

309
00:12:10.998 --> 00:12:14.501
And I got off the phone with
Chase. and he is freaking out!

310
00:12:14.601 --> 00:12:17.004
Oh. Hi-hi. Zoey!

311

So you heard.

-She finally said yes!
-Hey. Logan!

313
00:12:20.573 --> 00:12:23.376
And it only took you 50 times.
Congrats!

314
00:12:23.476 --> 00:12:25.879
Okay. so I know it's
almost like too soon.

315
00:12:25.979 --> 00:12:27.815
but the wedding
has to be August 26th.

316
00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:29.582
Long story short.

317
00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:31.919
it's the only time I'm free
for the next two years.

318
00:12:32.019 --> 00:12:34.855
And I don't know what I'd do
without my best friend there.

319
00:12:34.955 --> 00:12:36.289
So what do you say?

320
00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:41.394
You know. I thought
I was gonna have to work.

321
00:12:41.494 --> 00:12:43.263
but looks like I'm totally free!

322
00:12:43.696 --> 00:12:46.699
Thank you. Hey. you wanna get me
a water before I go on?

323
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.568
Anything for my fiancee.

324
00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:52.005
Zo. you know
it's gonna be fine. right?

325
00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.241
Chase is gonna be there.
It's gonna be fine.

326
00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:56.343
More than fine.
it's gonna be fun.

327
00:12:56.443 --> 00:12:58.278
No one gets to see you anymore
except me.

328
00:12:58.378 --> 00:12:59.913
It'll be the reunion
we all need.

329
00:13:00.013 --> 00:13:01.181
I gotta go. love you.

[sighs]
I see people.

338
00:13:19.066 --> 00:13:20.600
Just because I haven't seen them
in a while

339
00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:22.235
doesn't mean we aren't friends.
right?

340
00:13:22.335 --> 00:13:24.237
I have a lot of friends.
see a lot of people.

341
00:13:24.337 --> 00:13:26.306
Even if I had the option.
I'm too busy.

342
00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:27.975
I'm really busy all the time.

* Held me back.

you'd stay the same *

00:13:54.567 --> 00:13:57.104
* You used to know me.
now you don't *

354
00:13:58.471 --> 00:14:02.242
* You used to hypnotize me.
did it so easy *

355
00:14:02.642 --> 00:14:05.045
* You used to know me.
now you don't *

356
00:14:05.145 --> 00:14:06.980
Of course I had questions.

357
00:14:07.447 --> 00:14:09.216
Who snuck into Sunday school?

358
00:14:09.316 --> 00:14:11.051
Who stole the Subaru?

359
00:14:11.451 --> 00:14:14.021
And who stabbed
Sarabella Samson?

360
00:14:14.754 --> 00:14:19.326
I'm Stacey Dillsen. and this
is My Favorite Slaughters.

361
00:14:20.994 --> 00:14:25.098
* I'm like a flower blooming
since I left you behind *

362
00:14:25.198 --> 00:14:27.034
* Don't know what I was doing *

363
00:14:27.134 --> 00:14:29.436
-Woo!
-Make a wish!

364
00:14:29.536 --> 00:14:33.573
* Knew you were turning evil.
you said I lost my mind *

365
00:14:33.673 --> 00:14:37.144
* No. you ain't gonna do me
like that *

366
00:14:37.244 --> 00:14:40.813
* Held me back.
tied me up inside a cage *

367
00:14:40.914 --> 00:14:42.615
* Had to change my life *

368
00:14:42.715 --> 00:14:45.518
* 'Cause I knew
you'd stay the same... *

369
00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:47.887
[laughter]

370
00:14:47.988 --> 00:14:49.622
Is there shellfish in this?

371
00:14:49.722 --> 00:14:50.924
[all shouting]

372
00:14:51.925 --> 00:14:52.926
No shellfish!

373
00:14:53.026 --> 00:14:54.394
* Now you don't *

374
00:14:55.762 --> 00:14:59.299
* You used to hypnotize me.
did it so easy *

375
00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:02.502
* You used to know me.
now you don't *

376
00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.304
[yawns]

377
00:15:15.482 --> 00:15:19.119
* Don't go through
your camera roll *

378
00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:22.055
* So much you don't know *

379
00:15:22.522 --> 00:15:25.825
* That you've forgotten *

380
00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:27.194
* What a trip *

381
00:15:27.627 --> 00:15:29.629
* The way you can flip *

382
00:15:29.729 --> 00:15:32.465
* Through all
the good parts of it *

383
00:15:32.565 --> 00:15:36.303
* I shouldn't have done it *

384
00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:39.039
* Chronological order *

385
00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:41.408
* And nothing but torture *

386
00:15:41.508 --> 00:15:43.443
* Scroll too far back... *

387
00:15:43.543 --> 00:15:45.445
[Zoey]

388
00:15:47.014 --> 00:15:49.482
* I don't want to see 'em *

389
00:15:49.582 --> 00:15:52.085
* But I can't delete 'em... *

390
00:15:52.185 --> 00:15:54.887
What's goin' on?
Yeah. give it to me.

391
00:15:55.355 --> 00:15:58.225
Psh! Nice work.
Yeah? Okay. here we go.

392
00:15:59.626 --> 00:16:01.228
Oh. yeah. You're good at that.

393
00:16:01.328 --> 00:16:03.796
Oh. yeah. you wanna fistbump?
Let's go. All right.

394
00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:09.469
* All the best *

395
00:16:10.537 --> 00:16:12.772
[Zoey]

396
00:16:18.178 --> 00:16:20.613
Chase. I'm really sorry
about Hawaii.

397
00:16:20.713 --> 00:16:23.583
But we were kids.
Can we talk?

398
00:16:26.253 --> 00:16:28.055
[Zoey]

399
00:16:28.521 --> 00:16:30.557
Oh. no. no. no. no.

400
00:16:34.427 --> 00:16:35.928
Oh. no. Oh...

401
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:44.771
[dings]

402
00:16:48.875 --> 00:16:50.610
[electricity buzzing]

403
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:53.080
[Archer] You're watching
LOVE: Fully Charged.

404
00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.315
No peeking. No peeking.
No peeking.

405
00:16:55.415 --> 00:16:56.983
Okay. hang on. Hang on.

406
00:16:57.084 --> 00:17:00.187
You ready? Three. two. one.

407
00:17:00.287 --> 00:17:02.389
-Ta-da!
-[all cheer]

408
00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:06.193
Jordan B.. what's going on?
Did you do all this?

409
00:17:06.292 --> 00:17:07.560
No.

410
00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:10.463
I mean. yes.

411
00:17:10.563 --> 00:17:13.566
Jordyn J.. I know it's only
our second date.

412
00:17:13.665 --> 00:17:15.867
but there's something
I want to ask you.

413
00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:17.337
Oh. my God.

414
00:17:17.436 --> 00:17:18.905
Oh my God!

415
00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:21.708
Yeah?

416
00:17:22.509 --> 00:17:23.976
-[music ends]
-[nearby chatter]

417
00:17:24.077 --> 00:17:25.545
Um...

418
00:17:25.978 --> 00:17:27.314
Yes?

419
00:17:27.946 --> 00:17:29.082
Um...

420
00:17:29.782 --> 00:17:30.583
Um...

421
00:17:30.683 --> 00:17:32.051
[Kelley]
What is wrong with him?

422
00:17:32.152 --> 00:17:33.253
[Jordan B.]
Um...

423
00:17:33.353 --> 00:17:34.487
Greg. what is wrong with him?

424
00:17:34.587 --> 00:17:36.123
I don't know.
He's never like this.

425
00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:39.992
Yo. I'm so sorry. but before
I do this. can I talk to Zoey?

426
00:17:40.093 --> 00:17:41.794
Who the hell is Zoey?

427
00:17:41.894 --> 00:17:43.163
Ah!

428
00:17:43.663 --> 00:17:46.966
[inhales and exhales slowly]

429
00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.437
Zoey. you embarrassed me.

430
00:17:50.537 --> 00:17:52.805
The network loved Greg's idea
of the proposal.

431
00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:54.941
and then Jordan B. goes
on one knee and is like.

432
00:17:55.041 --> 00:17:58.745
"Uh. I need Zoey. Where's Zoey?
Zoey. where's Zoey?"

433
00:18:00.513 --> 00:18:02.682
Well. where were you. Zoey?

434
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:05.218
You put me on
submission tape duty.

435
00:18:05.785 --> 00:18:07.887
You are not here to answer.

436
00:18:07.987 --> 00:18:09.956
You are here to listen.

437
00:18:10.357 --> 00:18:13.393
I do not like Jordan B.

438
00:18:13.493 --> 00:18:15.428
He acts like a baby.

439
00:18:15.528 --> 00:18:17.797
But America disagrees.

440
00:18:18.165 --> 00:18:19.199
It's probably the hair.

441
00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:20.967
And if my prediction is right.

442
00:18:21.568 --> 00:18:23.069
he's gonna go to the finals.

443
00:18:23.736 --> 00:18:26.639
And when he does.
I need you...

444
00:18:27.407 --> 00:18:28.641
to be...

445
00:18:29.242 --> 00:18:30.477
his mommy.

446
00:18:31.178 --> 00:18:32.212
Mommy?

447
00:18:32.645 --> 00:18:33.880
-Yes.
-[joints creak]

448
00:18:34.381 --> 00:18:35.815
[yelps]

449
00:18:38.551 --> 00:18:41.288
When he is "hungy."
you will feed him.

450
00:18:41.388 --> 00:18:44.891
When he is crabby.
you will check his diapey.

451
00:18:44.991 --> 00:18:46.559
And when we go live.

452
00:18:46.659 --> 00:18:50.697
you will be in his ears
telling him exactly what to say.

453
00:18:50.797 --> 00:18:55.368
because I will not
be embarrassed again.

454
00:18:55.868 --> 00:18:57.370
Does this mean
I'm on the live team?

455
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.439
-Yeah. fine. on the live team.
-Yes!

456
00:19:00.273 --> 00:19:01.841
Oh. God.

457
00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:07.347
No. uh. wait. I cannot tell you
how long I waited to do this.

458
00:19:07.447 --> 00:19:08.948
but I don't know if I can accept

459
00:19:09.048 --> 00:19:11.218
because it is the same weekend
as my best friend's wedding--

460
00:19:11.318 --> 00:19:12.852
I was not asking. okay?

461
00:19:12.952 --> 00:19:15.722
Whatever your plans are.
cancel. okay?

462
00:19:15.822 --> 00:19:16.923
You're busy.

463
00:19:18.725 --> 00:19:20.893
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

464
00:19:22.962 --> 00:19:23.930
[exhales]

465
00:19:24.030 --> 00:19:25.031
One more.

466
00:19:25.131 --> 00:19:27.500
[sighs] One for the one.
Just a little one.

467
00:19:29.369 --> 00:19:30.337
[groans]

468
00:19:30.437 --> 00:19:32.572
[gentle music playing]

469
00:19:38.645 --> 00:19:41.881
Quinn. it's me.
your maid of honor.

470
00:19:42.749 --> 00:19:44.517
I can't come to your wedding.

471
00:19:44.617 --> 00:19:46.353
I know it's the most
important day of your life.

472
00:19:46.453 --> 00:19:47.820
but I have to work.

473
00:19:48.421 --> 00:19:50.022
Oh. I hate this.

474
00:19:50.122 --> 00:19:51.458
-Zoey!
-[gasps]

475
00:19:51.558 --> 00:19:53.192
-Hi! Oh!
-Hi!

476
00:19:53.693 --> 00:19:55.662
Oh. my God.
I'm so glad you're here.

477
00:19:55.762 --> 00:19:57.430
My family's already
driving me nuts.

478
00:19:57.530 --> 00:19:58.798
Bubbe says I'm too pale.

479
00:19:58.898 --> 00:20:00.467
My mom thinks I should add
a belt to the dress.

480
00:20:00.567 --> 00:20:02.235
-And Logan's sister Lyric is--
-Quinn.

481
00:20:02.335 --> 00:20:03.703
-Lyric. Hi.
-I need to talk to you

482
00:20:03.803 --> 00:20:05.137
-about your wedding present.
-Right now?

483
00:20:05.238 --> 00:20:06.239
Yes.

484
00:20:06.339 --> 00:20:07.274
My gift is an original song.

485
00:20:07.374 --> 00:20:08.475
That is so thoughtful.

486
00:20:08.575 --> 00:20:10.243
That I will be performing

487
00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.111
as you walk down the aisle.

488
00:20:13.913 --> 00:20:16.349
Lyric is an up-and-coming
singer/songwriter.

489
00:20:16.449 --> 00:20:18.585
I specialize
in EDM/deep house/country-folk.

490
00:20:18.685 --> 00:20:21.020
-It's like a whole thing.
-Lyric. about the gift--

491
00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.789
Shh.

492
00:20:23.656 --> 00:20:25.792
[vocalizing individual notes]

493
00:20:28.628 --> 00:20:30.263
Ooh. that's really good.

494
00:20:30.863 --> 00:20:32.832
Uh. sorry. the melody
just came to me.

495
00:20:33.766 --> 00:20:38.538
I need to lay this down.
Siri. open voice memos.

496
00:20:39.105 --> 00:20:40.573
What I would give
for the confidence

497
00:20:40.673 --> 00:20:42.275
of a trust fund kid.

498
00:20:43.543 --> 00:20:45.177
[sighs]
Um. Quinn.

499
00:20:45.278 --> 00:20:47.714
there is something I really
need to talk to you about.

500
00:20:47.814 --> 00:20:49.382
Ready. Miss Pensky?

501
00:20:49.482 --> 00:20:50.717
Oh.

502
00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:52.819
I'm sorry. I-- I gotta go.

503
00:20:52.919 --> 00:20:55.021
-Talk later? Okay.
-Yeah. okay.

504
00:20:55.555 --> 00:20:56.823
Thank you.

505
00:21:00.159 --> 00:21:02.161
-[sighs]
-[Stacey] I hope she shows up.

506
00:21:02.261 --> 00:21:04.297
[Camille] Zoey? The maid
of honor? Why wouldn't she?

507
00:21:04.397 --> 00:21:05.598
[Stacey] Because she never
shows up.

508
00:21:05.698 --> 00:21:07.066
And it's not like we don't
invite her.

509
00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:09.135
Now that you mention it.
I worked with Quinn five years

510
00:21:09.235 --> 00:21:11.471
-and I still haven't met her.
-[Stacey] My theory is

511
00:21:11.571 --> 00:21:13.272
I think she's still stuck
on her ex. Chase.

512
00:21:13.373 --> 00:21:15.875
-[Camille] The best man?
-[Stacey] From high school.

513
00:21:15.975 --> 00:21:17.877
It's sad. They were supposed
to spend the summer

514
00:21:17.977 --> 00:21:20.813
after senior year together
in Hawaii.

515
00:21:20.913 --> 00:21:22.114
but something
must have happened.

516
00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:23.883
because they broke up.
and I don't think

517
00:21:23.983 --> 00:21:25.452
she's had a relationship since.

518
00:21:25.552 --> 00:21:26.919
[Camille]
Oh. no. Poor thing.

519
00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:29.055
And if she does show.
it's going to be uncomfortable.

520
00:21:29.155 --> 00:21:31.658
because I don't think she knows
Chase has a girlfriend.

521
00:21:31.758 --> 00:21:34.293
A serious one. We had dinner
with them in Baltimore

522
00:21:34.394 --> 00:21:36.095
when I was touring for my pod.

523
00:21:36.195 --> 00:21:37.229
She's a teacher too.

524
00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:38.565
They're so cute together.

525
00:21:38.665 --> 00:21:40.199
[exclaiming]

526
00:21:40.667 --> 00:21:42.435
-Oh. my goodness.
-Zoey?

527
00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:45.171
-Are you okay?
-I'm good. I'm so good.

528
00:21:46.939 --> 00:21:49.108
Your maid of honor
has arrived!

529
00:21:49.208 --> 00:21:50.977
-Hey!
-Hi!

530
00:21:51.611 --> 00:21:53.413
It looks like you could use
a little drink.

531
00:21:53.513 --> 00:21:54.981
Thank you.

532
00:21:56.048 --> 00:21:57.850
[gulping loudly]

533
00:22:00.052 --> 00:22:01.253
[sighs]

534
00:22:01.354 --> 00:22:02.622
[laughs]

535
00:22:02.722 --> 00:22:05.191
Miss Pensky.
you look beautiful!

536
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:07.059
It is so good to see you. Zoey.

537
00:22:07.159 --> 00:22:09.862
Oh. this is my mom.
Quinn's grandma.

538
00:22:09.962 --> 00:22:12.131
Not grandma. Never grandma.

539
00:22:12.231 --> 00:22:13.232
Bubbe.

540
00:22:13.332 --> 00:22:14.333
Nice to meet you.

541
00:22:14.434 --> 00:22:15.768
Well. how's your family?

542
00:22:15.868 --> 00:22:17.470
What is that little brother
of yours up to?

543
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.406
Not so little anymore.

544
00:22:19.506 --> 00:22:21.908
He has two kids and twins on
the way. if you can believe it.

545
00:22:22.008 --> 00:22:24.243
You all need to stop
growing up.

546
00:22:24.343 --> 00:22:26.112
-Mm-hmm.
-Zoey!

547
00:22:26.513 --> 00:22:29.315
-It's been so long!
-Hi. Stacey!

548
00:22:29.416 --> 00:22:31.083
[Zoey laughs]

549
00:22:31.183 --> 00:22:32.885
And you must be Camille.

550
00:22:32.985 --> 00:22:35.054
Yes. it's so nice
to finally meet you.

551
00:22:35.154 --> 00:22:37.924
We were just wondering whether
or not you were gonna make it.

552
00:22:38.024 --> 00:22:40.760
I know. I'm late. but I was at
my boyfriend's house.

553
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.395
Lost track of time.

554
00:22:42.495 --> 00:22:44.397
Boyfriend? Since when?

555
00:22:44.497 --> 00:22:45.765
It's recent.
but enough about me.

556
00:22:45.865 --> 00:22:48.300
Now. don't make us wait
until the wedding. Zoey.

557
00:22:48.401 --> 00:22:49.702
Come on. give us the deets.

558
00:22:49.802 --> 00:22:51.003
Yeah. yeah. What's his name?

559
00:22:51.103 --> 00:22:54.741
Uh. his... his name is. um...

560
00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:56.375
um...

561
00:22:56.476 --> 00:22:57.477
Hemsworth.

562
00:22:57.577 --> 00:22:59.211
Hugo Hemsworth.

563
00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:01.514
Hemsworth? Is he Australian?

564
00:23:01.614 --> 00:23:02.815
Yeah.

565
00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:05.885
Like Liam and Chris Hemsworth?

566
00:23:05.985 --> 00:23:07.954
They're distant cousins.

567
00:23:08.054 --> 00:23:09.722
-Oh! What does he do?
-What?

568
00:23:09.822 --> 00:23:12.425
He is a doctor.

569
00:23:12.525 --> 00:23:13.893
Surgeon. actually.

570
00:23:13.993 --> 00:23:16.095
-[Stacey] Wow!
-[Camille] Dr. Hemsworth.

571
00:23:16.195 --> 00:23:17.163
She's ready.

572
00:23:17.263 --> 00:23:18.431
Oh. thank God.

573
00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:22.101
[tender music playing]

574
00:23:22.201 --> 00:23:23.736
[all gasp]

575
00:23:26.639 --> 00:23:28.040
She looks great.

576
00:23:31.611 --> 00:23:33.112
You look amazing.

577
00:23:37.884 --> 00:23:39.418
How do you feel?

578
00:23:40.086 --> 00:23:42.221
Like I'd rather be getting
married in a lab coat.

579
00:23:42.689 --> 00:23:44.857
It's perfect. You're perfect.

580
00:23:44.957 --> 00:23:46.493
You're a little pale.

581
00:23:46.893 --> 00:23:48.260
Could use a belt.

582
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.962
[excited chatter]

583
00:23:51.898 --> 00:23:54.166
-I'll see you soon.
-All right. Bye!

584
00:23:54.266 --> 00:23:56.302
-Uh. hey. where's your car?
-Oh. it's in the shop.

585
00:23:56.402 --> 00:23:58.738
-Oh. Do you need a ride?
-That's so sweet.

586
00:23:58.838 --> 00:24:00.139
but my boyfriend's
picking me up.

587
00:24:00.239 --> 00:24:03.142
-Wha-what?
-Actually. his car is.

588
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.077
It drives itself.

589
00:24:05.177 --> 00:24:06.779
Self-driving?

590
00:24:06.879 --> 00:24:08.414
-Fancy!
-Yes.

591
00:24:08.515 --> 00:24:09.682
[laughs]

592
00:24:09.782 --> 00:24:12.985
Uh. excuse me? Boyfriend?
What did I miss?

593
00:24:13.085 --> 00:24:14.386
Is this what you wanted
to talk about?

594
00:24:14.487 --> 00:24:16.455
Oh my God. are you
bringing him to the wedding?

595
00:24:16.556 --> 00:24:17.657
-This is huge!
-No. no. no.

596
00:24:17.757 --> 00:24:19.191
It's way too late
to add a plus-one.

597
00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:22.328
No. it's not. I'm literally
texting our wedding planner.

598
00:24:22.428 --> 00:24:25.331
Which reminds me. would you mind
going to Santa Barbara?

599
00:24:25.431 --> 00:24:27.767
Logan is getting the rings
resized at some fancy place.

600
00:24:27.867 --> 00:24:30.169
and there is no one I trust
more than you.

601
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:31.671
Do you mind?

602
00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:34.774
-I don't mind. I'll do it.
-Thank you.

603
00:24:34.874 --> 00:24:36.543
Oh! I love you.

604
00:24:36.643 --> 00:24:38.511
-Mwah.
-Love you. Bye!

605
00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.482
[Zoey] And that's when
I knew I had to do both:

606
00:24:43.583 --> 00:24:45.284
the wedding and the finale.

607
00:24:45.952 --> 00:24:48.120
* Used to be a baby.
used to be a lady *

608
00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:51.223
* Thought you were
the perfect lover... *

609
00:24:51.991 --> 00:24:53.526
[Zoey] If I was going
to pull this off.

610
00:24:53.626 --> 00:24:54.994
I needed three things:

611
00:24:55.094 --> 00:24:57.697
A boyfriend. a car.
and a plan.

612
00:24:58.297 --> 00:24:59.932
The wedding is happening
at 4:00 p.m.

613
00:25:00.032 --> 00:25:01.868
at Logan's family estate
in Malibu.

614
00:25:01.968 --> 00:25:04.103
The live finale is happening
at 5:00 p.m.

615
00:25:04.203 --> 00:25:05.605
at the LOVE: Fully Charged
stage.

616
00:25:05.705 --> 00:25:07.674
just 2.3 miles up the road.

617
00:25:07.774 --> 00:25:09.075
By the time I'm needed on set.

618
00:25:09.175 --> 00:25:11.043
the wedding reception
will be in full swing.

619
00:25:11.143 --> 00:25:12.378
I'll slip away
to work the finale.

620
00:25:12.478 --> 00:25:14.446
and be back before
anyone notices I'm gone.

621
00:25:14.547 --> 00:25:15.782
It's foolproof.

622
00:25:15.882 --> 00:25:17.717
Next. I needed a car.

623
00:25:17.817 --> 00:25:19.018
A self-driving car.

624
00:25:19.118 --> 00:25:20.519
Securing the keys was easy.

625
00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:23.122
Kelley lets Archer take
the LUV-6 whenever he wants.

626
00:25:23.222 --> 00:25:24.891
and he was happy
to hand them over.

627
00:25:24.991 --> 00:25:26.559
[Archer]
Wait. you're taking the car?

628
00:25:26.659 --> 00:25:28.227
Zoey. get back here!

629
00:25:28.327 --> 00:25:30.196
What? Ugh!

630
00:25:30.930 --> 00:25:32.231
* Time to walk *

631
00:25:32.331 --> 00:25:33.666
Ugh. thank God.

632
00:25:33.766 --> 00:25:35.267
[slurps]

633
00:25:35.768 --> 00:25:38.370
The student
has become the master.

634
00:25:38.971 --> 00:25:41.007
[Zoey] Now. all I needed
was a date.

635
00:25:41.107 --> 00:25:43.475
But where I was supposed
to find a hotshot

636
00:25:43.576 --> 00:25:46.613
Australian ER surgeon
whose name was Hugo Hemsworth?

637
00:25:46.713 --> 00:25:48.514
Yo. what's up?
My name is Dragon.

638
00:25:48.615 --> 00:25:49.982
My real name is Vantarius.

639
00:25:50.082 --> 00:25:51.818
but I'm a really big
Game of Thrones fan.

640
00:25:51.918 --> 00:25:54.286
so I legally changed my name
when I turned 18.

641
00:25:54.386 --> 00:25:56.656
[grunts]

642
00:25:56.756 --> 00:25:58.991
Come on.
who can say no to this?

643
00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:02.595
My name's Spencer.
and I know what women want.

644
00:26:03.996 --> 00:26:05.698
[Zoey]
He probably didn't exist.

645
00:26:05.798 --> 00:26:08.067
What I needed was an actor.

646
00:26:08.167 --> 00:26:10.870
Hello. my name
is Todd E. Schupert.

647
00:26:10.970 --> 00:26:12.171
I'm 28 years old.

648
00:26:12.271 --> 00:26:13.539
I'm an actor from Burbank.
California.

649
00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:16.709
I can also do accents.
I can do Australian.

650
00:26:16.809 --> 00:26:19.511
[in Australian accent] I just
came out from Bondi Beach.

651
00:26:19.612 --> 00:26:21.213
G'day. how are ya?

652
00:26:21.313 --> 00:26:23.282
[Zoey]
And that's where you come in.

653
00:26:24.016 --> 00:26:25.051
Looking at your résumé.

654
00:26:25.151 --> 00:26:27.153
I can see that you have
years of training.

655
00:26:27.253 --> 00:26:29.321
dozens of student films
under your belt.

656
00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:30.757
BFA in Acting.

657
00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:34.694
Oh. and a minor
in Early Childhood Development.

658
00:26:34.794 --> 00:26:36.262
-Cool.
-No. no. no.

659
00:26:36.362 --> 00:26:39.498
I manny for family
on the side.

660
00:26:40.066 --> 00:26:42.201
Okay. I can quit if you need.

661
00:26:42.301 --> 00:26:45.604
No major TV shows or movies.
That's great.

662
00:26:46.138 --> 00:26:48.007
Okay. so. sorry.
what does this have to do

663
00:26:48.107 --> 00:26:50.977
with me getting on
LOVE: Fully Charged ?

664
00:26:51.077 --> 00:26:53.312
Todd. I'm not here
to talk to you

665
00:26:53.412 --> 00:26:55.247
about being on
LOVE: Fully Charged.

666
00:26:57.016 --> 00:26:59.285
I saw your submission tape.

667
00:26:59.385 --> 00:27:01.888
and I used my position of power
to get you here.

668
00:27:01.988 --> 00:27:04.556
That was wrong.
and I'm sorry about that.

669
00:27:05.457 --> 00:27:07.559
Okay. so why am I here?

670
00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:08.961
I need a favor.

671
00:27:09.495 --> 00:27:12.531
I need someone
to play my boyfriend

672
00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:14.566
at my best friend's wedding
next weekend.

673
00:27:15.134 --> 00:27:16.803
I need them to fully commit

674
00:27:16.903 --> 00:27:19.505
the way only a real actor can.

675
00:27:22.842 --> 00:27:25.912
Okay. So. like. method.

676
00:27:27.646 --> 00:27:29.548
Sure. Yeah.

677
00:27:32.719 --> 00:27:34.353
-[sighs]
-I...

678
00:27:34.453 --> 00:27:36.188
I don't know why I thought
this was a good idea.

679
00:27:36.288 --> 00:27:37.990
Forget I asked. I am sorry.

680
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:40.526
No. no. no.
Okay. if I do this.

681
00:27:40.626 --> 00:27:42.128
can you get me on the show?

682
00:27:42.228 --> 00:27:45.564
I mean. I can certainly try.

683
00:27:47.867 --> 00:27:49.168
That's good enough for me.

684
00:27:49.268 --> 00:27:50.703
* You and me
are through. though *

685
00:27:50.803 --> 00:27:52.071
* Watch me hit it solo *

686
00:27:52.171 --> 00:27:54.774
* I'm gonna do it a cappella.
yeah *

687
00:27:54.874 --> 00:27:56.408
[Zoey]
Is this completely insane?

688
00:27:56.508 --> 00:27:59.545
Which part. hiring a super-hot
actor to play your boyfriend

689
00:27:59.645 --> 00:28:01.513
at your best friend's wedding.
or agreeing to be at work

690
00:28:01.613 --> 00:28:03.682
the same weekend
as your best friend's wedding?

691
00:28:03.783 --> 00:28:05.084
The boyfriend part.

692
00:28:05.184 --> 00:28:06.753
Convincing your friends
you have a hot boyfriend

693
00:28:06.853 --> 00:28:09.722
is the least of your concerns
if he doesn't watch the road.

694
00:28:09.822 --> 00:28:10.990
Does he know what he's doing?

695
00:28:11.090 --> 00:28:12.524
[Zoey]
The car drives itself.

696
00:28:12.624 --> 00:28:15.094
and it performed very well
during the safety testing phase.

697
00:28:15.194 --> 00:28:17.429
It ran over six
crash dummies.

698
00:28:18.564 --> 00:28:20.332
Um. hello? Arch?

699
00:28:20.432 --> 00:28:23.402
I'm losing you
driving through the canyon.

700
00:28:23.502 --> 00:28:24.603
Bad service.

701

Okay. bye!

703
00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:31.110
It's the red button. Zoey.

Big red button. Center.
Yeah. right there. End--

Uh. what are you reading?

Oh. there are five steps to
creating the perfect character.

707

The who. the what. the when.
the where. and the why.

708
00:28:45.324 --> 00:28:47.726

You really took
some liberties there.

716
00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:06.345
I just can't crack the why.

717
00:29:06.445 --> 00:29:09.515
You know. my interpretation
is that he's being used

718
00:29:09.615 --> 00:29:12.251
as a tool to make
your ex-boyfriend jealous.

719
00:29:12.351 --> 00:29:13.685
-Is that right?
-Jealous?

720
00:29:13.786 --> 00:29:15.754
No. no. no. absolutely not.

721
00:29:16.155 --> 00:29:17.489
That would be immature.

722
00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:20.459
I just want to show him
and everyone

723
00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:23.963
that I am a very successful.
well-rounded adult

724

I don't know what to tell you.
Chauncy.

731
00:29:57.063 --> 00:29:58.530
he's just not shucking
fast enough.

732
00:29:58.630 --> 00:30:01.067
Get me another shucker.
No. no. no. get me two.

The people need oysters.

734
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:05.171
I got eyes on the bride.

735
00:30:08.174 --> 00:30:09.741
Hi. There you are.

736
00:30:10.209 --> 00:30:12.111
-I've been looking for you.
-I'm sorry. babe.

737
00:30:12.211 --> 00:30:13.512
I've been putting out fires
left and right.

738
00:30:13.612 --> 00:30:15.047
Isn't that what
the wedding planner's for?

739
00:30:15.147 --> 00:30:17.449
-Yeah. I fired her.
-You what?

740
00:30:17.549 --> 00:30:19.551
Look. she just-- She wasn't
executing the vision.

741
00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:20.953
I thought this weekend
was supposed to be

742
00:30:21.053 --> 00:30:22.088
relaxed and intimate.

743
00:30:22.188 --> 00:30:24.456
250 people is intimate. babe.

744
00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:26.225
Do you know how many
people I didn't invite?

745
00:30:26.792 --> 00:30:28.861
-It's just all a little much.
-A little much?

746
00:30:28.961 --> 00:30:30.262
We got two life-sized cakes

747
00:30:30.362 --> 00:30:31.898

to drop off.

748
00:30:31.998 --> 00:30:33.732
Yeah. Right there is fine.

751
00:30:37.736 --> 00:30:39.205
You work so hard.

752
00:30:39.305 --> 00:30:41.307
you deserve more
than a little much.

753
00:30:41.407 --> 00:30:43.375
You deserve the most much.

754
00:30:43.475 --> 00:30:44.944
I just want to give that to you.

755
00:30:45.044 --> 00:30:46.545

-No. no. no!
-These are cakes!

759
00:30:52.251 --> 00:30:54.086
Oh. wait. what?
This is a cake?

760
00:30:54.186 --> 00:30:55.487
-Yes.
-Damn!

761
00:30:55.587 --> 00:30:57.756
Could somebody get
these human cakes out of here.

762
00:30:57.856 --> 00:30:59.058

[sighs] This is truly an honor.
Honestly.

770
00:31:13.839 --> 00:31:15.274
Oh. speaking of the ceremony.

771
00:31:15.374 --> 00:31:17.309
I want to go over
what I have so far.

Here we go. Todd.

776
00:31:26.852 --> 00:31:28.520
[in Australian accent]
Mind calling me Hugo?

777
00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:30.422
It just helps me
stay in character.

778
00:31:30.522 --> 00:31:32.891
Now please. let me take
my moment before.

779
00:31:32.992 --> 00:31:35.394

through this thing called life."

What's up with that car?

783
00:31:44.403 --> 00:31:46.905
-Todd.
-I don't know anyone named Todd.

You almost hit us
with your car!

It's called making an entrance.
Logan.

796
00:32:20.606 --> 00:32:22.841
All right. I'll accept that.

797
00:32:23.275 --> 00:32:25.277
That's a pretty good entrance.
I mean. damn!

-What's up. Zoey?
-Michael. it's been too long.

00:32:28.214 --> 00:32:30.849
Yeah. no shit. we live in the
same city and we barely see you.

Of course I know
who you are.

about you.

I said two trays.

837
00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:49.628
So then I'm thinking
of closing with a joke.

838
00:33:49.728 --> 00:33:52.164

will be sobbing at that point.

The thing I love most
about Jordyn J.

944
00:38:00.879 --> 00:38:04.115
is probably her boobs.

945
00:38:04.215 --> 00:38:07.185
Oh. my God. The hair...

946
00:38:08.354 --> 00:38:11.022
looks so...

947
00:38:12.458 --> 00:38:13.392
good.

948
00:38:13.492 --> 00:38:15.461
So you knew about this

949
00:38:15.561 --> 00:38:16.728
and you let it happen?

950
00:38:16.828 --> 00:38:19.765
Because the hair?
That was it.

951
00:38:19.865 --> 00:38:21.333
That was all that he had.

952
00:38:21.433 --> 00:38:22.701
That's exactly why.

than just his hair.

Uh. he's a trendsetter.

956
00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:31.943
It's called strategy.

957
00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:33.178
Is it?

998
00:39:58.897 --> 00:40:00.599
Yeah. it was just a fling.

999
00:40:00.699 --> 00:40:02.100

Fix what?

1014

You happy?

1016

I can't have gray hair at 23.
I'm supposed to be hot.

1017
00:40:37.936 --> 00:40:40.105
You bleached your whole head
because of one gray hair?

1018
00:40:40.205 --> 00:40:42.173
Then it kind of started
falling out. so I had to cut it.

1019
00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:44.510
I tried to find you first.
but you weren't here.

If you need anything at all.

00:41:57.783 --> 00:41:59.484
Quinn?

1052
00:41:59.585 --> 00:42:01.386
[cell phone vibrates]

1053
00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.924
-Jordan B.. what do you want?
-[Jordan B.] Zoey. [cries]

1054
00:42:06.024 --> 00:42:08.827
Oh. no. no. no. no.
Don't cry. Don't cry.

1055
00:42:09.795 --> 00:42:11.162
It's gonna--
It's gonna be okay.

1056
00:42:11.697 --> 00:42:14.866
No! A neck tattoo will not fix
what you did to your hair.

1057
00:42:14.966 --> 00:42:16.935
[Quinn]
Who's getting a neck tattoo?

1058
00:42:18.303 --> 00:42:19.905
I-I have to go.

1059
00:42:20.772 --> 00:42:23.041
Quinn. I've been looking
all over for you.

1060
00:42:23.141 --> 00:42:25.376
What are you doing
in the bathtub?

1061
00:42:25.476 --> 00:42:26.978
I'm unclogging the drain.

1062
00:42:27.078 --> 00:42:29.347
Did you know clogged drains can
lead to corrosion and flooding?

1063
00:42:29.815 --> 00:42:30.916
Oh no.

1064
00:42:31.683 --> 00:42:33.852
Okay. what's wrong?

1065
00:42:35.186 --> 00:42:38.690
I never dreamed
of having a wedding.

1066
00:42:39.591 --> 00:42:41.827
But then I fell in love
with someone who did.

1067
00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:46.064
And I want to do this for him.
but it's all a lot.

1068
00:42:46.632 --> 00:42:48.299
Does Logan know that?

1069
00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:50.869
We've been together
over a decade. You'd think so.

1070
00:42:51.569 --> 00:42:52.771
But he's so totally absorbed.

1071
00:42:52.871 --> 00:42:54.239
it's like
he's a different person.

1072
00:42:54.339 --> 00:42:56.642
I know he's dreamed of having
an extravagant wedding.

1073
00:42:56.742 --> 00:42:58.409
and I'm trying
to be sensitive to that.

1074
00:42:58.509 --> 00:43:01.747
But I'm not a rational function.
My limits are not infinite.

1075
00:43:01.847 --> 00:43:03.581
If only humans
could have vertical asymptotes.

1076
00:43:03.682 --> 00:43:04.916
you know what I'm saying?

1077
00:43:06.251 --> 00:43:08.119
Not at all.

1078
00:43:08.654 --> 00:43:10.588
But I think I get
the gist of it.

1079
00:43:11.757 --> 00:43:13.424
So why don't we just
get out of here.

1080
00:43:13.524 --> 00:43:15.426
Leave my own party?

1081
00:43:15.526 --> 00:43:17.195
I don't think I'm allowed
to do that.

1082
00:43:17.295 --> 00:43:19.564
You're the bride.
You can do whatever you want.

1083
00:43:20.666 --> 00:43:22.033
Party's almost over.

1084
00:43:22.133 --> 00:43:23.201
Plus. there's a cake down there

1085
00:43:23.301 --> 00:43:25.036
that everyone thinks
is you anyway.

1086
00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:26.604
[laughs]

1087
00:43:27.405 --> 00:43:30.141
-Where would we even go?
-I have ideas.

1088
00:43:30.241 --> 00:43:32.410
-[muted club music playing]
-Seriously?

1089
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:33.745
A karaoke bar?

1090
00:43:33.845 --> 00:43:35.947
No. no. no. no. It's late.

1091
00:43:36.047 --> 00:43:37.749
The rehearsal's tomorrow.

1092
00:43:37.849 --> 00:43:40.185
-We gotta be rested.
-[Quinn] Hey!

1093
00:43:40.752 --> 00:43:41.920
Look at me.

1094
00:43:42.020 --> 00:43:43.388
I love you.

1095
00:43:44.389 --> 00:43:45.891
I love you too.

1096
00:43:45.991 --> 00:43:47.993
So stop thinking about
the wedding for one second

1097
00:43:48.093 --> 00:43:50.428
and have some fun with me.
okay?

1098
00:43:51.763 --> 00:43:52.630
[sighs]

1099
00:43:52.731 --> 00:43:53.799
Fine.

1100
00:43:53.899 --> 00:43:55.300
-Okay. All right.
-[all] Yeah!

1101
00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.568
But if Michael doesn't sing
Limp Bizkit. I'm leaving.

1102
00:43:57.669 --> 00:44:00.338
Cool. Everyone's drinks
are on Logan. Let's go inside.

1103
00:44:00.438 --> 00:44:02.607
-[all cheer]
-Let's go. Come on. babe.

1104
00:44:02.708 --> 00:44:04.475
-[Michael] That's it. Logan.
-[Stacey] Let's do this.

1105
00:44:04.910 --> 00:44:06.111
-You good?
-I'm good. You good?

1106
00:44:06.211 --> 00:44:07.578
-Yeah. Great.
-Good.

1107
00:44:07.679 --> 00:44:09.147

* You wanna mess

1127

* 'Cause we get it on
every day and every night *

1129
00:45:03.034 --> 00:45:04.635
Was he always that talented?

1130
00:45:04.736 --> 00:45:08.539
Yeah. but in school
it was mostly sad flute music.

1131
00:45:08.639 --> 00:45:09.941
Oh. yes!

1132
00:45:10.041 --> 00:45:12.778
So you all went
to high school together?

1133
00:45:12.878 --> 00:45:14.479
Yeah! PCA. baby!

1134
00:45:14.579 --> 00:45:16.481
So sad what happened.

1135
00:45:17.315 --> 00:45:20.852
We were the last class
to attend Pacific Coast Academy.

1136
00:45:20.952 --> 00:45:23.855
The school closed down in 2009

1137
00:45:23.955 --> 00:45:27.525
when multiple parents complained
about poor education standards.

1138
00:45:27.625 --> 00:45:30.295
leading the state to launch
a formal investigation.

1139
00:45:30.395 --> 00:45:33.198
only to discover the school
wasn't even accredited

1140
00:45:33.298 --> 00:45:35.633
and Dean Rivers was stealing
students' tuition

1141
00:45:35.733 --> 00:45:38.236
and blowing it
at Morongo Casino and Resort.

1142
00:45:38.336 --> 00:45:40.605
Yeah. it wasn't even
a real school.

1143
00:45:40.705 --> 00:45:43.174
The student loans were real! Ha!

1144
00:45:43.274 --> 00:45:45.710
[laughing]
I have so much debt!

1145

-Great job. buddy. Great job.

1149
00:45:57.422 --> 00:45:59.657
-Let's do it.
-[Logan] That was awesome!

1150
00:45:59.757 --> 00:46:01.692
[indistinct shouting]

1151
00:46:01.793 --> 00:46:04.830
I'm gonna hit the head.
Does anybody need anything?

1152
00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:07.232
Chase? Maybe a water?

1153
00:46:07.332 --> 00:46:08.900
Yes.

1154
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.601
All right. I'll be right back.

1155
00:46:11.169 --> 00:46:13.504
-Consent to a kiss?
-Granted.

1156
00:46:21.579 --> 00:46:24.916
All right. next up.
we have Hugo Hemsworth

1157
00:46:25.016 --> 00:46:27.618
and Chase Matthews

1158
00:46:27.718 --> 00:46:28.786
singing a duet.

1159
00:46:28.887 --> 00:46:30.455
No. I'm all set.

1160
00:46:31.489 --> 00:46:33.925
Babe. you love karaoke. Go!

1161
00:46:34.025 --> 00:46:35.726

Chase! Chase! Chase! Chase!

1163
00:46:40.932 --> 00:46:42.067
-Yes!

00:46:42.167 --> 00:46:43.568
[Stacey]
Yes. Chase!

1165
00:46:43.668 --> 00:46:44.569
Go. Chase. go!

1166
00:46:44.669 --> 00:46:45.871
Hope you're cool
with the high part.

1167
00:46:45.971 --> 00:46:46.938
Uh. what song are we even--

1168
00:46:47.038 --> 00:46:50.675
* Now I've had *

1169
00:46:50.775 --> 00:46:53.244
* The time of my life *

1170
00:46:53.344 --> 00:46:56.347
* No. I never felt
like this before *

1171
00:46:56.447 --> 00:46:58.216
Damn it. I love this song.

1172
00:46:58.316 --> 00:46:59.985
* Yes. I swear *

1173
00:47:00.085 --> 00:47:02.087
* It's the truth *

1174
00:47:02.187 --> 00:47:04.956
* And I owe it all to you *

1175
00:47:05.056 --> 00:47:08.459
* 'Cause I've had *

1176
00:47:08.559 --> 00:47:11.096
* The time of my life *

-Yo. they're both...
-Pretty good!

1179
00:47:17.402 --> 00:47:19.037
-Yeah.
-Let's go. Chase!

1180
00:47:19.137 --> 00:47:20.471
Not bad.

1181
00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:22.473
Bet you didn't know
I was a high tenor. did you?

1182
00:47:22.573 --> 00:47:24.442
* I've been waiting
for so long *

1183

* Now I finally
found someone *

00:47:27.178 --> 00:47:29.547
* To stand by me *

1185
00:47:31.116 --> 00:47:33.618
* We saw the writing
on the wall *

1186
00:47:33.718 --> 00:47:37.889
* As we felt
this magical fantasy *

1187
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:42.393
* Now with passion
in our eyes *

1188
00:47:42.493 --> 00:47:46.631
* There's no way
we could disguise it secretly *

1189
00:47:49.267 --> 00:47:50.902
* So we take
each others' hand *

1190
00:47:51.002 --> 00:47:56.474
* 'Cause we seem to understand
the urgency *

-Wasted?

this way before *

I can't dance like that.
I can't dance like that.

Oh. whoa. whoa.
Are you okay?

I am so sorry. dude.

What is this?

1211
00:49:02.607 --> 00:49:04.175
What? I thought we were
just having fun.

1212
00:49:04.275 --> 00:49:05.710
This is about Zoey. isn't it?

1213
00:49:05.810 --> 00:49:07.878
You're mad we dated so you're
trying to make me jealous.

1214

Well. that's not gonna work.
Mr. Sexy Doctor Man.

1215
00:49:10.348 --> 00:49:12.250
because I don't care
about Zoey anymore.

1216

-What's happening?
-Looks like they're fighting.

I'm over her!

00:49:22.393 --> 00:49:24.795
-Well. doesn't sound like it.
-What'd you say?

1221
00:49:24.895 --> 00:49:26.431
I just get the feeling

1222
00:49:26.531 --> 00:49:29.234
that maybe you're not
actually over her.

1223
00:49:32.137 --> 00:49:33.571
-[screams]
-[all gasp]

1224
00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:36.274
[all cheer]

1225
00:49:38.876 --> 00:49:40.445
[laughing]

1226
00:49:41.412 --> 00:49:43.281
You're getting a bit heavy.

1227
00:49:44.549 --> 00:49:46.484
-Ah!
-[all gasp]

1228
00:49:48.919 --> 00:49:50.888
-[Mark] What?
-Up! Up!

1229
00:49:50.988 --> 00:49:52.190
What is your problem?

1230
00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:55.293
Oh. boo-hoo! Time for rehearsal!

1231
00:49:55.393 --> 00:49:56.761
Out of bed!

1232
00:49:59.197 --> 00:50:01.032
Everybody outside in ten!

1233
00:50:01.132 --> 00:50:03.234
[Stacey]
What is the matter with you?

1234
00:50:03.334 --> 00:50:05.803
[both continue shouting
indistinctly]

1235
00:50:10.308 --> 00:50:12.610
Can't he leave me alone
for one minute?

1236
00:50:12.710 --> 00:50:14.312
I'm so sick
of babysitting this guy.

1237
00:50:14.412 --> 00:50:15.846
I cannot do this today.

1238
00:50:15.946 --> 00:50:16.981
[sighs]

1239
00:50:21.219 --> 00:50:23.054
-Todd.
-Hmm?

1240
00:50:23.154 --> 00:50:24.522
Aren't you a manny?

1241
00:50:25.323 --> 00:50:27.458
It's a side gig. but yeah.

1242
00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:30.761
-Hmm?
-No!

1243
00:50:31.196 --> 00:50:33.398
-[whimpers]
-[sighs]

1244
00:50:33.498 --> 00:50:36.467
No. I'm your fake boyfriend.

1245
00:50:37.868 --> 00:50:39.170
Fake hungover boyfriend.

1246
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:40.871
I'm not your babysitter.

1247
00:50:41.472 --> 00:50:42.440
Please. Please.

1248
00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.041
[Logan]
Meet me in the chapel in ten!

1249
00:50:44.142 --> 00:50:46.844
I have to go be with my friends.
I really need your help on this.

1250
00:50:46.944 --> 00:50:47.912
Please.

1251
00:50:48.012 --> 00:50:49.514
The villa is just
right up the street.

1252
00:50:49.614 --> 00:50:51.882
You can go up there.
distract him. have fun.

1253
00:50:51.982 --> 00:50:55.019
-Please. please. please?
-Wait. so I get to go to set?

1254
00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:56.854
Yes. Thank you.

1255
00:50:59.290 --> 00:51:01.626
Oh. my God. Finally.

1256
00:51:02.393 --> 00:51:04.395
[Logan]
Places! Okay.

1257
00:51:04.495 --> 00:51:06.331
So we're gonna start
with Michael

1258
00:51:06.431 --> 00:51:09.367
making an announcement
to ask all the guests

1259
00:51:09.467 --> 00:51:11.769
to silence their phones.

1260
00:51:12.337 --> 00:51:13.604
Cue Michael.

1261
00:51:14.772 --> 00:51:16.006
[wheezes]

1262
00:51:16.507 --> 00:51:17.908
[Michael gasps weakly]

1263
00:51:20.178 --> 00:51:21.579
Cue Michael.

1264
00:51:22.513 --> 00:51:24.182
[wheezing]
Silence your phone.

1265
00:51:24.282 --> 00:51:25.450
Bro. what is going on?

1266
00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:27.752
[Lyric]
"I think I lost my voice."

1267
00:51:28.453 --> 00:51:30.087
How do you know
what he's saying?

1268
00:51:30.188 --> 00:51:31.922
I'm really good at lip-reading.

1269
00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:33.224
From over there?

1270
00:51:33.324 --> 00:51:34.792
-Plus. I have 20/20 vision.
-[Logan] Great.

1271
00:51:34.892 --> 00:51:37.495
So my officiant
has lost his voice

1272
00:51:37.595 --> 00:51:39.497
the day before the wedding!

1273
00:51:40.431 --> 00:51:42.333
This is why we can't have fun.

1274
00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:44.835
[Lyric]
"Let me show you. Ready?"

1275
00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:47.538
Dearly beloved.
we are gathered here today

1276
00:51:47.638 --> 00:51:50.107
to celebrate this thing
called patriarchy.

1277
00:51:51.242 --> 00:51:52.577
Heard of it?

1278
00:51:52.943 --> 00:51:55.313
Which has been used
for centuries to oppress women

1279
00:51:55.413 --> 00:51:56.881
by buying and selling them.

1280
00:51:56.981 --> 00:51:59.417
It's also kept the majority of
wealth in the male minority.

1281
00:51:59.517 --> 00:52:00.851
[Logan]
Okay. thank you. Lyric.

1282
00:52:00.951 --> 00:52:03.788
Look. I'm sorry. buddy.
but I gotta replace you.

1283
00:52:03.888 --> 00:52:05.856
-[Lyric] "Son of a--"
-Fine.

1284
00:52:06.357 --> 00:52:07.925
-I'll do it.
-What?

1285
00:52:08.025 --> 00:52:11.562
I have the number one
murder podcast in the U.S.

1286
00:52:11.662 --> 00:52:13.398
People would literally kill

1287
00:52:13.498 --> 00:52:14.965
to have me officiate
their wedding.

1288
00:52:15.065 --> 00:52:16.601
Yeah. you make a fair point.

1289
00:52:16.701 --> 00:52:18.002
But who's gonna
walk me down the aisle?

1290
00:52:18.102 --> 00:52:21.239
-It's a straight line. babe.
-Michael. obviously.

1291
00:52:21.672 --> 00:52:23.308
[Lyric]
"Okay. sounds good."

1292
00:52:23.408 --> 00:52:24.742
[Logan]
Let's try this again.

1293
00:52:24.842 --> 00:52:28.513
Stacey will ask everyone
to silence their phones.

1294
00:52:28.613 --> 00:52:30.315
Get out of here. buddy.

1295
00:52:30.415 --> 00:52:32.683
-[clears throat]
-Cue Stacey.

1296
00:52:33.918 --> 00:52:37.722
[in deep. booming voice]
Silence your phones!

1297
00:52:38.856 --> 00:52:40.791
Just a little less creepy
next time. okay?

1298
00:52:40.891 --> 00:52:43.461
Yeah. okay.
Lyric's gonna sing us in.

1299
00:52:45.296 --> 00:52:46.964
Lyric!

1300
00:52:49.334 --> 00:52:50.535
[device chimes]

1301
00:52:50.635 --> 00:52:52.537
[vocalizes notes. stops]

1302
00:52:53.471 --> 00:52:55.440
[vocalizes notes. stops]

1303
00:52:55.906 --> 00:52:58.175
My AI gloves weren't programmed
to deal with that reverb.

1304
00:52:58.276 --> 00:52:59.610
Did you hear the echo?

1305
00:52:59.710 --> 00:53:01.646
-[vocalizing]
-[distorted audio]

1306
00:53:01.746 --> 00:53:03.514
All right. guys. get in places.

1307
00:53:03.614 --> 00:53:05.816
Michael. Mark.
Camille and Jared. come on.

1308
00:53:05.916 --> 00:53:07.485
-Tighten up.
-How's your nose?

1309
00:53:07.585 --> 00:53:08.886
How do you think?

1310
00:53:08.986 --> 00:53:11.356
Your boyfriend dropped me
on my face on purpose.

1311
00:53:11.456 --> 00:53:13.358
He did not do it on purpose.

1312
00:53:13.458 --> 00:53:16.193
Zoey. he's very strong.
His muscles are huge.

1313
00:53:16.294 --> 00:53:17.528
He definitely
could have held me.

1314
00:53:17.628 --> 00:53:20.097
Classic Chase.
Taking everything so personally.

1315
00:53:20.197 --> 00:53:21.832
He said he was sorry.

1316
00:53:23.401 --> 00:53:25.169
[Logan] All right.
cue Camille and Jared.

1317
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:27.738
Chase. I know it's awkward.
but for the sake of our friends.

1318
00:53:27.838 --> 00:53:29.907
can't we at least just try
to be friends?

1319
00:53:30.007 --> 00:53:31.108
[sighs]

1320
00:53:31.208 --> 00:53:32.743
I'm sorry. but after
everything that happened.

1321
00:53:32.843 --> 00:53:34.445
did you really think
we were gonna be able

1322
00:53:34.545 --> 00:53:36.080
to just link arms
and stroll off into the sunset?

1323
00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:39.216
All right. now Zoey and Chase
will link arms and stroll.

1324
00:53:39.317 --> 00:53:41.085
Okay. the timing of that
was unfair.

1325
00:53:41.185 --> 00:53:44.121
[Logan] They're linking.
They're strolling.

1326
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:47.758
You could look happy.

1327
00:53:48.659 --> 00:53:50.094
Okay. cue the bride.

1328
00:53:51.262 --> 00:53:53.831
[Chase] And. frankly. there is
no amount of philanthropy

1329
00:53:53.931 --> 00:53:55.533
that will ever make up
for those mistakes.

1330
00:53:55.633 --> 00:53:57.402
-[laughter]
-Lastly.

1331
00:53:57.502 --> 00:53:58.936
Quinn. you have come up

1332
00:53:59.036 --> 00:54:01.572
with so many wonderful
inventions over the years.

1333
00:54:01.672 --> 00:54:03.608
but I think
that your most impressive yet

1334
00:54:03.708 --> 00:54:05.876
is actually the reinvention

1335
00:54:05.976 --> 00:54:08.112
of this guy right here.
my best friend.

1336
00:54:08.212 --> 00:54:10.515
He's become an amazing man
because of you.

1337
00:54:10.615 --> 00:54:12.883
And so I think I speak
for all of us

1338
00:54:12.983 --> 00:54:15.520
when I say thank you very much.
Quinn.

1339
00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:17.788
-[all laugh]
-To Quinn and Logan. Everyone.

1340
00:54:17.888 --> 00:54:19.857
[all] To Quinn and Logan!

1341
00:54:19.957 --> 00:54:21.158
[glasses clink]

1342
00:54:23.461 --> 00:54:25.596
This is nice.
Stace. isn't this nice?

1343
00:54:25.696 --> 00:54:27.197
Everyone together.
celebrating?

1344
00:54:27.298 --> 00:54:30.968
Mm-hmm. Mark. tell me something.
You're my field producer. right?

1345
00:54:31.068 --> 00:54:32.269
And husband.

1346
00:54:32.370 --> 00:54:34.505
Then why aren't you
in the field?

1347
00:54:34.605 --> 00:54:36.607
I thought we'd take
the night off.

1348
00:54:36.707 --> 00:54:38.509
Can the women
who are being murdered

1349
00:54:38.609 --> 00:54:39.977
take the night off. Mark?

1350
00:54:40.077 --> 00:54:41.111
But...

1351
00:54:42.246 --> 00:54:43.280
couldn't he be here?

1352
00:54:44.114 --> 00:54:45.149
-What?
-I'm just saying.

1353
00:54:45.249 --> 00:54:47.385
technically couldn't
the Malibu Murderer

1354
00:54:47.752 --> 00:54:49.253
be at this wedding

1355
00:54:49.354 --> 00:54:50.755
in Malibu?

1356
00:54:52.256 --> 00:54:53.458
How dare you. Mark?

1357
00:54:53.558 --> 00:54:55.292
These are our closest
and dearest friends.

1358
00:54:55.393 --> 00:54:57.762
-You're so right.
-Why would there be a murderer

1359
00:54:57.862 --> 00:54:59.597
-at this wedding?
-Just forget I said it.

1360
00:54:59.697 --> 00:55:00.998
Enjoy your fish.

1361
00:55:04.669 --> 00:55:06.303
-Where's Hugo?
-Oh.

1362
00:55:06.404 --> 00:55:07.705
Um. uh...

1363
00:55:08.673 --> 00:55:10.207
he got called in
for an emergency.

1364
00:55:10.307 --> 00:55:12.377
If only there were more
people like him in the world.

1365
00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:15.813
Hey. Zoe. your turn.
Like yesterday.

1366
00:55:15.913 --> 00:55:17.648
Oh. right. Yeah. okay.

1367
00:55:18.248 --> 00:55:19.350
[glass clinking]

1368
00:55:19.450 --> 00:55:23.253
I would like to make a toast.

1369
00:55:24.088 --> 00:55:28.626
I've known Quinn and Logan
for more than half my life.

1370
00:55:29.193 --> 00:55:31.962
During that time.
I've watched Quinn grow.

1371
00:55:32.062 --> 00:55:36.501
evolve. and accomplish
almost all of her dreams.

1372
00:55:37.034 --> 00:55:39.103
And I've watched Logan
watch her do that.

1373
00:55:39.203 --> 00:55:40.605
[all laugh]

1374
00:55:41.005 --> 00:55:45.109
Everyone says that high school
love doesn't last.

1375
00:55:45.209 --> 00:55:46.977
and they're right.

1376
00:55:47.077 --> 00:55:49.847
Most of the time. it doesn't.

1377
00:55:50.581 --> 00:55:52.717
Against all odds.

1378
00:55:52.817 --> 00:55:55.252
Quinn and Logan
have proved them wrong.

1379
00:55:57.388 --> 00:55:59.289
Uh... um...

1380
00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:03.093
uh. that's why it's so real

1381
00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:05.463
and inspiring.

1382
00:56:05.563 --> 00:56:07.798
Just really makes me.

1383
00:56:07.898 --> 00:56:11.436
you know. just dance a little
and. um...

1384
00:56:12.102 --> 00:56:14.672
[bangs on table]
...just really gets me

1385
00:56:14.772 --> 00:56:18.208
so excited. I just want
to sing and drink a lot.

1386
00:56:18.308 --> 00:56:19.844
-[all cheer]
-Yeah!

1387
00:56:19.944 --> 00:56:22.012
To Quinn and Logan!

1388
00:56:22.112 --> 00:56:24.415
-[excited chatter]
-[glasses clink]

1389
00:56:25.483 --> 00:56:26.751
[all gasp]

1390
00:56:26.851 --> 00:56:29.654
I'm such a klutz.
I'm gonna have to go change.

1391
00:56:29.754 --> 00:56:31.188
You missed your mouth
by a lot.

1392
00:56:31.288 --> 00:56:33.190
I know. I'm sorry.
I'll be right back. okay?

1393
00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:37.628
What is going on?

1394
00:56:37.728 --> 00:56:39.764
Why is he here?
And what is on his face?

1395
00:56:39.864 --> 00:56:42.767
I'm an ice tiger. Grr!

1396
00:56:43.468 --> 00:56:44.735
Todd. what happened?

1397
00:56:44.835 --> 00:56:46.504
[in normal voice]
You told me to babysit.

1398
00:56:46.604 --> 00:56:47.938
So I took him to the pier.

1399
00:56:48.038 --> 00:56:50.441
He wanted to ride
the kiddy coaster. right?

1400
00:56:50.541 --> 00:56:53.410
But he's too big. so he hit
his head on the support beam.

1401
00:56:55.379 --> 00:56:58.148
Now he can't remember
the last six months of his life.

Did I just hear a lion?

1406
00:57:06.891 --> 00:57:10.060
No. My dad made me get rid
of all my exotic pets.

1407

[Todd]
It's not that big of a deal.

1408
00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:13.698
Right? It's okay.

1409
00:57:13.798 --> 00:57:16.901
I mean. wasn't Jordan B.

1411
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:21.872
You're right. maybe nobody
will even notice.

1412
00:57:21.972 --> 00:57:24.308
I mean. I'm gonna be telling him
exactly what to say.

1413
00:57:24.742 --> 00:57:26.644
Okay. I need to get back
down there.

1414
00:57:26.744 --> 00:57:28.178
So you're gonna sneak him
into the villa.

1415
00:57:28.278 --> 00:57:29.747
put him to sleep.
he'll sleep this off.

the car is the least
of your worries.

1428
00:58:17.161 --> 00:58:20.865
Have you seen Jordan B. today?
Is he acting a little.

Just as dumb as usual. Why?

No reason! Look. I'm on my way
with the car.

1436
00:58:38.448 --> 00:58:41.351
I just have to make a little
pit stop in Santa Barbara.

That is not on the way.

where we're going?

that you don't want to hear
what I have to say.

this weekend.

So. Quinn and Logan.
what's your story?

1561
01:03:54.932 --> 01:03:57.101
-Again. we're actually not...
-We don't want to...

1562
01:03:57.201 --> 01:04:00.304
Oh. come on. don't be
those people. so boring.

1563
01:04:00.404 --> 01:04:02.306
Don't even think
about being those people.

1564
01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:05.575
You're not gonna get these rings
until you spill the tea.

1565
01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:07.177
Now. where did you meet?

1566
01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.047
Well. we met in middle school.

1567
01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:12.516
Oh. young love. I love.
Then what?

1568
01:04:12.616 --> 01:04:15.819
He saw me and ran his bike
into a flagpole.

1569
01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:17.321
-No. A flagpole?
-I'm dead.

1570
01:04:17.421 --> 01:04:19.656
-Then we became best friends.
-Study buddies.

1571
01:04:19.756 --> 01:04:21.558
But everybody knew
I had a thing for her.

1572
01:04:21.658 --> 01:04:23.293
And no one knew
I had a thing for him.

1573
01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:24.828
-They knew.
-They did not.

1574
01:04:24.929 --> 01:04:26.964
But every time I tried
to take it to the next level.

1575
01:04:27.064 --> 01:04:29.366
something always got in the way.

1576
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.768
-Other boyfriends.
-[all gasp]

1577
01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:34.071
-Other girlfriends.
-Yikes. We don't like that.

1578
01:04:34.171 --> 01:04:35.739
-Distance.
-Mm-hmm.

1579
01:04:35.839 --> 01:04:37.274
-Mistakes.
-Ugh.

1580
01:04:37.374 --> 01:04:39.009
But anyway. here we are
getting married now.

1581
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:40.677
It's great.
so fast-forward to now.

1582
01:04:40.777 --> 01:04:41.578
We'd love our rings.

1583
01:04:41.678 --> 01:04:43.147
[chanting]
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

1584
01:04:43.247 --> 01:04:45.849
[all]
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

1585
01:04:45.950 --> 01:04:48.552
-Actually. we're just gonna...
-Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

1586
01:04:48.652 --> 01:04:50.820
-We're just gonna...
-Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

1587
01:04:50.921 --> 01:04:55.392
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

1588
01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:57.661
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

1589
01:04:57.761 --> 01:04:59.829
-[all cheer]
-[camera shutters click]

1590
01:05:00.931 --> 01:05:02.599
Guys. seriously?

1591
01:05:02.699 --> 01:05:04.969
-We're actually gonna head.
-We should leave. right?

1592
01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:06.736
This is a lot.
And the champagne was...

1593
01:05:06.836 --> 01:05:09.706
* I'm just waiting
for your love *

1594
01:05:09.806 --> 01:05:12.209
* You know you are
the only one *

1595
01:05:12.309 --> 01:05:13.643
* That I think of *

1596
01:05:13.743 --> 01:05:17.147
* And all I want to do
is fuel the fire *

1597
01:05:17.247 --> 01:05:18.648
[all]
Oh.

1598
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:21.618
-Seriously. these suck.
-Every single one.

1599
01:05:21.718 --> 01:05:23.020
Blurry.

1600
01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:26.256
No. actually.
Zoey's the big spoon

1601
01:05:26.356 --> 01:05:27.757
and I'm the little spoon.

1602
01:05:27.857 --> 01:05:29.026
We're cute like that.

1603
01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:30.160
[all laugh]

1604
01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:31.928
Hugo. you are hilarious.

1605
01:05:32.029 --> 01:05:33.297
Where did you grow up again?

1606
01:05:33.397 --> 01:05:34.564
[in normal voice]
Burbank.

1607
01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:36.266
[in Australian accent]
Uh... Brisbane.

1608
01:05:38.602 --> 01:05:39.403
[laughs]

1609
01:05:39.503 --> 01:05:40.904
Australia. Brisbane.

1610
01:05:43.107 --> 01:05:45.675
[Lyric] Sometimes I use an
Australian accent when I go out.

1611
01:05:45.775 --> 01:05:47.611
[in bad Australian accent]
You wouldn't believe

1612
01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:51.748
how many men. women.
and nonbinary people I get

1613
01:05:51.848 --> 01:05:53.217
when I use this voice.

1614
01:05:53.317 --> 01:05:55.585
Hey. Hugo. could you text
Zoey for me?

1615
01:05:55.685 --> 01:05:57.821
I've tried a bunch of times.
but she hasn't responded.

1616
01:05:57.921 --> 01:05:59.323
Yeah. can do.

1617
01:05:59.423 --> 01:06:01.725
I'll get us a bottle
while I'm out.

1618
01:06:03.227 --> 01:06:04.561
[sighs]

1619
01:06:06.396 --> 01:06:07.564
All right. see you soon.

1620
01:06:07.664 --> 01:06:10.700
[in bad accent]
Ugh. Aussies are the best.

1621
01:06:12.036 --> 01:06:14.471
[computerized voice]
Hey. Logan. here's an idea.

1622
01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:16.306
I can still officiate
the wedding

1623
01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:17.907
using text to voice.

1624
01:06:18.008 --> 01:06:19.809
What? No. dude.
Absolutely not.

1625
01:06:19.909 --> 01:06:22.146
Look. I can't find Chase
anywhere. Where is he?

1626
01:06:22.246 --> 01:06:23.580
[wheezing]

1627
01:06:24.448 --> 01:06:26.050
Dude. I can't hear
a single thing you're saying.

1628
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:27.117
Where is he?

1629
01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:28.718
-I'll text him.
-I'll text him.

1630
01:06:28.818 --> 01:06:29.886
Thank you. Jared.

1631
01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:34.324
[computerized voice]
Jared. you suck.

1632
01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:36.093
Really. Michael?

1633
01:06:36.193 --> 01:06:38.162
[upbeat music playing]

1634
01:06:38.262 --> 01:06:39.596
[Chase and Zoey laughing]

1635
01:06:39.696 --> 01:06:41.265
[Chase] Is that what happens
when you get engaged?

1636
01:06:41.365 --> 01:06:42.866
Free champagne
everywhere you go?

1637
01:06:42.966 --> 01:06:44.401
[Zoey] No. that's what happens
when you drop

1638
01:06:44.501 --> 01:06:46.670
-six figures on a ring.
-[laughs]

1639
01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:49.039
So. um. you think you and Hugo
will get engaged?

1640
01:06:49.139 --> 01:06:50.740
[laughing] No.

1641
01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.909
I'm-I'm-- I mean. no.

1642
01:06:53.910 --> 01:06:55.845
Not really thinking
about marriage.

1643
01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.714
But what about you?

1644
01:06:57.814 --> 01:06:59.849
Danielle? No.
I mean. she's great.

1645
01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:01.785
Um. for now.

1646
01:07:01.885 --> 01:07:04.321
Uh. you know.
the timing just felt right.

1647
01:07:04.754 --> 01:07:06.856
Timing. Something we never had.

1648
01:07:11.228 --> 01:07:13.630
[somber music playing]

1649
01:07:14.598 --> 01:07:16.900
I'm so sorry about Hawaii.

1650
01:07:17.534 --> 01:07:19.369
I tried to call.
I sent messages.

1651
01:07:19.469 --> 01:07:21.538
And I completely understand
why you didn't respond.

1652
01:07:21.638 --> 01:07:24.141
but I wanted the chance
to explain why I--

1653
01:07:24.241 --> 01:07:27.043
Left me alone on a literal
island and waited weeks to call?

1654
01:07:27.144 --> 01:07:28.778
Yeah. why did you do that?

1655
01:07:31.215 --> 01:07:35.319
I guess I was so used to it
not working out between us

1656
01:07:35.419 --> 01:07:38.555
that I was scared
of what would happen

1657
01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:42.025
if it actually did.
So I just bailed.

1658
01:07:43.327 --> 01:07:46.096
I really. really wish I hadn't.

1659
01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:50.167
I mean. I've tried to move on.
I've tried to forget.

1660
01:07:50.267 --> 01:07:51.868
I threw myself into work.

1661
01:07:51.968 --> 01:07:54.371
Distanced myself
from all of our friends.

1662
01:07:54.471 --> 01:07:56.706
I even downloaded
every dating app on Earth.

1663
01:07:56.806 --> 01:07:59.676
But no matter what I did.
it always came back to you.

1664
01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:05.382
I know that sounds
so ridiculous. but it's why...

[Chase]
Why is the car stopping?

1668
01:08:38.415 --> 01:08:40.884
[male voice]
Zero percent charge.

1669
01:08:42.386 --> 01:08:44.720
Oh. my gosh.
You have to charge this car.

1670
01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:46.656
[Chase]
Yeah. that's kind of a thing.

[dramatic orchestral music

Thank you.

Is that what you're wearing?

1675
01:09:00.837 --> 01:09:02.305
Yeah. why?

1676
01:09:02.406 --> 01:09:03.740
No reason.

1677
01:09:05.408 --> 01:09:06.776
-Anything yet from Zoey?
-No.

1678
01:09:06.876 --> 01:09:08.778
Calls are going
straight to voicemail.

1679
01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:09.946
Why is...

1680
01:09:10.046 --> 01:09:11.648
...nothing going through?

1681
01:09:13.350 --> 01:09:16.085
[Chase] Yeah. I think I had
better over here. actually.

1682
01:09:16.185 --> 01:09:18.721
[Zoey] What am I gonna do?
How could this be the one spot

1683
01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:20.557
that there's absolutely
no service?

I think we can make it.
but we have to go.

1687
01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:27.197
We have to walk now.

-Come on.

[Chase] Yeah. it'll be good.
Here we go.

1690

Have you heard from Chase
this morning?

1691
01:09:39.943 --> 01:09:41.245
Nobody can get
a hold of him.

1692
01:09:41.345 --> 01:09:43.011
No. I haven't.

1693
01:09:43.747 --> 01:09:45.482
Wow. you look so good.

1694
01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:47.451
Thanks. So do you.

-No. I haven't.

to be their first look?

-They're weird like that.
-[Logan] Wait.

1698

So the maid of honor and
the best man are both missing?

1699
01:09:57.227 --> 01:09:58.595
I can't believe this.

1700
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:03.767
[Zoey. breathlessly]
How much farther?

1701
01:10:04.268 --> 01:10:05.969
[Chase] Oh. Here.

Here. you wear mine.

Oh. that's so much better.

1705
01:10:12.576 --> 01:10:13.710
Yeah. this is...

-This is not better.
-Okay.

So normally I could not
afford Montecito.

1715
01:11:09.132 --> 01:11:13.169
but I can afford Montecito
if the house has had a murder.

1716
01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.705
-which this one has.
-Uh-huh.

01:11:43.567 --> 01:11:46.336
Does anyone have eyes
on the car?

01:11:46.436 --> 01:11:48.838
[dramatic orchestral music
playing]

1731
01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:53.343
[Chase] Oh. God.

1732
01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:55.412
Come on. we gotta go.
We gotta go.

1733
01:11:55.512 --> 01:11:56.813
[Zoey sighs] Okay.

1734
01:11:57.213 --> 01:11:58.848
[cell phone vibrating]

1735
01:12:00.517 --> 01:12:01.985
[phone line ringing]

1736
01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:07.591
-Hello?
-Oh. my God!

1737
01:12:07.691 --> 01:12:09.559
I thought you were dead!
I hoped you were dead!

1738
01:12:09.659 --> 01:12:10.760
I've called you
like a thousand times.

1739
01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:13.229
-Where the hell are you?
-I know. I know.

1740
01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:16.099
So I didn't exactly realize that
the car needed to be charged.

1741
01:12:16.199 --> 01:12:17.934
So it's dead on the side
of the PCH.

1742
01:12:18.034 --> 01:12:19.769
Oh. my God!

1743
01:12:20.404 --> 01:12:21.738
But it's okay.

1744
01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:23.673
The car doesn't even
need to be there...

1745
01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:27.777
because Jordan B. is going
to listen to what I say.

1746
01:12:27.877 --> 01:12:30.146
How are you gonna tell him what
to say if you're not here?

1747
01:12:30.246 --> 01:12:32.416
Archer. you're gonna
have to trust me on this one.

1748
01:12:32.516 --> 01:12:34.384
Well. I actually don't.

1749
01:12:34.484 --> 01:12:36.119
-[sighs]
-Um...

1750
01:12:36.219 --> 01:12:37.954
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.
but it sounds like

1751
01:12:38.054 --> 01:12:40.323
you've gotten yourself into
quite a complicated situation.

1752
01:12:40.424 --> 01:12:42.125
You have no idea.

1753
01:12:42.225 --> 01:12:43.627

Okay. we have waited
as long as we can. all right?

1757
01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:08.117
These guests are gonna leave

1758
01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.986
if we have to listen to Lyric
sing anymore.

1759
01:13:10.554 --> 01:13:11.555
[Zoey] Wait.

1760
01:13:11.655 --> 01:13:13.557
We're here.
And we have the rings.

1761
01:13:13.657 --> 01:13:15.258
Quinn. I'm so sorry.
I can explain.

1762
01:13:15.358 --> 01:13:18.695
No. No explanations. all right?
We are late enough as it is.

1763
01:13:18.795 --> 01:13:21.264
Places. Go. Go.

1764
01:13:25.201 --> 01:13:26.235

You were right under my nose.

How did I not see it sooner?

1877
01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:40.516
First. you came to the welcome
reception in dirty scrubs.

1878
01:18:40.616 --> 01:18:44.353
and no self-respecting ER doctor
would ever leave the hospital

1879
01:18:44.453 --> 01:18:45.855
in dirty scrubs.

1880
01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:48.724
Two. you said you were
from Burbank.

1881
01:18:48.825 --> 01:18:50.693
which is not in Australia.

1882
01:18:50.794 --> 01:18:52.295
And also...

1883
01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:55.464
you have massive hands.

1884
01:18:56.032 --> 01:18:57.033
Hey. look...

1885
01:18:57.133 --> 01:19:01.170
Everyone. this man
is not the charming.

cousin that we all thought.

-Wait. wait? Murderer?

1890
01:19:14.984 --> 01:19:16.652
No. no. no. no. I...

1891
01:19:18.021 --> 01:19:19.688
[in normal voice]
I'm not a murderer.

1892
01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:24.527
I'm an actor.

1894
01:19:26.662 --> 01:19:29.698
Jordan B.. what do you love most
about Jordyn J.?

1895
01:19:29.799 --> 01:19:32.268
-What's going on?
-Nothing. absolutely nothing.

1896
01:19:32.368 --> 01:19:34.570
Nothing. absolutely nothing.

[audience gasps]

1898
01:19:36.439 --> 01:19:39.375
[Archer] Jordan B..
we're all a little confused.

1899
01:19:39.475 --> 01:19:41.845
What is it that you really want?

1900
01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:46.149
If it's absolutely nothing.
then why were you late?

1901
01:19:46.249 --> 01:19:47.951
It was the car! The car!

1902
01:19:48.051 --> 01:19:49.785
[gasps]

Yes. Sorry. Of course.

1909

Am I hearing you correctly?

You're choosing the car?

I'm working.

1923
01:20:35.231 --> 01:20:36.565
I'm working during your wedding.

1924
01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:40.269
I got an opportunity.
and I tried to do both.

1925
01:20:40.369 --> 01:20:42.505
If you had to work.
why didn't you just tell me?

1926
01:20:43.239 --> 01:20:46.175
Because this is so important.
and you were so excited.

1927
01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:49.178
So I lied. To myself. to you.

1928
01:20:49.278 --> 01:20:50.746
To everyone.

1929
01:20:52.648 --> 01:20:55.784
What about him?
What is Stacey talking about?

1930
01:20:55.885 --> 01:20:57.386
Hugo is not a murderer.

1931
01:20:57.486 --> 01:21:00.856
I'm not sure how she came
to that conclusion.

1932
01:21:02.825 --> 01:21:04.193
His name is Todd.

1933
01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:07.663
and I hired him to be
my boyfriend for the weekend.

1934
01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:10.633
I knew something
was going on with you.

1935
01:21:11.634 --> 01:21:14.237
You've been distant
and distracted.

1936
01:21:14.837 --> 01:21:17.740
and you completely abandoned me
when I needed you the most.

1937
01:21:18.407 --> 01:21:21.110
To do what? Hang out with Chase?

1938
01:21:21.744 --> 01:21:23.646
Zoey. you should be
ashamed of yourself.

1939

Logan. don't even start.

1940
01:21:26.015 --> 01:21:28.384
You care more about
making this wedding a spectacle

1941
01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:30.353
than about making it meaningful.

1942
01:21:30.453 --> 01:21:34.257
You completely ignored me
every step of the way.

1943

None of this is what I wanted.

this weekend.

two weeks ago.

She agreed to still
come with me to the wedding

1990

to show up alone.

hire an actor.

I know we thought
high school was hard.

to go back to PCA.

Sushi Rox closed
when the school did.

started a food truck.

to cater.

excited about the band.

they're unavailable today.

to play the music?

Maybe this all happened
for a reason.

Maybe we just want
different things.

01:37:29.111 --> 01:37:31.313
Somebody help me. My God.

2252
01:37:31.413 --> 01:37:33.481
With a 300-mile driving radius--

2253
01:37:33.581 --> 01:37:35.483
Uh-huh. what's the line?
[laughs]

2254
01:37:35.583 --> 01:37:37.986
I'm sorry to this camera
that has to go back and forth.

2255
01:37:38.086 --> 01:37:39.154
Loving you.

2256
01:37:39.254 --> 01:37:42.090

01:37:44.659 --> 01:37:46.694
[woman]
Could you play that back?

2260
01:37:46.794 --> 01:37:48.130
[laughs]

2261
01:37:48.230 --> 01:37:49.264
* Yeah *

2262
01:37:50.532 --> 01:37:53.301
Are you guys still filming me?
Can I ask an honest question?

2263
01:37:53.401 --> 01:37:55.537
Can you tell that these are
ladies' leggings?

2264
01:37:56.604 --> 01:37:58.873
I don't think you can tell.
Right?

2265
01:38:01.143 --> 01:38:03.045
* Yeah. yeah *

2266
01:38:03.145 --> 01:38:04.279
I'm good.

2267
01:38:04.379 --> 01:38:06.081
-[man] Cut.

2268
01:38:06.181 --> 01:38:07.749
-Are you okay?
-[Erin] No. I'm not.

2269
01:38:09.051 --> 01:38:10.252
And that's that.

2270
01:38:10.352 --> 01:38:11.886
* Inside your head *

2271
01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:15.623
* Just get out
with me instead *

2272
01:38:16.258 --> 01:38:18.927

2276
01:38:28.703 --> 01:38:31.439

2277
01:38:32.374 --> 01:38:34.776

* Let's just get away. yeah *

2282
01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:47.222
* We can make them see *

2283
01:38:47.689 --> 01:38:51.093
* All of the things
that we can be *

2284
01:38:51.193 --> 01:38:55.397

and follow me *

2285

2289
01:39:09.611 --> 01:39:13.048
* But you don't need
shooting stars *

2290
01:39:13.148 --> 01:39:16.384
* The magic's all in you *

2291
01:39:16.484 --> 01:39:18.753
