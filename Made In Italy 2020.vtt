Before this turns
into a bidding war.

33
00:01:46.648 --> 00:01:47.774
Okay Jack.

34
00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.317
How did you get her?

35
00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:50.443
Dean hasn't exhibited for years.

36
00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:52.570
What did you say?

37
00:01:52.612 --> 00:01:54.656
Trade secrets.
Marie. trade secrets.

38
00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:57.158
Well perhaps you could work
your magic on your father.

39
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.868
I'd love to know
what he's doing.

40
00:02:00.161 --> 00:02:01.663
Wouldn't we all?

41
00:02:06.626 --> 00:02:07.460
Ruth.

42
00:02:08.878 --> 00:02:11.464
I thought we agreed you
weren't coming tonight.

43
00:02:11.506 --> 00:02:14.509
I hate to tell you what a
great job you're doing here.

44
00:02:16.803 --> 00:02:18.263
Yeah I think we've
done pretty well.

45
00:02:18.304 --> 00:02:19.848
You should enjoy it.

46
00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:21.599
Really enjoy it.

47
00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:22.851
Because it's over.

48
00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:25.353
Sorry. what?

49
00:02:27.397 --> 00:02:29.024
My family is selling
the gallery. Jack.

50
00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:34.154
What did you think. Jack?

51
00:02:34.195 --> 00:02:36.448
You'll just carry on managing
the gallery indefinitely?

52
00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:38.783
We are divorced.

53
00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:41.036
At least we will be when
you sign the papers.

54
00:02:41.077 --> 00:02:44.289
This gallery is my home. Ruth.

55
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.707
I've put everything into it.

56
00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.334
Everything except money.

57
00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:51.421
Okay.

58
00:02:53.506 --> 00:02:54.549
I'll buy the gallery.

59
00:02:54.591 --> 00:02:57.177
(chuckling) Did you
win the lottery?

60
00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:01.431
I could maybe sell
the old Italian house

61
00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:03.600
with my dad.

62
00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:06.019
The deserted barn no
one's allowed to mention.

63
00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:07.020
let alone visit?

64
00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:10.523
Your dad's a selfish prick

65
00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:12.442
who's never even
been to your gallery.

66
00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.529
He'll never sell that
place and you know it.

67
00:03:19.074 --> 00:03:20.700
Stick to the lottery plan. Jack.

68
00:03:22.243 --> 00:03:23.370

Dad. me again.

00:03:38.385 --> 00:03:39.844
I'm on my way.
I'll be 20 minutes.

I thought it was tomorrow.

92
00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:53.835
You could at least have called

93
00:04:53.877 --> 00:04:54.753
or left a message.

94
00:04:54.794 --> 00:04:56.629
Hey Robbie.

00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:58.131
Have you seen my jacket?

96
00:04:58.173 --> 00:04:59.007
Oh.

97
00:05:00.008 --> 00:05:01.426
Hi.

98
00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:04.095
Yeah. Jessica. this is
my son. actually. Jack.

99
00:05:04.137 --> 00:05:06.514
Jack. this is Jessica.

100
00:05:06.556 --> 00:05:07.390
Hi. Jessica.

101
00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:09.726
Fuck you.

102
00:05:11.644 --> 00:05:12.479
Jessica.

103
00:05:14.064 --> 00:05:15.523
Jessica.

104
00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:16.649
Jennifer?

105
00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:18.151
Jennifer. Jennifer. shit.

106
00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:20.195
Okay. tea.

107
00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:21.029
I'll make the tea.

108
00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:22.238
You go pack.

109
00:05:23.198 --> 00:05:25.825
(cars honking)

110
00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:42.884
Are you gonna read
the whole way there?

111
00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:46.012
The Dover road is famously
the most boring drive

112
00:05:46.054 --> 00:05:47.639
in the British Isles.

113
00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:48.515
Ask anyone.

114
00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:52.686
So you're not gonna
talk to me then.

115
00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:55.814
What would you
like to talk about?

116
00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:59.025
I don't know. the
usual father-son stuff?

117
00:06:03.863 --> 00:06:06.199
What are your views
on Hentai manga?

118
00:06:06.241 --> 00:06:08.535
Do you see it as
art or pornography?

119
00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.164
I meant like how's work.

120
00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:16.042
Oh. I see. an off
the peg conversation.

121
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.753
Ah. how's work?

122
00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.172
Forget it. read your book.

123
00:06:21.214 --> 00:06:23.425
No. no. this is starting
to get really good.

124
00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:25.260
Are you eating well?

125
00:06:27.053 --> 00:06:30.223
Did you see the game last night?

126
00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:31.349
What game?

127
00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.059
You know. the one with the ball.

128
00:06:37.147 --> 00:06:37.981
How's Ruth?

129
00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:40.900
She's great.

130
00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:42.819
Sends you her love.

131
00:06:45.238 --> 00:06:46.072
Terrific.

132
00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.911
(light music)

133
00:07:04.591 --> 00:07:05.717
Okay. what's bugging you?

134
00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:06.593
Spit it out.

135
00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:08.887
I'm worried the house
won't be the way

136
00:07:08.928 --> 00:07:09.929
you remember it.

137
00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:12.515
Why not?

138
00:07:14.434 --> 00:07:16.644
You haven't been back
since you were seven.

139
00:07:17.687 --> 00:07:19.481
I mean the walls. for example.

140
00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:23.276
The walls haven't been
painted in decades.

141
00:07:23.318 --> 00:07:24.235
That's an easy fix.

142
00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:27.572
The grounds might need tending.

143
00:07:27.614 --> 00:07:29.949
Look. I'm not expecting Xanadu.

144
00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:32.952
We just cheer the place
up a bit and get it sold.

145
00:07:32.994 --> 00:07:33.828
Why the rush?

146
00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.831
I don't hear from
you for months.

147
00:07:36.873 --> 00:07:39.084
and then this sudden need
to sell the Tuscan house

148
00:07:39.125 --> 00:07:40.460
by last Tuesday.

149
00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:44.464
The house that's been
basically empty for 20 years?

150
00:07:45.632 --> 00:07:46.925
Look on the bright side.

151
00:07:46.966 --> 00:07:49.010
You'll be home on
Saturday with a big check

152
00:07:49.052 --> 00:07:50.762
and you can blow
your half picking up

153
00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.430
stray women in bars.

154
00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.516
Don't make assumptions
about my current lifestyle

155
00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:55.475
based on Jessica.

156
00:07:55.517 --> 00:07:56.309
Jennifer.

157
00:07:56.351 --> 00:07:57.185
Jennifer. fuck.

158
00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.104
Jack.

159
00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.022
My point is we
should take a moment.

160
00:08:01.064 --> 00:08:02.524
Look.

161
00:08:02.565 --> 00:08:05.694
Ruth and I decided to buy
the gallery from her parents.

162
00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:08.697
So yeah. that's why I
need the money. okay?

163
00:08:11.366 --> 00:08:13.618
(car starting)

164
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.746

Flying dinosaur. 11.

167
00:08:31.553 --> 00:08:32.971
Is it. I don't know.

168
00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.764
why don't you ever
drive-a-saurus?

169
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.102
It's never 11 letters.

170
00:08:56.453 --> 00:08:58.204
How about a game of I spy?

171
00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:00.248
(Jack sighing)

172
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.418
I spy with my little eye

173
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.795
something beginning with Q.

174
00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:29.069

Oh my god.

181
00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:32.007
I'm gonna wake up in a minute.

182
00:10:32.048 --> 00:10:34.467
Things always look
worse in the dark.

183
00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.015
What the fuck is that?

184
00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:12.672
I'll leave you to it.

185
00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:26.895
(somber music)

186
00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.226
(sighing)

187
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.013
(birds chirping)

188
00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:15.128
(uplifting music)

189
00:13:21.343 --> 00:13:24.179
(faucet creaking)

190
00:13:25.472 --> 00:13:28.308
(pipes vibrating)

191
00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:32.312
(splashing)

192
00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:41.738
(Jack exclaiming)

193
00:14:03.343 --> 00:14:06.846
(critter snarling)
Huh!?

194
00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:13.436
(rattling)

195
00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.332
(Robert sighing)

196
00:14:34.374 --> 00:14:36.418
Pass me the knifey bit.

197
00:14:50.724 --> 00:14:52.142
At least the view's quite good.

198
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:55.729
That's what you're calling

199
00:14:55.770 --> 00:14:59.524
one of the most spectacular
convergences of nature ever?

200
00:14:59.566 --> 00:15:00.400
The view?

201
00:15:01.276 --> 00:15:02.277
You haven't even looked at it.

202
00:15:03.903 --> 00:15:06.197
Two cypress trees
frame the compositions

203
00:15:06.239 --> 00:15:07.907
subconsciously
propelling the eye

204
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:10.869
across the negative space
toward the focal point

205
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.747
of the perfectly central villa.

206
00:15:13.788 --> 00:15:16.916
all unified by these magnificent

207
00:15:16.958 --> 00:15:18.626
undulating Tuscany hills.

208
00:15:20.337 --> 00:15:22.756
Late afternoon. remember.

209
00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:25.967
The way the light
hits those windows

210
00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:27.177
takes your breath away.

211
00:15:28.094 --> 00:15:30.138
No. that's the dust doing that.

212
00:15:31.598 --> 00:15:33.767
I mean how could you
let it go like this?

213
00:15:36.019 --> 00:15:37.145
(car honking)

214
00:15:37.187 --> 00:15:39.272
Oh an interruption.
what a shame.

215
00:15:39.314 --> 00:15:40.607
Must be the estate agent.

216
00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:41.649
Damn. she's early.

217
00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:45.278
We'll mark the view as a 10

218
00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.281
but the potholes down that
drive are a serious drawback.

219
00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:49.908
I may have whiplash.

220
00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:50.909
One of you is Jack?

221
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:51.743
I'm Jack.

222
00:15:51.785 --> 00:15:52.577
Kate Lewis.

223
00:15:52.619 --> 00:15:53.745
Jack.

224
00:15:53.787 --> 00:15:54.913
Sorry. I've said that.

225
00:15:54.954 --> 00:15:55.747
Robert.

226
00:15:55.789 --> 00:15:56.748
Hello.

227
00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:59.125
Now. let's see
what we have here.

228
00:16:02.170 --> 00:16:04.172
Not perhaps the best
first impression.

229
00:16:04.214 --> 00:16:06.508
Things can only get better.

230
00:16:06.549 --> 00:16:07.759
Front door?

231
00:16:07.801 --> 00:16:08.635
Ah...

232
00:16:20.814 --> 00:16:22.315
Well I don't even
know what to say

233
00:16:22.357 --> 00:16:24.192
about this whole situation.

234
00:16:24.234 --> 00:16:25.860
Do you know Frank Swine?

235
00:16:25.902 --> 00:16:26.820
Should I?

236
00:16:26.861 --> 00:16:29.656
That is my homage to his style.

237
00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.825
You painted it?

238
00:16:34.661 --> 00:16:35.495
I see.

239
00:16:47.007 --> 00:16:50.176
(banging in distance)

240
00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:57.100
(toilet flushing)

241
00:17:02.022 --> 00:17:03.648
There's a large
hole in your roof.

242
00:17:03.690 --> 00:17:06.026
Yes. but it's got great bones.

243
00:17:06.067 --> 00:17:07.235
Don't you think Kate?

244
00:17:07.277 --> 00:17:09.738
Or you prefer Katie?

245
00:17:09.779 --> 00:17:12.240
Just Kate. plain Kate.

246
00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:13.116
A bonny Kate.

247
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.827
And sometimes Kate the cursed.

248
00:17:15.869 --> 00:17:19.080
but Kate. the prettiest
Kate in Christendom.

249
00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:26.629
From the Taming of the.

250
00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:28.882
The shrew?

251
00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:30.800
By Shakespeare.

252
00:17:33.303 --> 00:17:36.848
Do you think we can
make a quick sale. Kate?

253
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.350
Well that depends.

254
00:17:38.391 --> 00:17:39.476
On?

255
00:17:39.517 --> 00:17:41.394
On whether you hope
to make a profit.

256
00:17:41.436 --> 00:17:43.688
Tuscany is a romantic idyll.

257
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:45.607
It's why all my
clients come here.

258
00:17:45.648 --> 00:17:48.193
If I were to bring them to
this house in this state

259
00:17:48.234 --> 00:17:49.194
they will say to me.

260
00:17:49.235 --> 00:17:52.072
"Kate. you promised me a dream.

261
00:17:52.113 --> 00:17:54.366
"A dream orchestrated by Puccini

262
00:17:54.407 --> 00:17:56.284
"in which my worries
would just float off

263
00:17:56.326 --> 00:17:57.869
"into the infinity pool.

264
00:17:57.911 --> 00:18:01.289
"But instead you have
delivered me a building site

265
00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:04.459
"whose walls seem to have
been painted by Mussolini."

266
00:18:06.461 --> 00:18:07.837
Having said all that.

267
00:18:09.172 --> 00:18:10.715
if you put your backs into it

268
00:18:10.757 --> 00:18:13.468
I don't see why you
couldn't turn this around.

269
00:18:13.510 --> 00:18:16.471
In the plus column. your
plumbing seems to work.

270
00:18:16.513 --> 00:18:17.764
People care about that.

271
00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:21.768
And I like. as you
say. its bones.

272
00:18:31.027 --> 00:18:33.279
(birds chirping)

273
00:18:33.321 --> 00:18:34.781
I wouldn't if I were you.

274
00:18:35.824 --> 00:18:36.991
It's about to rain.

275
00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.832
(thunder booming)

276
00:18:43.873 --> 00:18:46.793
(melancholy music)

277
00:19:15.321 --> 00:19:17.490
(banging)

278
00:19:20.076 --> 00:19:22.537
(sighing)

279
00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:25.331
(birds chirping)

280
00:19:34.424 --> 00:19:36.468
I wouldn't go on the
bathroom for a while

281
00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.011
if I were you.

282
00:19:38.053 --> 00:19:39.971
There's a large
weasel in the sink.

283
00:19:40.013 --> 00:19:41.848
That's not a euphemism.

284
00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:45.310
No. we'll get what we can
for the house. isn't it?

285
00:19:45.352 --> 00:19:49.314
It'll be fuck all.

286
00:19:49.356 --> 00:19:51.232
But this is
impossible on my own.

287
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.196
Or we could keep it.

288
00:19:56.237 --> 00:19:57.405
Except the weasel.

289
00:19:57.447 --> 00:19:59.324
They're too friendly
for my liking.

290
00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.826
Listen. we are going
to sell this house

291
00:20:01.868 --> 00:20:03.078
one way or another.

292
00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:03.995
Get on board with that.

293
00:20:04.037 --> 00:20:04.829
Where are you going?

294
00:20:04.871 --> 00:20:06.206
I've got a gallery to buy.

295
00:20:07.207 --> 00:20:07.999
(door slamming)

296
00:20:08.041 --> 00:20:10.210
(revving)

297
00:20:14.631 --> 00:20:17.008
(phone ringing)

298
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:18.343
Jack. what do you want?

299
00:20:18.385 --> 00:20:19.469
Ruth.

300
00:20:19.511 --> 00:20:21.513
I just wanted you
to know I'm in Italy

301
00:20:21.554 --> 00:20:24.599
and I persuaded my
dad to sell the house.

302
00:20:24.641 --> 00:20:25.600
So?

303
00:20:25.642 --> 00:20:27.894
So it means I can
buy the gallery.

304
00:20:27.936 --> 00:20:31.022
Sorry. you were
actually being serious.

305
00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:33.733
It's on the market. it's
already been in trust.

306
00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:35.402
You said I had a month.

307
00:20:37.904 --> 00:20:41.408
(melancholy guitar music)

308
00:21:08.810 --> 00:21:11.104
(crashing)

309
00:21:18.278 --> 00:21:20.655
Do you need some help
knocking the others over?

310
00:21:22.157 --> 00:21:24.951
(birds chirping)

311
00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:42.844
(chain clinking)

312
00:21:49.809 --> 00:21:52.312
(light music)

313
00:21:55.398 --> 00:21:57.609
Are you always this busy?

314
00:21:57.650 --> 00:21:58.902
Mondays I'm closed.

315
00:22:04.407 --> 00:22:05.241
So.

316
00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:09.162
Where did you learn
to speak English?

317
00:22:11.498 --> 00:22:12.707
Bugs Bunny.

318
00:22:12.749 --> 00:22:13.667
Huh?

319
00:22:13.708 --> 00:22:14.668
Bugs Bunny.

320
00:22:17.003 --> 00:22:18.546
In Italian schools.
kids are forced

321
00:22:18.588 --> 00:22:20.173
to watch cartoons
for five hours a day

322
00:22:20.215 --> 00:22:21.800
just to learn English.

323
00:22:21.841 --> 00:22:22.717
Really?

324
00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:23.635
Mhmm.

325
00:22:23.677 --> 00:22:24.552
It's the laws.

326
00:22:25.428 --> 00:22:26.304
I had no idea.

327
00:22:26.346 --> 00:22:28.014
That's actually pretty cool.

328
00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:30.975
Of course not.

329
00:22:31.017 --> 00:22:32.644
I lived in England for a year.

330
00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:34.646
I worked in a restaurant there.

331
00:22:34.688 --> 00:22:37.148
And you. you're on holiday?

332
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:38.566
Oh. no. no. I wish.

333
00:22:40.068 --> 00:22:42.696
I'm actually here to
sell an old family house.

334
00:22:42.737 --> 00:22:44.239
I see. where?

335
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:46.241
It's out of town towards Pienza.

336
00:22:52.622 --> 00:22:53.581
Oh my gosh.

337
00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:55.709
This is amazing.

338
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:56.584
I know.

339
00:22:57.711 --> 00:22:59.838
Is your house near
the deserted house?

340
00:22:59.879 --> 00:23:01.381
It's probably the same one.

341
00:23:03.466 --> 00:23:04.759
With the beautiful lake?

342
00:23:05.719 --> 00:23:06.511
Mhmm.

343
00:23:06.553 --> 00:23:08.263
I love that house.

344
00:23:08.304 --> 00:23:09.139
Really?

345
00:23:11.391 --> 00:23:12.225
You wanna buy it?

346
00:23:13.351 --> 00:23:16.438
Well. I can only pay
you with risotto.

347
00:23:16.479 --> 00:23:18.231
How many bowls do
you want for it?

348
00:23:21.484 --> 00:23:23.028
Three should do it.

349
00:23:23.069 --> 00:23:25.488
And I want a nice bottle of red.

350
00:23:28.241 --> 00:23:29.617
You obviously don't understand

351
00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:30.910
how good this risotto is.

352
00:23:33.413 --> 00:23:34.247
Okay. fine.

353
00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:35.915
Two bottles.

354
00:23:38.251 --> 00:23:39.669
They have to be big ones.

355
00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:45.383
I haven't even seen what
it looks like inside.

356
00:23:45.425 --> 00:23:49.262
(coughing) Well. that's
the main selling point.

357
00:23:53.767 --> 00:23:55.226
(light music)

358
00:23:55.268 --> 00:23:58.396
Thank you for the
really lovely food.

359
00:23:58.438 --> 00:23:59.606
(Woman speaks in
foreign language)

360
00:23:59.647 --> 00:24:01.566
You know you're lucky
to have that house.

361
00:24:01.608 --> 00:24:02.901
So pretty.

362
00:24:02.942 --> 00:24:04.235
No.

363
00:24:04.277 --> 00:24:05.445
It needs a ton of work.

364
00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.907
This took me five years to fix.

365
00:24:08.948 --> 00:24:09.783
But now.

366
00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:11.534
Five years?

367
00:24:13.119 --> 00:24:14.829
I don't even have five weeks.

368
00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:15.705
Anyway.

369
00:24:16.706 --> 00:24:17.749
(Woman speaks in
foreign language)

370
00:24:17.791 --> 00:24:19.084
Jack.

371
00:24:19.125 --> 00:24:20.168
Natalia.

372
00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:24.798
(speaks in foreign
language) Natalia.

373
00:24:38.144 --> 00:24:41.189
(light somber music)

374
00:25:25.567 --> 00:25:27.694
When I first saw this house.

375
00:25:28.862 --> 00:25:32.073
you can't imagine
how stunning it was.

376
00:25:36.953 --> 00:25:37.912
I've been thinking.

377
00:25:39.706 --> 00:25:41.708
It deserves to have
its history honored.

378
00:25:44.127 --> 00:25:47.213
Well. whatever we do.
I need to do it quick.

379
00:25:48.256 --> 00:25:49.090
Right.

380
00:25:50.383 --> 00:25:51.593
Start tomorrow then?

381
00:25:53.428 --> 00:25:54.262
Properly?

382
00:26:14.157 --> 00:26:17.118
This place has not
changed at all.

383
00:26:18.453 --> 00:26:20.747
Good. okay.

384
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:23.416
I've divided the jobs up
into the ones we can do

385
00:26:24.668 --> 00:26:26.419
and ones we need
professionals for.

386
00:26:27.796 --> 00:26:29.464
Maybe Kate will
know some workmen.

387
00:26:30.965 --> 00:26:31.800
What do you think?

388
00:26:33.468 --> 00:26:34.302
Dad?

389
00:26:37.097 --> 00:26:38.264
Did you ever see this film?

390
00:26:38.306 --> 00:26:39.724
No.

391
00:26:39.766 --> 00:26:41.726
I say we do the painting
ourselves. downstairs first

392
00:26:41.768 --> 00:26:43.436
then we hit the bedrooms.

393
00:26:43.478 --> 00:26:44.437
Or maybe we just.

394
00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:47.482
are you listening at all?

395
00:26:47.524 --> 00:26:49.234
I'm multitasking.

396
00:26:49.275 --> 00:26:50.110
Uh huh.

397
00:26:51.111 --> 00:26:52.362
What did I say then?

398
00:26:52.404 --> 00:26:54.906
You said something
fascinating about painting.

399
00:26:54.948 --> 00:26:57.909
Anyway. you're getting
way ahead of yourself.

400
00:26:57.951 --> 00:27:00.453
We've got a far bigger
problem on our hands.

401
00:27:03.623 --> 00:27:04.416
So?

402
00:27:04.457 --> 00:27:05.250
Just a minute.

403
00:27:05.291 --> 00:27:07.961
Okay. let me look then.

404
00:27:09.671 --> 00:27:10.463
It's still there.

405
00:27:10.505 --> 00:27:11.297
Okay. well what's the plan?

406
00:27:11.339 --> 00:27:12.924
Make it jump out the window.

407
00:27:12.966 --> 00:27:14.092
How are we supposed to do that?

408
00:27:14.134 --> 00:27:15.301
One. two. three. war.

409
00:27:17.178 --> 00:27:18.096
What?

410
00:27:18.138 --> 00:27:19.431
It's a classic technique. Jack.

411
00:27:19.472 --> 00:27:20.974
Tried and tested.

412
00:27:21.016 --> 00:27:22.100
One. two. three?

413
00:27:22.142 --> 00:27:22.976
War!

414
00:27:27.731 --> 00:27:28.690
Let me get this straight.

415
00:27:28.732 --> 00:27:29.524
You're saying we
charge the weasel

416
00:27:29.566 --> 00:27:31.609
and hope it commits suicide?

417
00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:32.485
Out the window.

418
00:27:34.487 --> 00:27:35.864
The window isn't even open!

419
00:27:36.823 --> 00:27:38.283
You have a better idea?

420
00:27:38.324 --> 00:27:39.492
Wiseli.
Ferret.

421
00:27:39.534 --> 00:27:40.869
Feratu. feratu.

422
00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:42.787
No. no. no (speaks in
foreign language) (growling)

423
00:27:42.829 --> 00:27:44.122
It's like a rat but.
It's big.

424
00:27:44.164 --> 00:27:45.290
Good teeth.

425
00:27:45.331 --> 00:27:46.332
The size of a baguette.

426
00:27:46.374 --> 00:27:48.460
like a rat baguette.

427
00:27:48.501 --> 00:27:52.672
(light music in
foreign language)

428
00:28:00.930 --> 00:28:01.973
Rough translation.

429
00:28:02.015 --> 00:28:03.016
Very doable.

430
00:28:07.854 --> 00:28:09.898
Again and I'm paraphrasing here.

431
00:28:09.939 --> 00:28:11.107
Not a problem.

432
00:28:12.025 --> 00:28:14.819
(men chattering)

433
00:28:14.861 --> 00:28:17.405
Great news. couldn't be better?

434
00:28:17.447 --> 00:28:19.449
You're a fast learner.

435
00:28:30.919 --> 00:28:34.089
(drill whirring)

436
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:36.299
(rasping)

437
00:28:47.477 --> 00:28:50.563
(machinery whirring)

438
00:28:52.107 --> 00:28:54.609
(saw rasping)

439
00:29:06.746 --> 00:29:07.580
Dad?

440
00:29:09.749 --> 00:29:10.583
Dad?

441
00:29:12.085 --> 00:29:14.212
Do you want to take a picture
of the mural or something?

442
00:29:14.254 --> 00:29:15.338
Do I what?

443
00:29:15.380 --> 00:29:17.048
Well. we're gonna
have to paint over it.

444
00:29:17.090 --> 00:29:19.300
I just wondered if
you wanted a memento.

445
00:29:19.342 --> 00:29:21.553
You're planning on removing
one of my paintings?

446
00:29:21.594 --> 00:29:22.554
It's just to give the buyers

447
00:29:22.595 --> 00:29:24.389
half a chance of
being practical.

448
00:29:24.431 --> 00:29:25.557
Why?

449
00:29:25.598 --> 00:29:26.891
Are you expecting
them to be as blind

450
00:29:26.933 --> 00:29:29.310
to the beauty of
contemporary art as you?

451
00:29:29.352 --> 00:29:32.272
Look. obviously it's not
without artistic merit.

452
00:29:32.313 --> 00:29:33.898
Not without artistic merit?

453
00:29:33.940 --> 00:29:35.984
Is that your
professional opinion?

454
00:29:38.111 --> 00:29:39.154
What's that supposed to mean?

455
00:29:39.195 --> 00:29:42.240
Those who can. do. Jack.

456
00:29:42.282 --> 00:29:44.576
Those who can't run
their wife's gallery.

457
00:29:44.617 --> 00:29:46.119
Wait a minute!

458
00:29:46.161 --> 00:29:47.746
If you're so bloody can-do.

459
00:29:47.787 --> 00:29:49.414
where are your paintings huh?

460
00:29:49.456 --> 00:29:51.291
You haven't done
anything in forever.

461
00:29:51.332 --> 00:29:52.667
Not true.

462
00:29:52.709 --> 00:29:53.918
In the last five years.

463
00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:56.171
I've completed several
paintings actually.

464
00:29:56.212 --> 00:29:57.505
I'm warning you. Jack.

465
00:29:57.547 --> 00:29:59.758
You touch that wall and
I will not be responsible

466
00:29:59.799 --> 00:30:01.092
for the consequences.

467
00:30:01.134 --> 00:30:03.470
I will not lift another
finger around here!

468
00:30:05.472 --> 00:30:06.806
What's going on in there?

469
00:30:18.401 --> 00:30:19.235
Wow.

470
00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.405
Don't dare patronize me.

471
00:30:25.325 --> 00:30:27.327
The ones you finished
as good as this?

472
00:30:28.370 --> 00:30:29.454
They're terrible.

473
00:30:29.496 --> 00:30:32.374
I don't know if I'd
incinerate them.

474
00:30:33.333 --> 00:30:36.086
(birds chirping)

475
00:30:42.050 --> 00:30:44.678
No. no. I've had enough of this.

476
00:30:45.887 --> 00:30:47.055
We're in Italy.

477
00:30:47.097 --> 00:30:48.723
The least we can do
is have a decent meal.

478
00:30:50.684 --> 00:30:55.271
(crowd chattering
in foreign language)

479
00:31:10.036 --> 00:31:12.539
(light music)

480
00:31:20.046 --> 00:31:21.464
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

481
00:31:21.506 --> 00:31:22.882
(speaks in foreign language)
Now this is more like it.

482
00:31:22.924 --> 00:31:24.509
Tonight. they screen
a movie in the square.

483
00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:25.844
always very popular.

484
00:31:25.885 --> 00:31:27.721
But first. everyone
comes for dinner.

485
00:31:28.763 --> 00:31:29.556
(speaks in foreign
language) I'm Natalia.

486
00:31:29.597 --> 00:31:30.432
Shit.

487
00:31:30.473 --> 00:31:31.599
Robert. I'm honored.
Sorry.

488
00:31:31.641 --> 00:31:32.934
My dad.

489
00:31:32.976 --> 00:31:33.768
Roberto.

490
00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.895
It looks like you're full.

491
00:31:35.937 --> 00:31:36.896
We'll find room.

492
00:31:37.939 --> 00:31:40.942
(jazzy blues music)

493
00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:05.050
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

494
00:32:05.091 --> 00:32:06.134
Okay.

495
00:32:06.176 --> 00:32:08.053
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

496
00:32:08.094 --> 00:32:10.764
(guests speaks in
foreign language)

497
00:32:10.805 --> 00:32:13.141
Excuse my family.
they're celebrating.

498
00:32:13.183 --> 00:32:14.267
Oh. your family?

499
00:32:14.309 --> 00:32:15.727
Yes. it's my brother
in law's birthday.

500
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:16.561
(man speaks in foreign language)

501
00:32:16.603 --> 00:32:17.645
That's my sister. Clara.

502
00:32:17.687 --> 00:32:18.730
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

503
00:32:18.772 --> 00:32:22.150
(Robert speaks in
foreign language)

504
00:32:22.192 --> 00:32:24.444
Oh my god. this is amazing.

505
00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.991
(guests chanting in
foreign language)

506
00:32:30.033 --> 00:32:33.745
(guests applauding and laughing)

507
00:32:33.787 --> 00:32:35.246
Probably on a Tinder date.

508
00:32:35.288 --> 00:32:36.331
On a what?

509
00:32:36.373 --> 00:32:37.457
Tinder.

510
00:32:37.499 --> 00:32:39.250
You know what Tinder is.

511
00:32:39.292 --> 00:32:41.294
It's an app. You
know what an app is.

512
00:32:41.336 --> 00:32:43.254
Yeah. I know what a
bloody app is. Jack.

513
00:32:43.296 --> 00:32:45.465
Okay. well. Tinder's
a sort of dating app.

514
00:32:45.507 --> 00:32:46.591
On a computer?

515
00:32:46.633 --> 00:32:48.259
No. it's an app.
it's on your phone.

516
00:32:48.301 --> 00:32:49.260
On your phone?

517
00:32:49.302 --> 00:32:50.804
Yes. it's an app.

518
00:32:50.845 --> 00:32:51.930
Just stop saying it's
some fucking app.

519
00:32:51.971 --> 00:32:53.139
Well it is.

520
00:32:53.181 --> 00:32:54.307
Ugh. I despair.

521
00:32:54.349 --> 00:32:55.934
What happened to dancing?

522
00:32:55.975 --> 00:32:58.311
The well timed drink?

523
00:32:58.353 --> 00:33:00.605
The miracle of a
chance encounter?

524
00:33:00.647 --> 00:33:02.691
Well now. they've
got this algorithm

525
00:33:02.732 --> 00:33:05.318
that replaces chance
with probability

526
00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.946
so you're less likely
to be disappointed.

527
00:33:07.987 --> 00:33:09.447
Oh. bullshit.

528
00:33:09.489 --> 00:33:12.283
Disappointment is an
absolute certainty.

529
00:33:12.325 --> 00:33:15.036
Everyone lets everyone
down at some point.

530
00:33:15.078 --> 00:33:18.456
How you come back from
that. that's romance.

531
00:33:18.498 --> 00:33:19.290

532

Roberto.

537
00:33:26.006 --> 00:33:26.965
Okay.

538
00:33:27.007 --> 00:33:28.299
Oh. are you English?

539
00:33:28.341 --> 00:33:29.134

(speaks in foreign language)

541
00:33:40.729 --> 00:33:42.147
Marzio.

542
00:33:42.188 --> 00:33:43.023
Natalia.

543
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.651

(man speaks in foreign language)

557
00:34:40.080 --> 00:34:40.872
Maybe so.

558
00:34:40.914 --> 00:34:42.540
Maybe so. (laughing)

559
00:34:42.582 --> 00:34:43.375
Excuse me.

560
00:34:43.416 --> 00:34:45.085
Natalia has told me

561
00:34:45.126 --> 00:34:46.836
about your (speaks
in foreign language).

562
00:34:47.754 --> 00:34:48.546
(Robert speaks in
foreign language)

563
00:34:48.588 --> 00:34:50.715
I am very old but I remember

564
00:34:50.757 --> 00:34:53.718
the family that
owned that house.

565
00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:54.678
Their name was.

566
00:34:56.137 --> 00:34:56.971
Pazzini.

567
00:34:58.348 --> 00:35:00.266
That was my wife's family.

568
00:35:00.308 --> 00:35:01.142
You?

569
00:35:01.184 --> 00:35:03.395
You married the Pazzini girl?

570
00:35:03.436 --> 00:35:04.396
(Robert speaks in
foreign language)

571
00:35:04.437 --> 00:35:06.147
Wonderful.

573
00:35:23.873 --> 00:35:27.293

(somber music)

578
00:36:22.891 --> 00:36:24.726
Amazing view.

579
00:36:26.227 --> 00:36:27.520
Amazing view.

580
00:36:32.108 --> 00:36:33.943
Did you like the film?

581
00:36:36.196 --> 00:36:38.740
I couldn't understand any of it.

582
00:36:38.782 --> 00:36:40.450
And half of me is from here.

583
00:36:45.121 --> 00:36:46.790
I heard about your mother. Jack.

584
00:36:49.542 --> 00:36:50.377
I'm sorry.

585
00:36:51.711 --> 00:36:53.254
Yeah.

586
00:36:53.296 --> 00:36:55.757
I must have been able to
speak some Italian once.

587
00:36:59.052 --> 00:37:01.304
Can't remember anything.

588
00:37:08.895 --> 00:37:12.357
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

589
00:37:12.399 --> 00:37:13.233
You repeat.

(Jack speaks in

595
00:37:28.832 --> 00:37:29.666
Amazing view.

596
00:37:33.003 --> 00:37:34.379
Hey. you two!

597
00:37:34.421 --> 00:37:36.548
This man has a
birthday to celebrate.

598
00:37:36.589 --> 00:37:37.882
Come on!

599
00:37:37.924 --> 00:37:40.176
(laughing)

00:37:51.604 --> 00:37:55.775

(revving)

602
00:37:58.611 --> 00:37:59.821
Woo!

00:37:59.863 --> 00:38:01.990
(Natalia speaks in

(Luigi speaks in

605
00:38:04.284 --> 00:38:06.411
Wow. this is such a rare Vespa!

606
00:38:06.453 --> 00:38:08.580
Guys. who did this?!

607
00:38:08.621 --> 00:38:09.914
Guilty.

608
00:38:09.956 --> 00:38:11.750
No guilty. you are (speaks
in foreign language).

609
00:38:11.791 --> 00:38:12.959
Luigi.

610
00:38:13.001 --> 00:38:14.753
How the hell did you
get that thing going?

611
00:38:14.794 --> 00:38:17.422
(revving)

612
00:38:17.464 --> 00:38:20.508
(light bright music)

(camera clicking)

615
00:38:52.082 --> 00:38:52.916
Ooh.

616
00:38:53.750 --> 00:38:54.918
Very dramatic.

617
00:38:55.919 --> 00:38:58.338
And you have all the whiskey.

618
00:39:05.595 --> 00:39:07.263
Who's this?

619
00:39:08.348 --> 00:39:10.517
That's my daughter. Anna.

620
00:39:10.558 --> 00:39:11.393
She's eight.

621
00:39:12.519 --> 00:39:13.311
And a quarter.

622
00:39:13.353 --> 00:39:14.521
Don't forget the quarter.

623
00:39:15.522 --> 00:39:19.317
She looks just like you.

624
00:39:19.359 --> 00:39:20.193
Here.

625
00:39:33.373 --> 00:39:34.374
This is?

626
00:39:35.917 --> 00:39:37.544
Her father.

627
00:39:37.585 --> 00:39:39.170
The guy from the restaurant?

628
00:39:39.212 --> 00:39:40.380
He's my ex-husband.

629
00:39:42.048 --> 00:39:43.550
I fight and win the divorce.

630
00:39:44.718 --> 00:39:46.386
I fight to save my baby.

631
00:39:49.723 --> 00:39:51.766
She's the only thing
that matters. but.

632
00:39:53.226 --> 00:39:54.102
I lose.

633
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:58.565
Because he lied about me.

634
00:40:00.066 --> 00:40:01.901
So I only got her half the time

635
00:40:04.738 --> 00:40:06.072
and some holidays.

636
00:40:08.658 --> 00:40:11.911
God I'm so sorry. Natalia.

637
00:40:13.121 --> 00:40:14.581
We have very good holidays.

638
00:40:17.334 --> 00:40:20.378
(scooter revving)

639
00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.212
Natalia!

640
00:40:21.254 --> 00:40:22.213
Luigi!

641
00:40:22.255 --> 00:40:23.256
(Luigi speaks in
foreign language)

642
00:40:23.298 --> 00:40:24.674
This is really fun!

643
00:40:33.141 --> 00:40:33.933
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

644
00:40:33.975 --> 00:40:34.809
Hey!

645
00:40:42.776 --> 00:40:43.651
This is good.

646
00:40:43.693 --> 00:40:45.111
Nah. it's okay.
No. no. no. no.

647
00:40:45.153 --> 00:40:46.571
I mean. this is pretty.

648
00:40:46.613 --> 00:40:47.489
Thank you.
It's beautiful!

649
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:48.615
Like me. ah.

650
00:40:48.656 --> 00:40:49.741
It's pretty wonderful.

651
00:40:49.783 --> 00:40:50.909
Luigi!

652
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:51.785
Luigi!

653
00:40:53.370 --> 00:40:54.829
Wait. wait.

654
00:40:54.871 --> 00:40:55.955
Excuse us.

655
00:40:55.997 --> 00:40:56.831
Stay down.

656
00:41:01.628 --> 00:41:02.587
Ah. no Roberto no.
please. please.

657
00:41:02.629 --> 00:41:04.297
Don't move. I work fast.

658
00:41:08.677 --> 00:41:10.345
Have you painted many port--
Shh.

659
00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:28.613
Can I see it?

660
00:41:28.655 --> 00:41:29.989
Okay.

661
00:41:30.031 --> 00:41:31.658
But remember. you'll hate it.

662
00:41:32.826 --> 00:41:36.538
People. they're no good
at seeing themselves.

663
00:41:39.708 --> 00:41:41.084
Okay. I'm ready.

664
00:41:47.841 --> 00:41:50.093
(laughing)

665
00:41:52.053 --> 00:41:54.514
Once you get the eyes.
you're basically there.

666
00:41:54.556 --> 00:41:55.807
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

667
00:41:55.849 --> 00:41:58.560
Roberto. where did you
get this amazing bike?

668
00:41:59.519 --> 00:42:01.396
My wife found it. I think.

669
00:42:07.694 --> 00:42:10.030
Why do you always do that?

670
00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:12.657
What?

671
00:42:12.699 --> 00:42:14.909
If you ever referred to Mum

672
00:42:14.951 --> 00:42:17.579
which is practically never.

673
00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:22.167
why is it always my
wife. your mother?

674
00:42:22.208 --> 00:42:25.045
Why do you never use her name?

675
00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:31.885
She's called Raffaella.

676
00:42:32.719 --> 00:42:35.430
Yeah. okay. Raffaella.

677
00:42:35.472 --> 00:42:37.891
And why is that bike
all that's left of her

678
00:42:37.932 --> 00:42:38.933
in this whole house?

679
00:42:38.975 --> 00:42:41.853
I mean that's weird. isn't it?

680
00:42:41.895 --> 00:42:43.438
It's like she didn't exist!

681
00:42:45.774 --> 00:42:48.193
I think you've had too
much to drink. Jack.

682
00:42:48.234 --> 00:42:51.946
If you cared about her at all.

683
00:42:51.988 --> 00:42:54.574
why would you let
her house fall apart?

684
00:42:55.784 --> 00:42:58.161
Jack. we have guests.

685
00:43:01.748 --> 00:43:03.833
Of course. guests.

686
00:43:05.126 --> 00:43:08.630
Sorry I can't do the
Foster charm to order.

687
00:43:10.423 --> 00:43:11.591
I'll leave that to you.

688
00:43:21.643 --> 00:43:22.477
Jack?

689
00:43:23.770 --> 00:43:24.604
Wait.

690
00:43:29.442 --> 00:43:30.777
You know. we didn't
have one conversation

691
00:43:30.819 --> 00:43:32.320
about Mum after she died.

692
00:43:33.947 --> 00:43:34.781
Not one.

693
00:43:37.033 --> 00:43:39.035
He never even
mentioned her death.

694
00:43:41.121 --> 00:43:44.416
He just. he told
me about how I had

695
00:43:44.457 --> 00:43:45.792
to become a man now.

696
00:43:48.294 --> 00:43:49.587
Which is a fucking joke

697
00:43:49.629 --> 00:43:51.840
because what does he
know about being a man?

698
00:43:55.635 --> 00:43:57.971
I really tried to
be a man for him.

699
00:44:00.306 --> 00:44:02.475
I didn't cry at the funeral.

700
00:44:03.518 --> 00:44:04.853
I was so proud of that.

701
00:44:06.479 --> 00:44:07.772
I look at seven year olds now

702
00:44:07.814 --> 00:44:10.316
and half of them cry when
they drop an ice cream.

703
00:44:13.528 --> 00:44:14.654
But I didn't cry.

704
00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:24.164
I don't think I
know how to grieve.

705
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.502
(somber music)

706
00:44:29.544 --> 00:44:34.007
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

707
00:44:46.686 --> 00:44:47.520
Wait.

708
00:44:51.691 --> 00:44:52.984
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

709
00:44:53.026 --> 00:44:57.364

(Marzio speaks in
foreign language)

716
00:45:22.722 --> 00:45:24.099
Natalia?

717
00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:25.600
No. it's fine.

718
00:45:25.642 --> 00:45:27.727
I just. it's fine.

719
00:45:30.897 --> 00:45:33.441
(somber music)

720
00:45:40.573 --> 00:45:42.784
(scraping)

721
00:45:55.296 --> 00:45:58.717
(phone ringing)

722
00:45:58.758 --> 00:46:01.469
This is Ruth.
leave me a message.

723
00:46:01.511 --> 00:46:03.054
Ruth. it's Jack.

724
00:46:03.096 --> 00:46:06.474
Listen. please don't sell
the gallery to anyone else.

725
00:46:06.516 --> 00:46:07.809
I'm serious about buying it.

726
00:46:07.851 --> 00:46:09.686
Just don't do anything hasty.

727
00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:11.604
Please.

728
00:46:16.651 --> 00:46:18.820
(sighing)

729
00:46:20.697 --> 00:46:23.450
(birds chirping)

730

(thudding)

732
00:47:07.535 --> 00:47:10.538
(breathing heavily)

733
00:47:15.168 --> 00:47:19.839
There are some very
powerful lay lines here.

734
00:47:20.924 --> 00:47:21.841
Can you feel them?

735
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:25.720
Tuscany is very creative.

736
00:47:26.596 --> 00:47:29.432
Michelangelo. Rafael. Da Vinci.

737
00:47:31.101 --> 00:47:32.352
Mr. Foster here.

738
00:47:33.687 --> 00:47:34.521
They all feel it.

739
00:47:36.523 --> 00:47:37.691
Of course.

740
00:47:50.704 --> 00:47:52.914
(sniffing)

741
00:47:58.253 --> 00:47:59.838
Oh god.

742
00:47:59.879 --> 00:48:02.173
Don't touch the counter.

743
00:48:02.215 --> 00:48:03.133
It's still...

744
00:48:08.555 --> 00:48:09.556
White spirit.

745
00:48:14.602 --> 00:48:16.938
Stop. you're just
making it worse.

746
00:48:18.231 --> 00:48:20.066
This black mark is a sign.

747
00:48:21.735 --> 00:48:23.903
You can see that.
can't you. Kate?

748
00:48:24.779 --> 00:48:29.075
You know black is for
fear. for darkness.

749
00:48:31.244 --> 00:48:32.996
Right across my vagina.

750
00:48:39.252 --> 00:48:41.838
Have you ever read
Interiors magazine?

751
00:48:42.756 --> 00:48:43.590
Um...

752
00:48:45.675 --> 00:48:46.509
I thought not.

753
00:48:48.094 --> 00:48:50.388
If your creativity's
reach is only as far

754
00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:53.725
as toping large splashes of
misery over your surfaces.

755
00:48:53.767 --> 00:48:56.394
may I suggest you
enlist some outside help

756
00:48:56.436 --> 00:48:57.812
to guide you towards something

757
00:48:57.854 --> 00:49:00.774
more commercially advantageous?

758
00:49:06.446 --> 00:49:09.199
(birds chirping)

759
00:49:10.533 --> 00:49:12.619
(car revving)

760
00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:14.412
You know. I looked you up.

761
00:49:14.454 --> 00:49:16.122
I Googled you.

762
00:49:16.164 --> 00:49:17.082
Robert Foster.

763
00:49:17.123 --> 00:49:19.250
You were so good and successful

764
00:49:19.292 --> 00:49:21.294
and then poof. you disappeared.

765
00:49:22.545 --> 00:49:25.215
Well. I'm very flattered
you looked me up.

766
00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:29.844
Listen. I need to
ask you something.

767
00:49:29.886 --> 00:49:32.138
You did such an amazing
job with the interior

768
00:49:32.180 --> 00:49:33.139
of your restaurant.

769
00:49:34.391 --> 00:49:36.101
I was wondering if you
could give us some hints

770
00:49:36.142 --> 00:49:37.811
about decorating our house.

771
00:49:38.978 --> 00:49:40.522
Are you serious?

772
00:49:40.563 --> 00:49:42.232
I know exactly
what we should do.

773
00:49:48.238 --> 00:49:51.032
But I've been wanting
to ask you something.

774
00:49:51.074 --> 00:49:52.659
Why are you selling it?

775
00:49:52.701 --> 00:49:53.952
Jack is.

776
00:49:53.993 --> 00:49:55.370
Jack owns the house?

777
00:49:55.412 --> 00:49:56.371
We own half each.

778
00:49:57.539 --> 00:50:00.166
But Jack's memories
of the house are

779
00:50:00.208 --> 00:50:01.209
maybe not so good.

780
00:50:02.419 --> 00:50:04.337
That's why I sent him
to boarding school.

781
00:50:05.922 --> 00:50:07.382
You sent him away from you?

782
00:50:13.221 --> 00:50:14.055
I just.

783
00:50:15.181 --> 00:50:16.683
I didn't want him surrounded by

784
00:50:16.725 --> 00:50:19.519
reminders of his
mother. like me.

785
00:50:21.521 --> 00:50:24.149
And it's harder
when you can't ask

786
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:25.567
your best friend what to do.

787
00:50:28.778 --> 00:50:30.822
You know. he was
actually happy here once.

788
00:50:30.864 --> 00:50:33.324
I made him this swing
down by the lake.

789
00:50:33.366 --> 00:50:36.494
Just an old tire and a rope.

790
00:50:36.536 --> 00:50:37.954
God. he loved that thing.

791
00:50:43.209 --> 00:50:44.127
I have an idea.

792
00:50:45.295 --> 00:50:47.505
Why don't you
drive us into town?

793
00:50:47.547 --> 00:50:48.423
It's a really fun car.

794
00:50:48.465 --> 00:50:49.507
I don't drive.

795
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:51.051
I just don't.

796
00:50:54.304 --> 00:50:58.558
After what happened. because
of the circumstances.

797
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:03.563
I couldn't drive Jack.

798
00:51:06.399 --> 00:51:08.651
I couldn't drive
and couldn't paint.

799
00:51:20.288 --> 00:51:21.748
(grinder whirring)

800
00:51:21.790 --> 00:51:22.624
Oy!

801
00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:24.417
Oy!

802
00:51:24.459 --> 00:51:26.252
We've got guests.

803
00:51:26.294 --> 00:51:28.463
I've called in the cavalry.

804
00:51:28.505 --> 00:51:29.297
New color scheme.

805
00:51:29.339 --> 00:51:30.799
It's gonna look amazing!

806
00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:38.765
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

807
00:51:38.807 --> 00:51:39.641
Hi.

808
00:51:45.438 --> 00:51:47.232
(speaks in foreign language)

809
00:51:47.273 --> 00:51:48.566
(speaks in foreign language)

810
00:51:48.608 --> 00:51:51.903
(speaks in foreign language)

811
00:51:51.945 --> 00:51:53.613
She says your hair is all white.

812
00:51:57.117 --> 00:51:58.910
(Natalia laughing)

813
00:51:58.952 --> 00:51:59.994
Anna likes painting.

814
00:52:01.037 --> 00:52:01.955
Elephants mainly.

815
00:52:03.498 --> 00:52:05.959
(cute music)

816
00:52:21.307 --> 00:52:22.142
Anna!

817
00:52:23.810 --> 00:52:24.644
Anna!

818
00:52:27.063 --> 00:52:29.941
Anna (speaks in
foreign language)

819
00:52:29.983 --> 00:52:31.151
Look at you both.

820
00:52:31.192 --> 00:52:32.485
This is terrible.

821
00:52:36.823 --> 00:52:38.783
(laughing)

822
00:52:38.825 --> 00:52:42.996
Ana (speaks in foreign language)

823
00:52:43.038 --> 00:52:44.789
We have to thank you.

824
00:52:44.831 --> 00:52:46.124
You should be our
first dinner guest

825
00:52:46.166 --> 00:52:47.459
when we finish painting.

826
00:52:47.500 --> 00:52:49.002
Tomorrow night.

827
00:52:49.044 --> 00:52:50.628
Tomorrow night?

828
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:53.131
It's just a bit of paint. Jack.

829
00:52:53.173 --> 00:52:55.175
No one ever wants
to cook for a cook.

830
00:52:56.051 --> 00:52:59.637
I know my way around
a sun kissed tomato.

831
00:52:59.679 --> 00:53:02.515
Never doubt an artist
when he wants to create.

832
00:53:02.557 --> 00:53:03.725
(speaks in foreign language)
And then you can tell me

833
00:53:03.767 --> 00:53:05.894
the end of your
mountain climbing story.

834
00:53:06.853 --> 00:53:07.896
(speaks in foreign language)

835
00:53:07.937 --> 00:53:11.816
(Robert speaks in
foreign language)

836
00:53:11.858 --> 00:53:14.402
I know my way around
a sun kissed tomato?

837
00:53:15.528 --> 00:53:16.321
What?

838
00:53:16.363 --> 00:53:18.239
You can't even boil an egg.

839
00:53:18.281 --> 00:53:20.325
And what's this mountain
climbing bullshit?

840
00:53:20.367 --> 00:53:22.452
Well I went on a very
good walk near Chamonix.

841
00:53:23.411 --> 00:53:24.537
No. seriously.

842
00:53:24.579 --> 00:53:26.373
It took all afternoon.

843
00:53:26.414 --> 00:53:27.749
Right. you lazy ass.

844
00:53:27.791 --> 00:53:29.918
Come on. time waits for no man.

845
00:53:29.959 --> 00:53:32.879
Idle hands and all
that. chop chop.

846
00:53:33.922 --> 00:53:36.716
(birds chirping)

847
00:53:47.310 --> 00:53:50.397
(door chime dinging)

848
00:54:00.949 --> 00:54:02.033
(shopkeeper speaks
in foreign language)

849
00:54:02.075 --> 00:54:03.201
Hi.

850
00:54:03.243 --> 00:54:04.869
Do you speak English?

851
00:54:04.911 --> 00:54:05.745
(speaks in foreign
language) a little.

852
00:54:05.787 --> 00:54:06.871
Okay. great.

853
00:54:06.913 --> 00:54:09.082
So I need to cook a meal

854
00:54:09.124 --> 00:54:10.625
and it's for this
pretty amazing girl

855
00:54:10.667 --> 00:54:12.043
and she's a really good cook

856
00:54:12.085 --> 00:54:13.712
so I need to make
something great

857
00:54:13.753 --> 00:54:14.921
and I can't cook.

858
00:54:16.965 --> 00:54:19.718
I have a son too. I understand.

859
00:54:19.759 --> 00:54:20.677
Don't worry.

860
00:54:27.851 --> 00:54:28.810
Where have you been?

861
00:54:28.852 --> 00:54:30.770
She's gonna be
here in 30 minutes.

862
00:54:30.812 --> 00:54:32.731
What are you gonna
do about food?

863
00:54:32.772 --> 00:54:34.315
I can't give her
cheese on toast.

864
00:54:34.357 --> 00:54:35.942
She's a bloody chef!

865
00:54:35.984 --> 00:54:37.569
Keep your hair on.

866
00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:40.280
The woman at the deli said
this ragu's restaurant quality

867
00:54:40.321 --> 00:54:42.282
made specifically for her shop.

868
00:54:45.201 --> 00:54:49.539
(operatic song in
foreign language)

869
00:56:10.203 --> 00:56:11.705
(speaks in foreign language)

870
00:56:11.746 --> 00:56:14.541
Pff.
Pssh. (chuckling)

871
00:56:14.582 --> 00:56:16.376
But what's your secret?

872
00:56:17.794 --> 00:56:19.129
How did you do the onions?

873
00:56:23.049 --> 00:56:23.842
The onions?

874
00:56:23.883 --> 00:56:25.260
Mhmm.

875
00:56:25.301 --> 00:56:26.761
That's a very good question.

876
00:56:26.803 --> 00:56:29.806
I always think. the
secret with onions is to.

877
00:56:33.226 --> 00:56:34.853
I'm not good with
those cheffy terms

878
00:56:34.894 --> 00:56:36.396
you hear on TV.

879
00:56:36.438 --> 00:56:38.231
Jack. what do you call it?

880
00:56:40.066 --> 00:56:41.192
Oh. the--

881
00:56:41.234 --> 00:56:42.694
It's on the tip of my tongue.

882
00:56:42.736 --> 00:56:43.945
Stirring.

883
00:56:43.987 --> 00:56:44.863
No.

884
00:56:44.904 --> 00:56:45.697
Reduction.

885
00:56:45.739 --> 00:56:46.531
Reduction.

886
00:56:46.573 --> 00:56:47.365
Yeah.

887
00:56:47.407 --> 00:56:48.199
Yes.

888
00:56:48.241 --> 00:56:50.535
That's the one we reduce.

889
00:56:50.577 --> 00:56:52.037
And you have to stir it a lot.

890
00:56:52.078 --> 00:56:52.871
You're dead without
the stirring.

891
00:56:52.912 --> 00:56:54.205
There's a technique.

892
00:56:54.247 --> 00:56:56.291
Clockwise. anti-clockwise.

893
00:56:56.332 --> 00:56:59.919
Simmering and stirring
and reduction.

894
00:56:59.961 --> 00:57:02.380
It's an old family recipe.

895
00:57:02.422 --> 00:57:04.424
Oh. it's your family recipe?

896
00:57:09.596 --> 00:57:10.430
Well...

897
00:57:11.598 --> 00:57:13.975
Maybe more like the recipe of

898
00:57:15.101 --> 00:57:17.228
the lady who runs the shop

899
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:19.105
that I bought it from.

900
00:57:19.147 --> 00:57:19.981
Right.

901
00:57:22.317 --> 00:57:24.319
You've tasted this ragu before?

902
00:57:26.696 --> 00:57:29.866
I make it for her. (laughing)

903
00:57:36.289 --> 00:57:38.249
(Jack chuckling)

904
00:57:38.291 --> 00:57:39.626
Oh God.

905
00:57:39.668 --> 00:57:42.629
(crickets chirping)

906
00:57:44.297 --> 00:57:45.965
It's so peaceful here.

907
00:57:47.133 --> 00:57:48.635
This lake's the only
thing I remember

908
00:57:48.677 --> 00:57:49.511
about this plac.e

909
00:57:51.971 --> 00:57:54.349
There used to be this old
swing just over there.

910
00:57:56.226 --> 00:57:57.310
Over there?

911
00:57:59.145 --> 00:58:01.147
Your father told me about it.

912
00:58:01.189 --> 00:58:02.649
how he made it for you.

913
00:58:02.691 --> 00:58:04.025
Oh he didn't make it.

914
00:58:04.067 --> 00:58:06.528
I think it was just there.

915
00:58:06.569 --> 00:58:08.029
Well. until it broke.

916
00:58:13.868 --> 00:58:14.703
This swing?

917
00:58:17.664 --> 00:58:19.499
How the hell?

918
00:58:24.170 --> 00:58:25.005
I dare you.

919
00:58:26.172 --> 00:58:26.965
What?

920
00:58:27.007 --> 00:58:29.843
Ha. you're scared.

921
00:58:29.884 --> 00:58:31.344
I'm not scared.

922
00:58:33.847 --> 00:58:36.599
Do you want. you're daring
me to swing on this?

923
00:58:39.853 --> 00:58:40.645
Whoah!

924
00:58:40.687 --> 00:58:43.481
(splashing)

925
00:58:43.523 --> 00:58:44.315
Jack?

926
00:58:44.357 --> 00:58:45.191
Okay.

927
00:58:45.233 --> 00:58:50.155
Jack. are you okay? (laughing)

928
00:58:50.196 --> 00:58:53.324
Oh you laughing at me. huh?

929
00:58:53.366 --> 00:58:54.409
Here. give me a hand up.

930
00:58:54.451 --> 00:58:55.493
No. no!

931
00:58:55.535 --> 00:58:58.246
(splashing)

932
00:58:58.288 --> 00:59:00.874
(light music)

933
00:59:04.210 --> 00:59:06.421
(laughing)

934
01:00:06.189 --> 01:00:07.607
I was in agony.

935
01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:11.027
My life had just been destroyed.

936
01:00:15.782 --> 01:00:18.535
I needed to do
something with the pain.

937
01:00:27.961 --> 01:00:29.212
I just moved to Italy.

938
01:00:31.297 --> 01:00:32.590
My husband told me for years

939
01:00:32.632 --> 01:00:33.800
he didn't want children

940
01:00:35.552 --> 01:00:37.137
until it was too late for me.

941
01:00:42.976 --> 01:00:45.061
Then he got his
secretary pregnant.

942
01:00:49.315 --> 01:00:52.027
So I upped the stakes and
started again out here.

943
01:00:55.488 --> 01:00:59.200
Except. you never
really can start again.

944
01:01:02.162 --> 01:01:02.996
No.

945
01:01:04.664 --> 01:01:05.498
You can't.

946
01:01:09.377 --> 01:01:10.795
Well. Mr. Foster.

947
01:01:10.837 --> 01:01:12.088
Robert. come on.

948
01:01:13.006 --> 01:01:13.840
Robert.

949
01:01:15.842 --> 01:01:17.260
I salute you.

950
01:01:17.302 --> 01:01:19.888
I suspect we're going to
make a comfortable sale here.

951
01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:23.683
Bravo.

952
01:01:29.272 --> 01:01:30.190
Great bones.

953
01:01:33.026 --> 01:01:35.779
(birds chirping)

954
01:01:39.699 --> 01:01:43.078
(electronic dance music)

955
01:01:47.123 --> 01:01:49.918
(man sighing)

956
01:01:49.959 --> 01:01:52.796
(camera clicking)

957
01:01:55.882 --> 01:01:56.966
Yeah yeah yeah.

958
01:01:57.008 --> 01:01:58.718
This is ticking a
lot of boxes for me.

959
01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:00.720
Talk me through the
plumbing situation.

960
01:02:01.888 --> 01:02:02.722
It works.

961
01:02:04.057 --> 01:02:05.600
Pipes in these. too
much can be a bitch.

962
01:02:05.642 --> 01:02:06.851
Southwest facing. huh?

963
01:02:06.893 --> 01:02:08.061
It is.

964
01:02:08.103 --> 01:02:09.270
And the pool gets the
light all day long.

965
01:02:09.312 --> 01:02:10.980
Let's check out these acoustics.

966
01:02:12.315 --> 01:02:14.734
(vocalizing)

967
01:02:20.782 --> 01:02:21.616
Yeah. let's do it.

968
01:02:21.658 --> 01:02:22.450
Do what?

969
01:02:22.492 --> 01:02:24.244
I love it. I love it.

970
01:02:24.285 --> 01:02:26.037
Shouldn't we at least
look at the other places?

971
01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:27.706
Yeah see. that's why I love you.

972
01:02:27.747 --> 01:02:29.541
You keep me grounded.

973
01:02:29.582 --> 01:02:31.626
How many more
places on the list?

974
01:02:31.668 --> 01:02:34.045
Um. three. I believe.

975
01:02:34.087 --> 01:02:37.382
Let's crack on then.
(speaks in foreign language)

976
01:02:37.424 --> 01:02:39.592
(revving)

977
01:02:43.513 --> 01:02:44.431
What a dick.

978
01:02:46.099 --> 01:02:47.976
Still. it looks like
you have a sale.

979
01:02:54.691 --> 01:02:55.942
Did you change your mind?

980
01:02:58.194 --> 01:02:59.446
No. I need to sell it.

981
01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:04.284
Why?

982
01:03:06.161 --> 01:03:06.995
Well.

983
01:03:09.205 --> 01:03:10.373
I should have told you.

984
01:03:16.379 --> 01:03:17.464
I'm getting a divorce.

985
01:03:27.474 --> 01:03:30.185
We've been separated
for a while.

986
01:03:32.645 --> 01:03:33.855
She's taken everything.

987
01:03:35.732 --> 01:03:37.025
(somber music)

988
01:03:37.067 --> 01:03:38.401
I know how that feels.

989
01:03:42.739 --> 01:03:44.991
I managed her parent's
art gallery for her.

990
01:03:46.159 --> 01:03:47.077
That's how we met.

991
01:03:48.495 --> 01:03:49.913
And we were just too young to

992
01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:52.874
you know?

993
01:03:54.584 --> 01:03:56.336
I was really good at that job.

994
01:03:59.047 --> 01:04:01.174
And now they're
selling the place so

995
01:04:02.759 --> 01:04:04.678
I'm gonna use the
money to buy it back.

996
01:04:06.179 --> 01:04:10.809
It's just. I can't follow
in Dad's footsteps.

997
01:04:10.850 --> 01:04:15.855
You know. he's so charming
and easy and talented.

998
01:04:17.691 --> 01:04:19.192
I can't paint like him.

999
01:04:22.195 --> 01:04:24.614
But I can make real
success out of the gallery.

1000
01:04:35.125 --> 01:04:37.544
You want to impress
him. of course.

1001
01:04:44.217 --> 01:04:46.052
He never even came
to the gallery.

1002
01:04:49.389 --> 01:04:50.557
He thinks I'm a failure.

1003
01:04:53.810 --> 01:04:54.644
Really?

1004
01:04:56.229 --> 01:04:57.063
Did you ask him?

1005
01:05:40.315 --> 01:05:42.984
(door creaking)

1006
01:06:17.310 --> 01:06:19.896
(somber music)

1007
01:08:06.086 --> 01:08:07.921
My whole childhood's
in this room.

1008
01:08:11.758 --> 01:08:13.426
I wanted to tell you. but--

1009
01:08:13.468 --> 01:08:14.302
But what?

1010
01:08:17.931 --> 01:08:19.683
I was afraid of how

1011
01:08:20.600 --> 01:08:21.434
you would take it.

1012
01:08:22.852 --> 01:08:25.271
It's like you literally
locked up all of my memories.

1013
01:08:30.944 --> 01:08:33.655
Yes. I think that's
exactly what I did.

1014
01:08:33.697 --> 01:08:34.531
I...

1015
01:08:38.451 --> 01:08:43.123
tried to find the fastest way
for you to be out of pain.

1016
01:08:48.169 --> 01:08:50.005
You never let me in.

1017
01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:55.135
You never fucking let me in!

1018
01:08:57.721 --> 01:08:59.764
You never talked to me!

1019
01:08:59.806 --> 01:09:00.765
Why?

1020
01:09:00.807 --> 01:09:03.601
Why do you never talk to me?!

1021
01:09:03.643 --> 01:09:05.937
Why do you hide this from me?

1022
01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:06.771
No!
Jack.

1023
01:09:06.813 --> 01:09:07.814
Get off me!
Jack.

1024
01:09:07.856 --> 01:09:09.774
Get your hands off me!

1025
01:09:09.816 --> 01:09:10.650
No. no.

1026
01:09:12.986 --> 01:09:13.820
No.

1027
01:09:23.246 --> 01:09:24.080
I'm sorry.

1028
01:09:37.844 --> 01:09:40.180
She had very elegant wrists.

1029
01:09:41.222 --> 01:09:42.182
Do you remember?

1030
01:09:44.517 --> 01:09:45.352
No.

1031
01:09:48.104 --> 01:09:50.273
I don't remember anything.

1032
01:09:54.694 --> 01:09:57.864
When the hospital called
after the car crash.

1033
01:09:59.574 --> 01:10:03.912
there was this Italian
consultant on the line

1034
01:10:03.953 --> 01:10:05.872
trying to explain
what had happened.

1035
01:10:07.374 --> 01:10:10.877
But he was speaking so fast
I thought you were dead.

1036
01:10:12.212 --> 01:10:14.214
And I thought I
had lost you both.

1037
01:10:17.092 --> 01:10:20.387
The despair of finding out
that Raffaella was dead

1038
01:10:20.428 --> 01:10:23.765
and the relief that you weren't.

1039
01:10:24.933 --> 01:10:28.353
you'd think that
those two emotions

1040
01:10:28.395 --> 01:10:30.230
couldn't exist simultaneously.

1041
01:10:32.565 --> 01:10:37.570
But they can.

1042
01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:42.450
Do you think about her much?

1043
01:10:42.492 --> 01:10:44.994
I think about her every day.

1044
01:10:47.914 --> 01:10:49.874
You can't remember

1045
01:10:49.916 --> 01:10:51.459
and I can't forget.

1046
01:10:55.005 --> 01:10:56.673
Just stopped trying in the end.

1047
01:10:59.759 --> 01:11:04.472
Is that weird?

1048
01:11:04.514 --> 01:11:06.391
(laughing) You loved watching

1049
01:11:06.433 --> 01:11:08.143
Italian quiz shows together.

1050
01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:11.730
Did we?

1051
01:11:11.771 --> 01:11:15.567
It was the host's
ridiculous hair.

1052
01:11:15.608 --> 01:11:17.694
You both thought
it was hilarious.

1053
01:11:18.611 --> 01:11:20.655
You'd spend ages in the bath

1054
01:11:20.697 --> 01:11:24.159
making it with
shampoo. (laughing)

1055
01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:26.786
She loved it when you did that.

1056
01:11:33.335 --> 01:11:35.253
I remember she was
really angry with me

1057
01:11:35.295 --> 01:11:36.963
before we got in the car.

1058
01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.092
It's almost my
only memory of her.

1059
01:11:41.134 --> 01:11:45.680
She was shouting at me.

1060
01:11:47.891 --> 01:11:48.892
I don't know why.

1061
01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:58.902
(Robert sobbing)

1062
01:11:59.819 --> 01:12:00.653
Dad?

1063
01:12:01.988 --> 01:12:05.116
Oh fuck. I'm so sorry.

1064
01:12:05.158 --> 01:12:05.992
What?

1065
01:12:10.497 --> 01:12:12.040
I was losing the light.

1066
01:12:14.584 --> 01:12:15.585
What's the matter?

1067
01:12:22.217 --> 01:12:24.719
I was supposed to
be looking after you

1068
01:12:24.761 --> 01:12:25.762
down by the lake.

1069
01:12:27.013 --> 01:12:29.265
You were on your swing
and I was painting.

1070
01:12:31.017 --> 01:12:33.520
The next thing I know Raffie
ran down from the house.

1071
01:12:33.561 --> 01:12:35.730
Someone had called from town.

1072
01:12:35.772 --> 01:12:38.483
You had walked all
the way to your school

1073
01:12:38.525 --> 01:12:40.902
and I hadn't even
noticed you were gone.

1074
01:12:40.944 --> 01:12:42.696
I was so wrapped up painting!

1075
01:12:45.073 --> 01:12:47.117
And I should have
driven to get you.

1076
01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:52.414
But you were losing the light.

1077
01:12:57.377 --> 01:13:00.588
I was supposed to
be in that car!

1078
01:13:00.630 --> 01:13:02.882
Oh God. I'm so sorry. Jack.

1079
01:13:04.592 --> 01:13:06.886
You've lost your mother
and it's my fault!

1080
01:13:10.765 --> 01:13:13.393
(somber music)

1081
01:13:53.975 --> 01:13:55.101
Ruth left me.

1082
01:13:56.603 --> 01:13:57.937
We're getting a divorce.

1083
01:14:03.318 --> 01:14:04.486
Oh. thank God.

1084
01:14:08.114 --> 01:14:09.282
What?

1085
01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:12.535
I've been pretty
sure for months. but.

1086
01:14:13.953 --> 01:14:15.205
(sighing) what a relief.

1087
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:18.416
Wait. you knew?

1088
01:14:18.458 --> 01:14:20.126
What did I always tell you?

1089
01:14:20.168 --> 01:14:21.670
Don't even think about marriage

1090
01:14:21.711 --> 01:14:22.504
until you're

1091
01:14:22.545 --> 01:14:23.380
at least 35.

1092
01:14:25.298 --> 01:14:28.343
We guys don't have a clue
who we are before that.

1093
01:14:28.385 --> 01:14:30.011
Wait. how old were you and Mum

1094
01:14:30.053 --> 01:14:31.513
before you guys got married?

1095
01:14:34.224 --> 01:14:37.310
29. but that was a
different situation.

1096
01:14:39.145 --> 01:14:41.898
(Jack chuckling)

1097
01:14:43.983 --> 01:14:47.862
(bell tolling in distance)

1098
01:14:47.904 --> 01:14:50.407
(light music)

1099
01:15:07.173 --> 01:15:11.553
(Natalia speaks in
foreign language)

1100
01:15:19.853 --> 01:15:22.522
Well. it's your lucky day.

1101
01:15:22.564 --> 01:15:24.190
I'm going full asking.

1102
01:15:24.232 --> 01:15:25.191
Let's close this quick though.

1103
01:15:25.233 --> 01:15:26.484
that's my condition.

1104
01:15:26.526 --> 01:15:27.652
Katie here says that--

1105
01:15:27.694 --> 01:15:29.571
Kate.

1106
01:15:29.612 --> 01:15:30.739
Come again?

1107
01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:35.118
Her name is Kate. not Katie.

1108
01:15:36.036 --> 01:15:38.329
Got you. so Kate says
that works for you.

1109
01:15:38.371 --> 01:15:39.998
Job done. everyone's happy.

1110
01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:41.833
Darling. you know
it's so musty in here.

1111
01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:44.002
Let's make this wall
a glass one. shall we?

1112
01:15:44.044 --> 01:15:45.879
Yeah. yeah that's
a great idea. babe.

1113
01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.380
Obviously this
piece of shit goes.

1114
01:15:47.422 --> 01:15:48.506
Right.

1115
01:15:48.548 --> 01:15:50.425
Looks like Mr. Angry painted it.

1116
01:15:50.467 --> 01:15:53.136
(both laughing)

1117
01:15:54.721 --> 01:15:56.723
You should know that
what I'm about to say

1118
01:15:56.765 --> 01:16:00.101
is not just because of how
dismissive you have been

1119
01:16:00.143 --> 01:16:02.020
of such a beautiful house

1120
01:16:02.062 --> 01:16:04.564
or indeed my craft as a painter.

1121
01:16:05.648 --> 01:16:07.984
Although. let's face
it. that didn't help.

1122
01:16:09.903 --> 01:16:13.698
There is nothing musty
about this space.

1123
01:16:13.740 --> 01:16:16.451
And it wouldn't be improved
by either a glass wall

1124
01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:17.994
or you living in it.

1125
01:16:19.162 --> 01:16:20.830
Sale's off. time to go.

1126
01:16:22.749 --> 01:16:24.209
What I'm trying to say is

1127
01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:25.877
get the fuck out of my house.

1128
01:16:25.919 --> 01:16:27.253
Robert. please.

1129
01:16:28.254 --> 01:16:29.339
Sorry.

1130
01:16:29.381 --> 01:16:31.299
Get the fuck out of
my house. please.

1131
01:16:35.512 --> 01:16:37.305
Very robust language.

1132
01:16:40.141 --> 01:16:41.267
Extremely vigorous.

1133
01:16:42.602 --> 01:16:43.436
Well.

1134
01:16:50.151 --> 01:16:51.111
Fuck 'em.

1135
01:17:02.122 --> 01:17:04.249
What just happened?

1136
01:17:04.290 --> 01:17:06.668
Well you should have
heard the prick.

1137
01:17:06.710 --> 01:17:08.086
I will not sell this house

1138
01:17:08.128 --> 01:17:10.630
to a couple of
culture thugs. Jack.

1139
01:17:10.672 --> 01:17:13.758
That's why we're here.
to sell the house.

1140
01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.344
And you're arguing the
toss over a bloody wall

1141
01:17:16.386 --> 01:17:18.096
you'll never see again.

1142
01:17:18.138 --> 01:17:19.180
Listen. I just thought that--

1143
01:17:19.222 --> 01:17:20.473
You thought what?

1144
01:17:21.307 --> 01:17:24.102
That one conversation
would change everything?

1145
01:17:24.144 --> 01:17:27.188
That I'd suddenly forget
the last 15 years?

1146
01:17:29.524 --> 01:17:30.358
No.

1147
01:17:33.319 --> 01:17:34.529
I can't do it. Jack.

1148
01:17:35.488 --> 01:17:37.323
I just can't give this house up.

1149
01:17:38.158 --> 01:17:40.368
Oh my God. you never
had any intention

1150
01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:42.620
of selling this place.

1151
01:17:42.662 --> 01:17:43.496
Did you?

1152
01:17:54.841 --> 01:17:57.510
(door slamming)

1153
01:18:01.890 --> 01:18:04.517
(somber music)

1154
01:18:21.034 --> 01:18:23.203
(sighing)

1155
01:18:56.152 --> 01:18:58.822
(phone ringing)

1156
01:19:29.102 --> 01:19:31.771
(phone ringing)

1157
01:19:54.461 --> 01:19:57.172
(spoon clinking)

1158
01:20:05.472 --> 01:20:06.848
What's this?

1159
01:20:06.890 --> 01:20:09.392
I made a quick cash
sale on my London house.

1160
01:20:11.144 --> 01:20:12.520
It was worth a lot.

1161
01:20:13.855 --> 01:20:16.858
Enough to buy you out
of your share in Italy.

1162
01:20:22.155 --> 01:20:23.823
Buy your gallery back.

1163
01:20:27.911 --> 01:20:30.080
(sighing)

1164
01:20:30.997 --> 01:20:32.248
Why did you never come?

1165
01:20:33.583 --> 01:20:35.877
Ruth told me you
didn't want me to.

1166
01:20:35.919 --> 01:20:39.547
She said I'd be pressure
you didn't need.

1167
01:20:42.926 --> 01:20:45.178
(scoffing)

1168
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:49.724
Where are you gonna live?

1169
01:20:51.518 --> 01:20:52.894
Italy. I think.

1170
01:20:53.895 --> 01:20:57.023
I'm going to host painting
holidays. would you believe?

1171
01:20:57.065 --> 01:20:58.900
Kate's idea. actually.

1172
01:21:01.903 --> 01:21:06.449
Already got a bit of free
advertising on my app.

1173
01:21:09.869 --> 01:21:11.287
You only have 12 followers.

1174
01:21:12.539 --> 01:21:13.581
Don't knock it.

1175
01:21:13.623 --> 01:21:15.542
You know who else
had 12 followers?

1176
01:21:17.293 --> 01:21:19.963
(Jack laughing)

1177
01:21:34.394 --> 01:21:36.813
Al Notti!

1178
01:21:48.992 --> 01:21:51.578
(somber music)

1179
01:21:58.251 --> 01:22:00.920
(hopeful music)

1180
01:22:19.522 --> 01:22:20.482
That's great.

1181
01:22:20.523 --> 01:22:21.316
And then if we can
add some here as well.

1182
01:22:21.358 --> 01:22:22.233
Yeah that's fine.

1183
01:22:22.275 --> 01:22:23.902
Now. however.

1184
01:22:23.943 --> 01:22:25.487
Sorry. just one moment.

1185
01:22:29.115 --> 01:22:29.949
Ruth.

1186
01:22:36.289 --> 01:22:38.291
I have something for you.

1187
01:22:39.876 --> 01:22:41.252
Look. even if you
did win the lottery.

1188
01:22:41.294 --> 01:22:42.629
we're not selling anymore.

1189
01:22:45.632 --> 01:22:47.592
No. I'm serious. I
won't accept any offer.

1190
01:22:47.634 --> 01:22:48.843
You'll accept this.

1191
01:22:57.143 --> 01:22:59.145
I should have signed
it a long time ago.

1192
01:23:10.156 --> 01:23:11.491
Good luck with everything.

1193
01:23:26.214 --> 01:23:29.050
(uplifting music)

1194
01:23:33.179 --> 01:23:35.890
(birds chirping)

1195
01:23:47.068 --> 01:23:50.780
Try for a touch more
contrast there. Susan.

1196
01:23:51.948 --> 01:23:53.700
Maybe the banana wants to be

1197
01:23:53.742 --> 01:23:55.744
a little less green?

1198
01:23:55.785 --> 01:23:58.455
I was aiming for
a jungly malaise.

1199
01:24:03.918 --> 01:24:06.129
Excellent artistic intention.

1200
01:24:14.554 --> 01:24:15.388
Oh.

1201
01:24:16.973 --> 01:24:18.975
I was inspired by your wall.

1202
01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:21.728
But I thought you.

1203
01:24:23.229 --> 01:24:24.773
It's grown on me.

1204
01:24:40.246 --> 01:24:42.332
Excuse me for a moment.

1205
01:24:51.758 --> 01:24:54.928
It turns out it was
never about the money.

1206
01:24:59.099 --> 01:25:00.100
But I want a father.

1207
01:25:14.531 --> 01:25:17.283
(birds chirping)

1208
01:25:18.993 --> 01:25:22.580
Why didn't you call me?

1209
01:25:22.622 --> 01:25:23.957
I came to see you.

1210
01:25:27.293 --> 01:25:28.628
You were with your husband and

1211
01:25:28.670 --> 01:25:31.381
you looked together.

1212
01:25:32.966 --> 01:25:35.301
He's the father of my daughter.

1213
01:25:35.343 --> 01:25:36.636
I have to keep the peace.

1214
01:25:45.061 --> 01:25:45.895
Okay well.

1215
01:25:49.733 --> 01:25:50.650
what do we do now?

1216
01:25:53.737 --> 01:25:54.654
We start again.

1217
01:25:55.989 --> 01:25:56.906
From the beginning.

1218
01:25:58.033 --> 01:25:58.867
You go.

1219
01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:01.119
Oh you mean now?

1220
01:26:01.161 --> 01:26:02.287
Mhmm.

1221
01:26:02.328 --> 01:26:03.830
Okay. I'm Jack.

1222
01:26:04.873 --> 01:26:06.624
Hi. Natalia. nice to meet you.

1223
01:26:06.666 --> 01:26:08.501
I'm a hundred percent single.

1224
01:26:08.543 --> 01:26:10.378
This is great news.

1225
01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:11.629
I have no job.

1226
01:26:11.671 --> 01:26:14.549
This is terrible news.
goodbye. (laughing)

1227
01:26:17.719 --> 01:26:18.678
Okay. your turn.

1228
01:26:19.679 --> 01:26:20.513
Oh.

1229
01:26:22.223 --> 01:26:24.392
(sighing)

1230
01:26:29.064 --> 01:26:29.898
Great mother.

1231
01:26:33.568 --> 01:26:34.778
That girl is my heart.

1232
01:26:36.071 --> 01:26:36.905
I know.

1233
01:26:40.033 --> 01:26:40.867
I know.

1234
01:26:48.375 --> 01:26:50.877
I painted her about a
thousand different ways

1235
01:26:52.879 --> 01:26:54.464
and barely scratched
the surface.

1236
01:26:58.426 --> 01:26:59.594
This one's not bad.

1237
01:27:09.062 --> 01:27:10.939
I'd put it on the main wall.

1238
01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:12.399
Which main wall?

1239
01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:15.110
Kate's showing me a gallery
space in town tomorrow.

1240
01:27:16.236 --> 01:27:19.406
I'm thinking of this
artist called Robert Foster

1241
01:27:19.447 --> 01:27:21.199
for my first exhibition.

1242
01:27:21.241 --> 01:27:22.742
You know him?

1243
01:27:22.784 --> 01:27:24.202
Uh huh.

1244
01:27:24.244 --> 01:27:25.078
That guy?

1245
01:27:26.246 --> 01:27:29.082
Very rare to see any
of his later work.

1246
01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.918
Although I hear he's
quite busy again.

1247
01:27:32.752 --> 01:27:34.671
I heard that whisper.

1248
01:27:35.588 --> 01:27:38.091
(light music)

1249
01:27:39.259 --> 01:27:43.013
(singing in foreign language)

1250
01:28:40.820 --> 01:28:43.990
(light-hearted music)

1251
01:29:47.387 --> 01:29:49.889
(light music)
