6
00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:51.133
I'm trying to surpass
the Burj Khalifa

7
00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:53.200
as world's tallest structure.

8
00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:58.166
The bride wanted seven tears
for her lucky prime number.

9
00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.633
Maybe we will get
lucky this weekend

10
00:00:59.767 --> 00:01:01.700
and meet a couple
millionaires of our own.

11
00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.100
I feel like I'm going to be
piping champagne buttercream

12
00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:07.867
in my sleep tonight.

13
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.867
Well. you're optimistic.

14
00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.200
What sleep?

15
00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:11.767
Hmm.

16
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.033
Is this side an eighth of an
inch shorter than this side?

17
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.100
Okay. is this because you are
catering the society wedding

18
00:01:20.233 --> 00:01:21.767
of the decade or because
it's Jess's wedding?

19
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.767
Both.

20
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.767
And no particular order.

21
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.200
Admit it.

22
00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:26.533
You just want Justin
to eat her words

23
00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:28.700
about your little business.

24
00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:29.700
Is that so wrong?

25
00:01:29.834 --> 00:01:31.633
Did I hear my name?

26
00:01:33.834 --> 00:01:37.767
Oh. Goldy your
cake. it's stunning.

27
00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.200
Well. it's not done.
but thank you so much.

28
00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.033
What are you
talking about. mother?

29
00:01:43.166 --> 00:01:45.867
Those are macadamia
nuts on my wedding cake.

30
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.934
I told Goldy a thousand times.

31
00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:50.867
Sterling's allergic
to tree nuts.

32
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.600
And is that a Juliet rose I see?

33
00:01:54.734 --> 00:01:56.033
You know that Romeo
and Juliet's love

34
00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:59.367
went from epic to tragic
almost overnight. right?

35
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.934
Why don't just break
a mirror on my cake?

36
00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:03.266
Jess. Jess...

37
00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.767
- Well--
- Well.

38
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:14.266
we can replace the Juliet
rose with a. um. um...

39
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.333
A Paeonia lactiflora.

40
00:02:17.467 --> 00:02:19.834
A peony. those stand for
love and good fortune.

41
00:02:19.967 --> 00:02:21.600
Love and good fortune.

42
00:02:21.734 --> 00:02:22.767
Good.

43
00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.333
And also they
aren't macadamia nuts.

44
00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:28.433
They are pure Madagascar
white chocolate.

45
00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:31.433
There is not a nut in sight.

46
00:02:31.567 --> 00:02:34.934
Except for the
one in front of us.

47
00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:36.033
Mm.

48
00:02:37.967 --> 00:02:40.000
Still. get rid of them.

49
00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:41.500
Pearls of any sort

50
00:02:41.633 --> 00:02:44.333
represent future tears and
heartache in a marriage.

51
00:02:44.467 --> 00:02:46.100
Do I have to
micromanage everything?

52
00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:47.567
Let's go. mother.

53
00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:50.600
Thank you.

54
00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.934
Well. as expected. she
is the ultimate bridezilla.

55
00:02:56.066 --> 00:02:57.500
And she is also our client.

56
00:02:57.633 --> 00:02:59.266
And nothing is gonna stop
us from putting on the most

57
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.834
memorable rehearsal dinner.

58
00:03:00.967 --> 00:03:03.500
and wedding reception
Elk Park has ever seen.

59
00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:05.667
even if it kills us.

60
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.333
Now. let's go find some peonies.

61
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.333
Hey.

62
00:03:27.467 --> 00:03:29.734
Is that him. is that the guy?

63
00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:31.734
Mom. boundaries.

64
00:03:31.867 --> 00:03:33.000
He's cute.

65
00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:36.233
Mom. that is so (indistinct)!

66
00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:38.934
My baby has our first crush.

67
00:03:49.133 --> 00:03:50.100
Hunter.

68
00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:57.166
What's up man?

69
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.800
Sterling Bridgewater
finally came back to Elk Park.

70
00:04:01.934 --> 00:04:03.400
Golden Berry.

71
00:04:03.533 --> 00:04:05.400
Oh. I haven't
been called that a forever.

72
00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:06.633
You haven't aged a day.

73
00:04:06.767 --> 00:04:08.400
Oh. and you're
still the charmer.

74
00:04:08.533 --> 00:04:10.066
Apparently not
charming enough.

75
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.300
Let's just say not
everyone has given me

76
00:04:11.433 --> 00:04:12.734
as warm a welcome.

77
00:04:12.867 --> 00:04:15.133
Well. you and Hunter
are gonna be family now.

78
00:04:15.266 --> 00:04:16.800
so you're just gonna
have to play nice.

79
00:04:16.934 --> 00:04:19.066
I always play nice.

80
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.400
Even if my future
brother-in-law doesn't.

81
00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:23.633
That is Elk Park for you.

82
00:04:28.367 --> 00:04:30.734
Yes more. more ladies. more.

83
00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:32.900
Big smiles. ladies.

84
00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:34.166
All together.

85
00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:36.300
She does light up
a room. doesn't she?

86
00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:37.467
I mean...

87
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.900
- Excuse me.
- Yes. of course.

88
00:04:42.033 --> 00:04:42.900
Ladies.

89
00:04:48.266 --> 00:04:52.233
Pinch me. am I dreaming or
is this actually happening?

90
00:04:52.367 --> 00:04:53.734
Ah!

91
00:04:53.867 --> 00:04:56.467
For a delicate flower. you
are stronger than you look.

92
00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.800
It's all the espresso.

93
00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:00.700
Goldy and Marla. you guys.

94
00:05:00.834 --> 00:05:01.967
It's been forever.

95
00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.967
Katie!

96
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.533
I thought that
was you out there.

97
00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:07.967
So you're a bridesmaid

98
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.333
Maid of honor. actually.

99
00:05:09.467 --> 00:05:10.433
Wow.

100
00:05:11.633 --> 00:05:12.700
I guess I didn't realize that
you and Jess were friends

101
00:05:12.834 --> 00:05:14.033
in high school.

102
00:05:14.166 --> 00:05:15.567
Yeah. we kept in
touch even though

103
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.967
we went to different state
colleges. but we're BFFs now.

104
00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:19.300
Crazy. right?

105
00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:20.300
Well.
you look great.

106
00:05:20.433 --> 00:05:21.300
How are you?

107
00:05:21.433 --> 00:05:22.367
Never better.

108
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.800
- Here you go. babes.
- Oh. thanks hon.

109
00:05:23.934 --> 00:05:26.133
Goldy. Marla. this
is my boyfriend Ray.

110
00:05:26.266 --> 00:05:28.133
and Sterling's best man.

111
00:05:28.266 --> 00:05:29.800
These are my old
high school friends.

112
00:05:29.934 --> 00:05:31.633
Minus the old part.

113
00:05:32.767 --> 00:05:35.200
So did you guys
meet in San Francisco?

114
00:05:35.333 --> 00:05:36.800
Born and raised.

115
00:05:36.934 --> 00:05:39.166
I was classmates from Sterling
in college and Katie had just

116
00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.200
broken poor Sterling's heart.

117
00:05:40.333 --> 00:05:41.200
Oh. please.

118
00:05:41.333 --> 00:05:42.533
You love that you got the girl.

119
00:05:42.667 --> 00:05:43.800
Guilty.

120
00:05:43.934 --> 00:05:45.533
I'm a lucky man.

121
00:05:45.667 --> 00:05:48.200
And is that when
Jess and Sterling

122
00:05:48.333 --> 00:05:49.533
started seeing each other?

123
00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:51.300
No. that was way after that.

124
00:05:51.433 --> 00:05:53.200
They reconnected at one of our
house parties. right babes?

125
00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:55.700
Yeah. yeah. just after
she and Tom got divorced.

126
00:05:55.834 --> 00:05:58.367
She'd been living in
San Francisco for a
few years by then

127
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.700
and we were hanging out.

128
00:06:00.834 --> 00:06:02.200
Ray and I invited her over.

129
00:06:02.333 --> 00:06:06.033
She and Sterling
reconnected and here we are.

130
00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:07.533
Hey Ray.

131
00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:11.533
Sorry ladies. there's a
30 year single malt calling.

132
00:06:11.667 --> 00:06:12.767
Nice to meet you.

133
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:14.600
Nice to meet you.

134
00:06:14.734 --> 00:06:16.266
Hey. let's all grab lunch
after the wedding to catch up.

135
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.700
That would be great.

136
00:06:17.834 --> 00:06:19.934
- Yeah!
- Have fun!

137
00:06:20.066 --> 00:06:21.934
Ah. what a cute couple.

138
00:06:22.066 --> 00:06:24.867
Don't you hate being
single at these things?

139
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.533
You'll always be my plus one.

140
00:06:28.734 --> 00:06:30.433
Man.
these are so good.

141
00:06:30.567 --> 00:06:32.934
You're liking
those. aren't you?

142
00:06:33.066 --> 00:06:34.533
I'm loving the parsley chips.

143
00:06:34.667 --> 00:06:35.533
She's perfect.

144
00:06:35.667 --> 00:06:36.767
Oh. thank you.

145
00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.767
Thank you so much. it's
such a beautiful spread.

146
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:39.867
Oh. you're welcome.

147
00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.867
Don't you think. Laurence?

148
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.100
Oh. yes. yes.

149
00:06:42.233 --> 00:06:43.600
Nothing too good
for your daughter.

150
00:06:43.734 --> 00:06:46.100
Loving these beef sliders.

151
00:06:46.233 --> 00:06:48.100
Actually. they're bison.

152
00:06:48.233 --> 00:06:49.100
Bison.

153
00:06:49.233 --> 00:06:51.433
Per the bride's request.

154
00:06:51.567 --> 00:06:54.533
Of course they are. Well. I
better grab a couple of more.

155
00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:55.533
Get my money's worth.

156
00:06:55.667 --> 00:06:57.033
There you go.

157
00:06:57.166 --> 00:07:01.166
He's
accepted Jess as his own.

158
00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.934
She looks so happy. doesn't she?

159
00:07:05.567 --> 00:07:07.600
With her band of besties.

160
00:07:10.133 --> 00:07:11.533
Well. I think it's really nice

161
00:07:11.667 --> 00:07:15.934
that so many people have found
love a second time around.

162
00:07:16.066 --> 00:07:17.834
Can I get a scotch. neat?

163
00:07:17.967 --> 00:07:19.500
Chester. taking a break from

164
00:07:19.633 --> 00:07:21.433
all that wheeling and dealing.

165
00:07:21.567 --> 00:07:22.934
Work can wait.

166
00:07:23.066 --> 00:07:24.633
Tonight is all
about sporting Jess.

167
00:07:24.767 --> 00:07:25.767
Right.

168
00:07:27.734 --> 00:07:31.600
Doubt it all you want. Jess
and I make solid partners.

169
00:07:31.734 --> 00:07:33.433
We've got big goals
for Whitetail.

170
00:07:33.567 --> 00:07:35.934
I don't doubt
Jess's sincerity.

171
00:07:36.066 --> 00:07:37.600
I doubt yours.

172
00:07:37.734 --> 00:07:39.100
While she's distracted
planning this wedding.

173
00:07:39.233 --> 00:07:42.934
you're quietly trying to
poach her high end clients.

174
00:07:43.066 --> 00:07:44.433
What you talking about?

175
00:07:44.567 --> 00:07:46.433
I'm onto you.

176
00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:50.100
And as soon as this wedding's
over. Jess will be too.

177
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:03.567
Man. this is busing.

178
00:08:09.033 --> 00:08:11.834
Oh. I
gotta talk to Tommy.

179
00:08:11.967 --> 00:08:12.967
Hey Katie.

180
00:08:14.033 --> 00:08:14.900
Well. hello.

181
00:08:15.033 --> 00:08:16.400
Hello. hello.

182
00:08:16.533 --> 00:08:17.400
So good to see you.

183
00:08:17.533 --> 00:08:18.400
You too. You too.

184
00:08:18.533 --> 00:08:19.433
- Have a seat.
- You look great.

185
00:08:19.567 --> 00:08:21.333
Thank you.

186
00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:22.667
I really appreciate
you coming. Tommy.

187
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.967
Well. I
appreciate the invite.

188
00:08:27.867 --> 00:08:30.467
Take a picture mom.
it'll last longer.

189
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.600
What?

190
00:08:33.033 --> 00:08:34.834
No. see. I was. I was.
you see back there?

191
00:08:34.967 --> 00:08:37.667
I was just trying to make
sure that the waiter was.

192
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.233
you know. doing the thing.

193
00:08:40.367 --> 00:08:41.233
Uh-huh.

194
00:08:41.367 --> 00:08:42.400
Anyway.

195
00:08:42.533 --> 00:08:44.333
Um. I'm headed to
Charlotte's house.

196
00:08:44.467 --> 00:08:45.400
Her mom's here.

197
00:08:45.533 --> 00:08:46.400
Oh. okay.

198
00:08:46.533 --> 00:08:47.500
I love you.

199
00:08:48.967 --> 00:08:50.166
Text me when you
get there. okay?

200
00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.500
Tell Charlotte's mom.
I said thank you.

201
00:08:51.633 --> 00:08:52.500
Okay.

202
00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.900
Oh. shoot. man!

203
00:09:01.867 --> 00:09:03.734
That's expensive.

204
00:09:03.867 --> 00:09:06.567
If looks could kill.

205
00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:07.600
It's a far cry
from city hall. huh?

206
00:09:07.734 --> 00:09:08.633
Oh. come on.

207
00:09:08.767 --> 00:09:09.633
City hall worked.

208
00:09:09.767 --> 00:09:10.633
Worked?

209
00:09:10.767 --> 00:09:12.400
No. it didn't. we're divorced.

210
00:09:12.533 --> 00:09:14.900
Anyway. water under
the bridge now.

211
00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:17.400
This time I'm doing it right.

212
00:09:18.433 --> 00:09:19.400
I hope he makes you happy.

213
00:09:19.533 --> 00:09:22.700
I hope the same
for you too one day.

214
00:09:25.767 --> 00:09:26.900
Congratulations.

215
00:09:27.033 --> 00:09:28.000
Excuse me.

216
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.567
Am I loud in here?

217
00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.567
It's my kitchen.

218
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.233
You can be here anywhere I am.

219
00:09:38.367 --> 00:09:39.800
Well. you did it again.

220
00:09:39.934 --> 00:09:41.066
Oh.

221
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.233
And to put a smile
on Jess's face.

222
00:09:44.367 --> 00:09:45.400
That's not easy.

223
00:09:45.533 --> 00:09:49.300
She
wasn't that bad.

224
00:09:49.433 --> 00:09:52.133
You know. it was um. fun.

225
00:09:52.266 --> 00:09:53.633
You're a terrible liar.

226
00:09:53.767 --> 00:09:55.233
I know.

227
00:09:55.367 --> 00:09:56.567
This is why I'm the chef and
you're the detective. right?

228
00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.233
Oh. I'm off duty tonight.

229
00:09:58.367 --> 00:09:59.633
Is a cop ever off duty?

230
00:09:59.767 --> 00:10:01.133
Stick around. you'll find out.

231
00:10:01.266 --> 00:10:04.133
Mm. but can you
handle the heat?

232
00:10:04.266 --> 00:10:05.900
Try one.

233
00:10:06.033 --> 00:10:10.900
- The heat?
- Yeah.

234
00:10:11.033 --> 00:10:16.233
- Child's play.
- Mm-hmm.

235
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.000
See now this is fun.

236
00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:27.800
Hey.

237
00:10:27.934 --> 00:10:28.900
Is that him?

238
00:10:29.033 --> 00:10:31.400
The famous detective?

239
00:10:31.533 --> 00:10:34.233
You're drunk and
soaked in champagne.

240
00:10:34.367 --> 00:10:35.967
I'm so celebrating.

241
00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:40.800
I'm getting married to the most
gorgeous bride in Elk Park.

242
00:10:40.934 --> 00:10:44.233
Yeah. you are.

243
00:10:44.367 --> 00:10:46.800
Do they look like
a couple to you?

244
00:10:46.934 --> 00:10:48.333
Does it matter?

245
00:10:49.367 --> 00:10:50.567
Look at you now. honey.

246
00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:53.066
I'd say you upgraded.

247
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.233
Ooh.

248
00:10:55.367 --> 00:10:56.233
Oh. easy.

249
00:10:56.367 --> 00:10:57.233
What?

250
00:10:57.367 --> 00:10:58.233
You're drunk.

251
00:10:58.367 --> 00:10:59.400
Take a walk. get some coffee.

252
00:10:59.533 --> 00:11:01.900
- You know I'm--
- Thank you.

253
00:11:10.266 --> 00:11:11.467
- Hey.
- Hi.

254
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:12.533
You leaving?

255
00:11:12.667 --> 00:11:13.800
- I had fun.
- You did?

256
00:11:13.934 --> 00:11:15.767
I did have fun. yep.

257
00:11:17.333 --> 00:11:22.467
So my fiance is upset
at me for some reason.

258
00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:27.867
Katie. how about you
and I grab a drink

259
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.300
fr old times sake. huh?

260
00:11:30.433 --> 00:11:32.867
Maybe you and I could
give it another go.

261
00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:34.867
Ray!

262
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.367
I'm just. I'm kidding.

263
00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:37.967
Lighten up.
- Oh!

264
00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.467
Lighten up. is this
a party or a funeral?

265
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.867
Leave my girlfriend out of it.

266
00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:43.867
I'm gonna need
you to handle that.

267
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.967
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

268
00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:46.967
I was just joking.

269
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:47.967
Come on. man.

270
00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:49.367
I'm getting married tomorrow.

271
00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.367
Yeah. well. some
things aren't funny. man.

272
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.467
You know what's not funny?

273
00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.033
You ruined my watch.

274
00:11:55.166 --> 00:11:57.467
You don't see me complaining
about that. okay.

275
00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.467
Oh yeah. as you keep
telling us it's a Rolex.

276
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.867
Well. what's the little
champagne gonna do?

277
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:01.867
You know what?

278
00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.200
I think you've had enough.

279
00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:04.433
No. I think it's
past your bedtime.

280
00:12:04.567 --> 00:12:05.700
Okay. well. maybe
if you hadn't spilled

281
00:12:05.834 --> 00:12:07.266
all my dad's champagne
on your watch.

282
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.433
you'd still have a
functioning Rolex.

283
00:12:08.567 --> 00:12:09.500
What's your problem?

284
00:12:09.633 --> 00:12:10.500
With you?

285
00:12:10.633 --> 00:12:11.867
I don't know.

286
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.033
You're entitled. spoiled.
narcissistic. can't dress.

287
00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:16.433
Oh. big words
from a little man.

288
00:12:16.567 --> 00:12:17.934
You know what?

289
00:12:18.066 --> 00:12:19.533
Maybe you should sell some
more of your daddy's flawed

290
00:12:19.667 --> 00:12:21.467
software to the town.

291
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.600
that he can buy you a
new Rolex. huh. big guy?

292
00:12:24.734 --> 00:12:27.200
- Watch your mouth.
- Hey. hey. hey. hey.

293
00:12:27.333 --> 00:12:28.633
Knock it off.

294
00:12:31.166 --> 00:12:32.333
Think of Jess.

295
00:12:36.233 --> 00:12:38.100
Don't tell me
to think of Jess.

296
00:12:39.667 --> 00:12:40.700
Relax. all right?

297
00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.867
Hey. hey.

298
00:12:46.567 --> 00:12:49.200
Go home and sleep it off.

299
00:12:49.333 --> 00:12:51.333
You don't wanna do this.

300
00:13:02.567 --> 00:13:05.667
Ugh. let's go
make some coffee.

301
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:10.667
500 unlucky white chocolate
pearls need to be refashioned.

302
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:12.000
Hey. come with me.

303
00:13:12.133 --> 00:13:13.100
I'll get you some ice.

304
00:13:13.233 --> 00:13:14.166
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

305
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:16.500
Should have gone home earlier.

306
00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.100
- Gold.
- Hmm?

307
00:13:25.233 --> 00:13:27.000
Have you seen Sterling?

308
00:13:27.133 --> 00:13:29.767
He's gone and not
answering his phone.

309
00:13:56.567 --> 00:13:58.433
Hey. Quinn.

310
00:13:58.567 --> 00:14:00.667
I need you to stay back.

311
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:01.834
Detective?

312
00:14:03.967 --> 00:14:05.000
Where's Jess?

313
00:14:05.133 --> 00:14:06.233
We can't find her.

314
00:14:06.367 --> 00:14:08.233
but I notified next of
kin. Sterling's parents.

315
00:14:08.367 --> 00:14:09.834
Send a squad car to her hotel.

316
00:14:09.967 --> 00:14:12.233
We need to find her right now.
Mason. I'll call Jess's mom.

317
00:14:12.367 --> 00:14:13.233
Okay.

318
00:14:13.367 --> 00:14:14.533
Goldy and Marla are upstairs.

319
00:14:14.667 --> 00:14:15.667
Okay.

320
00:14:22.467 --> 00:14:23.400
Hey ladies.

321
00:14:23.533 --> 00:14:24.467
Hey.

322
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.600
Okay?

323
00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.667
You know where Jess is?

324
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.767
No.

325
00:14:31.667 --> 00:14:32.567
I hope she's okay.

326
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:33.834
Detective?

327
00:14:33.967 --> 00:14:35.000
- Yes?
- Yes.

328
00:14:36.133 --> 00:14:38.667
Uh. sorry boss.

329
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:39.900
What you got?

330
00:14:40.033 --> 00:14:41.166
Nothing conclusive.

331
00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:42.500
but looks like
blunt force trauma

332
00:14:42.633 --> 00:14:44.166
to his right temporal region.

333
00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:45.834
I won't know more
until I do the autopsy.

334
00:14:45.967 --> 00:14:47.367
TOD?

335
00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.500
I'd estimate time of death
within the last few hours.

336
00:14:50.633 --> 00:14:52.166
What's this?

337
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.734
Some sort of
rash. forensic swab.

338
00:14:54.867 --> 00:14:57.166
Strange that it's
only on his right hand.

339
00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.400
Yeah.

340
00:14:58.533 --> 00:14:59.567
Did you find a cell phone?

341
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.066
They're searching
the perimeter.

342
00:15:09.266 --> 00:15:10.900
Impact blood spatter.

343
00:15:11.033 --> 00:15:12.900
What you thinking. boss?

344
00:15:13.033 --> 00:15:18.734
I don't know. detective.
what do you think I'm thinking?

345
00:15:18.867 --> 00:15:20.300
You want me to...

346
00:15:20.433 --> 00:15:24.400
Um. medium velocity
forward spatter.

347
00:15:24.533 --> 00:15:26.567
If the victim died from
blunt force trauma.

348
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:28.233
this may be our murder weapon.

349
00:15:28.367 --> 00:15:29.367
Very good.

350
00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:31.900
Yes!

351
00:15:32.033 --> 00:15:34.467
If it was foul play. don't
jump to any conclusions.

352
00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.467
You still need to get
statements. DNA swabs.

353
00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.066
and fingerprints.

354
00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:43.233
Okay.

355
00:15:43.367 --> 00:15:46.233
Ray. this is Detective Kildea.

356
00:15:46.367 --> 00:15:47.967
Mason.

357
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.400
Ah!

358
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.633
You okay?

359
00:15:52.767 --> 00:15:53.967
Yeah.

360
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:55.734
Well. can I have a seat. Ray?

361
00:15:55.867 --> 00:15:56.867
Sure.

362
00:16:00.934 --> 00:16:05.633
So when was the last
time you saw Sterling?

363
00:16:05.767 --> 00:16:08.467
This morning. around 9:00.

364
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.467
He stepped outside
for a few minutes.

365
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.800
but he never came back.

366
00:16:13.934 --> 00:16:15.867
Did he say he was
meeting with anybody?

367
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.467
No. we were ready
to go to the church.

368
00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:21.800
I tried texting and calling.
but he never responded.

369
00:16:21.934 --> 00:16:23.867
Have you seen or
heard from Jess?

370
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.800
No. not since last night.

371
00:16:26.934 --> 00:16:29.033
I was in the kitchen all
morning prepping hors d'oeuvres.

372
00:16:29.166 --> 00:16:31.800
Nothing was off on my end.

373
00:16:31.934 --> 00:16:33.867
Well. from my end.
something was off.

374
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.533
I passed through the lobby and
that's when I found Sterling

375
00:16:37.667 --> 00:16:38.700
and we checked for a pulse.

376
00:16:38.834 --> 00:16:41.800
We tried CPR.
but nothing worked.

377
00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:44.800
What time was that?

378
00:16:44.934 --> 00:16:45.800
10:30.

379
00:16:45.934 --> 00:16:46.867
Were the doors locked?

380
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.133
Yes.

381
00:16:48.266 --> 00:16:49.800
No. Goldy had
already opened them.

382
00:16:49.934 --> 00:16:51.633
Deliveries were
coming in and out.

383
00:16:51.767 --> 00:16:53.300
I'll need a list
of those vendors.

384
00:16:53.433 --> 00:16:55.967
What was Sterling's mood
like the last time you saw him?

385
00:16:56.100 --> 00:16:57.700
Combative.

386
00:16:57.834 --> 00:17:00.200
He was in a great mood.

387
00:17:00.333 --> 00:17:01.867
He wasn't in a great mood.

388
00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.100
How'd you get that black eye?

389
00:17:04.233 --> 00:17:05.533
I tripped and fell.

390
00:17:05.667 --> 00:17:08.000
Hit my face right on a doorknob.

391
00:17:08.133 --> 00:17:09.133
Uh-huh.

392
00:17:10.333 --> 00:17:12.033
Did Sterling have any enemies?

393
00:17:12.166 --> 00:17:13.266
Everyone loved Sterling.

394
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.533
Everyone hated Sterling.

395
00:17:14.667 --> 00:17:15.867
I liked Sterling.

396
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.767
Anne didn't like Sterling.

397
00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:21.200
Call if you remember
anything else.

398
00:17:21.333 --> 00:17:22.433
Is it just me or
are these people

399
00:17:22.567 --> 00:17:24.767
contradicting each other?

400
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.033
Eyewitness testimonies are
like slogging through mud.

401
00:17:27.166 --> 00:17:30.500
but somewhere in
between lies the truth.

402
00:17:31.667 --> 00:17:33.700
Boss. they found
Sterling's cell

403
00:17:33.834 --> 00:17:35.367
a hundred yards from here.

404
00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:37.934
Jessamyn purse. key
fob and car keys

405
00:17:38.066 --> 00:17:39.533
were at her hotel room
with signs of a struggle.

406
00:17:41.834 --> 00:17:43.700
No cell phone. no Jess.

407
00:17:44.834 --> 00:17:47.934
Tell them to seal
off Jess's hotel room.

408
00:17:48.066 --> 00:17:49.367
Nobody goes in.

409
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.934
Hey.

410
00:18:29.066 --> 00:18:30.500
Thank goodness you're here.

411
00:18:30.633 --> 00:18:31.834
Jess is missing.
what is going on?

412
00:18:31.967 --> 00:18:33.266
We're gonna find her

413
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.600
Is. it true. is
Sterling really dead?

414
00:18:39.066 --> 00:18:42.100
I'm afraid so. yes.

415
00:18:42.233 --> 00:18:45.433
Who would wanna do this to
Sterling and. and Jessamyn?

416
00:18:45.567 --> 00:18:46.700
I. I don't...

417
00:18:47.734 --> 00:18:49.433
When did you last see Jess?

418
00:18:49.567 --> 00:18:50.934
This. this morning.

419
00:18:51.066 --> 00:18:53.166
We were all taking photos
and. and drinking mimosas.

420
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.100
She said she needed a
moment and wanted us

421
00:18:56.233 --> 00:18:59.767
all out of her hotel room.
so we. we gave her space.

422
00:18:59.900 --> 00:19:01.900
You know how she
gets sometimes.

423
00:19:02.033 --> 00:19:03.166
What time is that?

424
00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:05.400
I don't know.
eight-ish. maybe.

425
00:19:05.533 --> 00:19:06.667
I mean. I started
getting worried

426
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:07.734
because when it
was time to leave.

427
00:19:07.867 --> 00:19:09.166
she wasn't answering her calls.

428
00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:10.900
Yeah. Ann stayed here
and I. I drove around

429
00:19:11.033 --> 00:19:13.000
looking for her.
- Okay.

430
00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:15.834
Where's Laurence.

431
00:19:15.967 --> 00:19:19.000
He went home earlier.
he wasn't feeling well.

432
00:19:19.133 --> 00:19:21.066
Is there some place
Jessamyn could have gone?

433
00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.200
She wasn't getting
cold feet. was she?

434
00:19:22.333 --> 00:19:23.333
No.

435
00:19:24.367 --> 00:19:26.233
She loves Sterling.

436
00:19:26.367 --> 00:19:30.400
I mean. Jess has
been known to take off.

437
00:19:30.533 --> 00:19:32.000
Remember Bali?

438
00:19:32.133 --> 00:19:33.266
I mean. she went there for two
weeks without telling anyone.

439
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.333
- No. no. no.
- Just because.

440
00:19:34.467 --> 00:19:36.500
This is different.

441
00:19:36.633 --> 00:19:38.600
This is her wedding day.

442
00:19:40.133 --> 00:19:42.567
Laurence...

443
00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:43.834
What about Jess. any news?

444
00:19:43.967 --> 00:19:45.033
No.

445
00:19:45.166 --> 00:19:46.900
We have to treat Jess
as a missing person.

446
00:19:47.033 --> 00:19:50.000
Oh!

447
00:19:57.867 --> 00:19:59.400
What is it?

448
00:19:59.533 --> 00:20:01.333
Find something?

449
00:20:01.467 --> 00:20:04.333
How do they fold the
towel to look like a swan?

450
00:20:04.467 --> 00:20:05.333
Doesn't make sense.

451
00:20:05.467 --> 00:20:06.767
Mason. focus.

452
00:20:09.133 --> 00:20:13.266
Sorry. crime scene.

453
00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:19.500
Money and credit cards intact.

454
00:20:19.633 --> 00:20:21.500
It's definitely not a robbery.

455
00:20:21.633 --> 00:20:23.667
Boss. do you think
it's possible...

456
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.066
I'm not saying your ex is a
cold-blooded killer or anything.

457
00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:30.066
but could Chessman have
done it and skipped town?

458
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.166
Not a chance.

459
00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:36.166
She'd never have left
that Chanel purse behind.

460
00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:40.333
There's only
one candle holder.

461
00:20:40.467 --> 00:20:42.066
Its pair's missing.

462
00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.333
Oh. let's keep her eyes
peeled for the other one.

463
00:20:43.467 --> 00:20:46.900
What else is off in
Miss Cole's room?

464
00:20:47.033 --> 00:20:49.333
Oh. it's messy for a lady.

465
00:20:52.133 --> 00:20:53.233
You don't know Jessamyn.

466
00:20:53.367 --> 00:20:56.066
Aside from that. her
clothes are all here.

467
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.667
but there's no suitcase.

468
00:21:06.367 --> 00:21:07.734
Hi. Welcome.

469
00:21:07.867 --> 00:21:09.467
How you doing?

470
00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.967
I don't. I don't get it.

471
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:13.800
Is this a floral shop
or a coffee shop?

472
00:21:13.934 --> 00:21:14.900
It's both.

473
00:21:15.934 --> 00:21:16.967
Both.

474
00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:18.100
Do you sell tires
and mosquitoes too?

475
00:21:18.233 --> 00:21:19.133
No.

476
00:21:19.266 --> 00:21:20.300
But you can find an abundance

477
00:21:20.433 --> 00:21:23.033
of sass. spunk and shell shock.

478
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.900
Sorry. it's been a
long and trying day.

479
00:21:28.033 --> 00:21:29.400
What can I get you?

480
00:21:29.533 --> 00:21:32.033
Just a black coffee. thanks.

481
00:21:33.367 --> 00:21:36.800
You uh. sure you don't
wanna try one of our specials?

482
00:21:36.934 --> 00:21:40.233
It's all a bit uh.
exotic for my taste.

483
00:21:40.367 --> 00:21:42.734
I mean. the grilled
cheese sounds okay.

484
00:21:42.867 --> 00:21:45.734
but why you gotta mess it
up with truffled cremes.

485
00:21:45.867 --> 00:21:47.133
whatever those are.

486
00:21:47.266 --> 00:21:48.734
Raminis.

487
00:21:48.867 --> 00:21:51.800
They're mushrooms and they
are full of antioxidants.

488
00:21:51.934 --> 00:21:54.567
It's a pass on. just
the coffee's good.

489
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:55.834
Okay. Enjoy.

490
00:21:56.867 --> 00:21:57.800
Oh.

491
00:21:57.934 --> 00:22:00.233
Oh. you're good. Keep it.

492
00:22:01.433 --> 00:22:02.800
Oh. Marla. it's
your lucky day.

493
00:22:02.934 --> 00:22:06.467
You can finally get those
Gucci heels you wanted.

494
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.333
It looks taller than
I thought it would be.

495
00:22:13.467 --> 00:22:14.467
Yeah.

496
00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:17.300
Let me give you a boost.

497
00:22:17.433 --> 00:22:18.700
Why can't I give you a boost?

498
00:22:18.834 --> 00:22:20.300
I've been working out.

499
00:22:20.433 --> 00:22:23.633
You think I'm going in there?

500
00:22:23.767 --> 00:22:24.633
No.

501
00:22:24.767 --> 00:22:26.133
Don't argue. Mason. Come on.

502
00:22:26.266 --> 00:22:27.967
Get on my knee.
- Fine.

503
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.700
Is that okay?
- Yeah.

504
00:22:29.834 --> 00:22:31.133
Knee on my shoulder.

505
00:22:31.266 --> 00:22:32.533
Yeah. There we go.

506
00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:34.133
What'd you have her breakfast?

507
00:22:34.266 --> 00:22:35.967
Oh. my mom made me an omelet.

508
00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.200
but she ran outta hash browns.

509
00:22:37.333 --> 00:22:40.367
It's a rhetorical
question. Mason.

510
00:22:43.767 --> 00:22:45.367
It's
disgusting in here.

511
00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.133
Just stay focused.

512
00:22:47.266 --> 00:22:48.467
Dig.

513
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.300
Oh wait. I see something.

514
00:22:51.433 --> 00:22:52.400
I got it.

515
00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:59.300
And look. there's
blood and hair.

516
00:22:59.433 --> 00:23:03.266
Try to curb your enthusiasm
that my ex might be dead.

517
00:23:12.567 --> 00:23:15.700
I hate to say it.
but he had it coming.

518
00:23:15.834 --> 00:23:17.867
Sterling waltzes into town

519
00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.433
and the butter doesn't
melt in his mouth.

520
00:23:19.567 --> 00:23:21.934
Catering swanky dinners with
ice sculptures and fountains

521
00:23:22.066 --> 00:23:25.200
and my dad has to
foot the bill again.

522
00:23:25.333 --> 00:23:26.700
Trust me. I am not losing sleep

523
00:23:26.834 --> 00:23:28.767
over either of those
two freeloaders.

524
00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.266
Hi.

525
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.934
I gotta go.

526
00:23:32.066 --> 00:23:32.967
Hi.

527
00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:34.033
I'm sorry. is this.
is this a bad time?

528
00:23:34.166 --> 00:23:35.367
No. no. not at all.

529
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:36.533
Okay.

530
00:23:36.667 --> 00:23:37.600
Thank you so much for
bringing the wedding cake.

531
00:23:37.734 --> 00:23:38.934
Yes. of course.

532
00:23:39.066 --> 00:23:41.367
Would've been a shame
for it to go to waste.

533
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.934
Well. the Hoops for Teens
Foundation is grateful.

534
00:23:44.066 --> 00:23:45.533
We've had to shut down
the programs for two weeks

535
00:23:45.667 --> 00:23:46.700
while the gym was
being repaired.

536
00:23:46.834 --> 00:23:47.767
But the kids are back tonight.

537
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.266
They're gonna enjoy the meal.

538
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.767
You're really
making a difference.

539
00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.433
Trying to.

540
00:24:05.567 --> 00:24:07.934
I'll talk to Quinn
about the autopsy report.

541
00:24:08.066 --> 00:24:09.433
You look into the hotel footage.

542
00:24:09.567 --> 00:24:11.934
But first bring the candle
hold of the forensics.

543
00:24:12.066 --> 00:24:13.100
Even with the rush order.
could take a couple days.

544
00:24:13.233 --> 00:24:14.300
Well. it's still
backlogged. huh?

545
00:24:14.433 --> 00:24:15.400
Schultz.

546
00:24:17.467 --> 00:24:19.600
Track.

547
00:24:19.734 --> 00:24:21.100
What do you doing here?

548
00:24:21.233 --> 00:24:22.667
Nice to see you too.

549
00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.700
I've been transferred.

550
00:24:26.066 --> 00:24:29.433
Temporary assignment.

551
00:24:29.567 --> 00:24:31.166
Mason. this is
Detective Dave Track

552
00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:32.433
from Third Precinct.

553
00:24:32.567 --> 00:24:35.100
Track. this is
Detective Mason Kildea.

554
00:24:35.233 --> 00:24:36.500
Look at us. three
seasoned detectives

555
00:24:36.633 --> 00:24:37.934
all in the same room.

556
00:24:38.066 --> 00:24:40.433
Yeah. I'd say two
seasoned and one bland

557
00:24:40.567 --> 00:24:42.767
but I'll let you geniuses
figure out which one's which.

558
00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:44.934
Yeah. Tom's the best.

559
00:24:45.066 --> 00:24:45.934
Taught me everything I know.

560
00:24:46.066 --> 00:24:47.934
Ah. sorry to hear that.

561
00:24:48.066 --> 00:24:50.433
Tom "Buy the books" Schultz.

562
00:24:50.567 --> 00:24:54.266
It's better than Dave
"Bend the Rules" Track.

563
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.834
Why are you here?

564
00:24:55.967 --> 00:24:59.834
Well. it seems that
I'm in and you're out.

565
00:24:59.967 --> 00:25:01.400
You're officially
on desk duty. Tom.

566
00:25:01.533 --> 00:25:04.834
So I'm gonna need the case
files for Coil and Bridgewater.

567
00:25:04.967 --> 00:25:06.066
What?

568
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:08.166
The missing bride
and dead groom.

569
00:25:08.300 --> 00:25:11.333
Yeah. I know who Coil
and Bridgewater are.

570
00:25:11.467 --> 00:25:12.734
Why am I off their cases?

571
00:25:12.867 --> 00:25:15.166
Conflict of interest.

572
00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:18.500
I mean. your missing ex-wife
plus your association

573
00:25:18.633 --> 00:25:20.166
with the deceased.

574
00:25:21.633 --> 00:25:22.834
There's no way
I'm compromised.

575
00:25:22.967 --> 00:25:24.166
Sheriff says otherwise.

576
00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.266
Sheriff?

577
00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.734
I bet you couldn't wait to
come in here and tell me this.

578
00:25:31.867 --> 00:25:33.500
It's always the high
profile cases with you. huh?

579
00:25:33.633 --> 00:25:35.433
Beats traffic duty.

580
00:25:37.867 --> 00:25:39.734
Mason. give track
the case files.

581
00:25:39.867 --> 00:25:41.767
Bring him up to speed.

582
00:25:42.967 --> 00:25:46.066
Oh. honey. I'm so
glad softball went well.

583
00:25:47.467 --> 00:25:48.600
Your backpack?

584
00:25:49.867 --> 00:25:53.166
I don't know. but I
can check the car.

585
00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.433
Okay. hold on.

586
00:25:55.533 --> 00:25:57.734
Let me see here.

587
00:25:57.867 --> 00:26:01.400
Oh. yeah. it is right here.

588
00:26:01.533 --> 00:26:04.233
Do you want me to
leave it with dad?

589
00:26:04.367 --> 00:26:05.233
Okay.

590
00:26:05.367 --> 00:26:06.300
I'll drop it off at X-ray.

591
00:26:07.867 --> 00:26:09.900
The hotel fob sees Jessamyn
entering her room at 10:40 AM.

592
00:26:10.033 --> 00:26:11.567
Is there security footage?

593
00:26:11.700 --> 00:26:13.233
Mostly at the front with
a couple of blind spots

594
00:26:13.367 --> 00:26:14.567
at the side exits.

595
00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.967
So we never actually see
Jess coming or going.

596
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:20.633
She could have left on
her own or been abducted.

597
00:26:22.033 --> 00:26:25.066
We also got an
anonymous tip. alibi.

598
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.900
Anonymous. huh?

599
00:26:29.033 --> 00:26:32.967
Yeah. it
was. it was anonymous.

600
00:27:17.166 --> 00:27:19.600
ester.

601
00:27:19.734 --> 00:27:21.100
Sorry. I didn't
mean to scare you.

602
00:27:21.233 --> 00:27:23.433
I saw you in x-ray. but you
were walking away so fast.

603
00:27:23.567 --> 00:27:27.433
Yeah. basements and
hospitals aren't my favorite.

604
00:27:27.567 --> 00:27:30.700
What are
you doing in x-ray?

605
00:27:30.834 --> 00:27:32.200
Is it about the bruise?

606
00:27:32.333 --> 00:27:34.533
My ego is more
bruised than this eye.

607
00:27:34.667 --> 00:27:36.700
but I got the all clear.
It's not a concussion. so.

608
00:27:36.834 --> 00:27:38.767
Well. that's good.

609
00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:40.300
What did happen?

610
00:27:41.834 --> 00:27:46.433
Just a heated basketball game.

611
00:27:46.567 --> 00:27:48.934
It serves me right for trying
to show up a bunch of teens.

612
00:27:49.066 --> 00:27:51.700
Mm. the morning
of the wedding.

613
00:27:51.834 --> 00:27:53.367
That's. that's brave.

614
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.200
It was a. it
was an early game.

615
00:27:56.333 --> 00:27:58.767
I coach underserved
kids. basketball.

616
00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:00.100
I didn't know that.

617
00:28:00.233 --> 00:28:02.500
Yeah. Hoops for Teens.

618
00:28:02.633 --> 00:28:04.100
Jessamyn signed me up.

619
00:28:04.233 --> 00:28:05.934
She said it would be a
good image for our brand.

620
00:28:06.066 --> 00:28:07.200
but it's fun.

621
00:28:09.233 --> 00:28:10.500
I. I could have
sworn Hunter said

622
00:28:10.633 --> 00:28:13.166
that the program was
shut down for two weeks.

623
00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.667
Hm.

624
00:28:19.133 --> 00:28:20.533
Hey. what's up?

625
00:28:22.633 --> 00:28:26.100
I just ran into Chester and
you need to recheck his alibi.

626
00:28:26.233 --> 00:28:28.600
I think he's lying about
how he got that eye.

627
00:28:28.734 --> 00:28:30.500
Well. I wish I could.

628
00:28:30.633 --> 00:28:31.767
I'm off the case.

629
00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:32.767
What?

630
00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:34.934
Conflict of interest.

631
00:28:35.066 --> 00:28:36.100
I'm pushing paper now.

632
00:28:36.233 --> 00:28:37.834
Then. who's running
the case. Mason?

633
00:28:37.967 --> 00:28:39.333
No. no.

634
00:28:39.467 --> 00:28:44.000
They brought in an outside
detective. this guy. Dave Track.

635
00:28:44.133 --> 00:28:45.934
You say his name
like you know him.

636
00:28:46.066 --> 00:28:47.133
There's history there.

637
00:28:47.266 --> 00:28:49.433
He's done some shady
things to solve crimes.

638
00:28:49.567 --> 00:28:51.433
Why would they bring
someone like that in?

639
00:28:51.567 --> 00:28:53.934
It was
out of my control.

640
00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:55.100
I'm sorry.

641
00:28:55.233 --> 00:28:57.834
Look. whoever killed Sterling

642
00:28:57.967 --> 00:29:00.567
is also responsible for
Jess's disappearance.

643
00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.233
The first 48 hours are crucial.

644
00:29:03.367 --> 00:29:05.233
Okay. So what can I do?

645
00:29:05.367 --> 00:29:06.667
How can I help?

646
00:29:08.867 --> 00:29:09.834
Can you break
into Quinn's office

647
00:29:09.967 --> 00:29:11.834
and steal the autopsy report?

648
00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.667
What?

649
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.667
No. no. I was kidding.

650
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:23.233
- Listen--
- You can't do that.

651
00:29:23.367 --> 00:29:25.734
I know you have to say what
you have to say. but like we.

652
00:29:25.867 --> 00:29:27.000
I got it. I got you.

653
00:29:27.133 --> 00:29:28.133
- You can't--
- I hear you.

654
00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:29.166
If you hear. don't
worry about it.

655
00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.333
It's gonna be fine.

656
00:29:46.967 --> 00:29:47.834
Hey Mason.

657
00:29:47.967 --> 00:29:48.867
Hey Goldy.

658
00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Hi.

659
00:29:50.133 --> 00:29:51.834
Are those
Snickerdoodle muffins?

660
00:29:51.967 --> 00:29:53.567
Those are like my favorite.

661
00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:54.667
Really?

662
00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.166
I didn't know that.

663
00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:57.734
Well. I was bringing 'em
to the precinct. but here.

664
00:29:57.867 --> 00:29:59.166
help yourself.

665
00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.233
If you don't mind.

666
00:30:00.367 --> 00:30:03.400
Yeah!

667
00:30:03.533 --> 00:30:05.600
Oh. these are so good.

668
00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.834
Aw. thank you.

669
00:30:08.967 --> 00:30:11.333
You must be so busy
with both cases.

670
00:30:11.467 --> 00:30:12.533
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

671
00:30:12.667 --> 00:30:14.834
But I can't really
talk about it. you know?

672
00:30:14.967 --> 00:30:15.934
Of course.

673
00:30:17.133 --> 00:30:18.734
I just can't stop
thinking about Sterling

674
00:30:18.867 --> 00:30:22.567
and. and what happened
and. and just the pain

675
00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:24.233
that he must have been.

676
00:30:24.367 --> 00:30:27.500
I mean. he had blunt
force trauma to the head.

677
00:30:27.633 --> 00:30:29.667
but Quinn found
champagne in his lungs.

678
00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:31.066
Drowning is not as
painful as you think.

679
00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.567
Sure the champagne burns a bit.

680
00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:35.000
but then Sterling probably
drifted off to sleep.

681
00:30:35.133 --> 00:30:37.166
So you know. if it helps. I
hear it's a peaceful way to go.

682
00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.567
Mm. so cause of
death was drowning.

683
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:46.000
Wait. what's in these
Snickerdoodle muffins?

684
00:30:46.133 --> 00:30:47.567
Truth serum?

685
00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:49.033
Gotta go.

686
00:30:49.166 --> 00:30:50.166
Oh. Mason.

687
00:30:52.467 --> 00:30:55.567
Oh. thanks.

688
00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.166
Bye Mason.

689
00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.333
Bye. Goldy.

690
00:31:11.433 --> 00:31:14.734
Here you go.

691
00:31:14.867 --> 00:31:17.233
CCTV cameras around town
showed no sign of Jess.

692
00:31:17.367 --> 00:31:20.734
but the forensics came
back on the candle holder.

693
00:31:20.867 --> 00:31:22.567
It's a match to Jessamyn DNA.

694
00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.066
The thing is.

695
00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.233
there are multiple prints
from the wedding party.

696
00:31:25.367 --> 00:31:26.266
plus a few partials.

697
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.400
but they're too smeared to ID.

698
00:31:27.533 --> 00:31:29.300
No hits in CODIS.

699
00:31:29.433 --> 00:31:30.467
So whoever ditched
the candle there

700
00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.734
is likely our murderer.

701
00:31:32.867 --> 00:31:36.467
They're either very
sloppy or brilliant.

702
00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.066
With all the prints.

703
00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.800
we would be just spinning
our wheels going nowhere.

704
00:31:40.934 --> 00:31:42.333
And they know it.

705
00:31:42.467 --> 00:31:45.233
Whose idea was it to search the
dumpsters outside the hotel?

706
00:31:45.367 --> 00:31:46.734
Tom's. but--

707
00:31:46.867 --> 00:31:48.133
It's also Tom's DNA on
the victim's shoe. right?

708
00:31:48.266 --> 00:31:49.300
Yeah. But that--

709
00:31:49.433 --> 00:31:50.533
And guess who's
the beneficiary

710
00:31:50.667 --> 00:31:51.600
of Jessamyn life
insurance policy?

711
00:31:54.033 --> 00:31:56.066
I hate to say it.

712
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.734
looks like we have a
new person of interest.

713
00:32:05.266 --> 00:32:06.200
No. exactly.

714
00:32:06.333 --> 00:32:07.467
When does that happen?

715
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.033
Hi. can I help you
ladies with anything?

716
00:32:09.166 --> 00:32:10.033
Just looking for now. thanks.

717
00:32:10.166 --> 00:32:11.033
Okay.

718
00:32:11.166 --> 00:32:12.367
Yeah honestly. so weird.

719
00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.867
I know. the lab
results were so random.

720
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.867
but I saw Quinn emptying
his stomach contents myself.

721
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.367
Newly dead on his wedding day.

722
00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:20.867
Poor guy.

723
00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.300
He had a swollen tongue.
contact dermatitis on his hand.

724
00:32:23.433 --> 00:32:25.033
but no food in his stomach.

725
00:32:25.166 --> 00:32:26.533
It's plain weird.

726
00:32:26.667 --> 00:32:27.967
Hey. how about this?

727
00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.700
Your mom loves lilies.

728
00:32:29.834 --> 00:32:30.967
Do this one.

729
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:36.633
And I had to.

730
00:32:36.767 --> 00:32:38.133
Does it ever stop?

731
00:32:38.266 --> 00:32:41.633
No. no.

732
00:32:41.767 --> 00:32:44.800
Well. thank you
for feeding me.

733
00:32:44.934 --> 00:32:46.133
You know. you didn't have to.

734
00:32:46.266 --> 00:32:48.300
Have you met me?

735
00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:53.467
You know your food's good.
but your company's even better.

736
00:32:54.834 --> 00:32:56.233
It goes both ways.

737
00:32:58.767 --> 00:33:01.033
How are you holding up?

738
00:33:01.166 --> 00:33:05.600
I mean. I know you and Jess
aren't together anymore.

739
00:33:05.734 --> 00:33:07.367
but still this has to be hard.

740
00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:08.767
I might not be in
love with Jess still.

741
00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.333
but I just don't want
anything bad to happen to her.

742
00:33:10.467 --> 00:33:11.367
You know?

743
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.867
Of course not. no one does.

744
00:33:16.333 --> 00:33:22.367
I feel stuck now
that I'm desked.

745
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:25.533
I feel lost without
my murder board.

746
00:33:31.333 --> 00:33:32.233
What?

747
00:33:32.367 --> 00:33:33.367
What?

748
00:33:34.834 --> 00:33:36.533
Not again.

749
00:33:36.667 --> 00:33:37.567
Goldy.

750
00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:39.033
Okay. listen. don't be mad.

751
00:33:39.166 --> 00:33:42.467
All right?

752
00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:54.433
I. you know. printed out
pictures of the bridal party

753
00:33:54.567 --> 00:33:56.934
and used Marla's leftover
flowers. and then they threw

754
00:33:57.066 --> 00:33:58.533
the seating tread out.

755
00:33:58.667 --> 00:34:01.934
So I took that and. well.
those were just pretty. and I.

756
00:34:02.066 --> 00:34:04.533
you know. made a murder board.

757
00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.433
Yeah.

758
00:34:08.567 --> 00:34:09.500
Well. it's certainly
the prettiest murder board

759
00:34:09.633 --> 00:34:11.166
I've ever seen.

760
00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.266
Thank you.

761
00:34:13.734 --> 00:34:15.433
You're not gonna
lecture me. are you?

762
00:34:15.567 --> 00:34:19.000
I think it's
downright brilliant.

763
00:34:19.133 --> 00:34:20.900
Well. in that case.

764
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.500
Okay.

765
00:34:30.633 --> 00:34:32.266
Blunt force trauma.

766
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.266
Cause of death drowning.

767
00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.433
Wait. are you...

768
00:34:37.567 --> 00:34:39.000
Are you just guessing?

769
00:34:39.133 --> 00:34:41.667
It's uh. it's a little
more than a hunch.

770
00:34:41.800 --> 00:34:44.433
Allergic reaction.
that's a question mark.

771
00:34:44.567 --> 00:34:46.500
How did you get your
hands on the autopsy report?

772
00:34:46.633 --> 00:34:48.433
Nothing illegal.

773
00:34:48.567 --> 00:34:50.667
Stomach was empty.

774
00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.934
Goldy. you're something else.

775
00:34:53.066 --> 00:34:55.166
Is that a good
thing or a bad thing?

776
00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.934
It's definitely a good thing.

777
00:35:00.667 --> 00:35:03.333
Okay. so Hunter was
saying something about

778
00:35:03.467 --> 00:35:05.000
selling bad software.

779
00:35:05.133 --> 00:35:06.166
You know anything about that?

780
00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:07.567
Oh yeah. well.

781
00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.667
when Sterling's family
moved here from New York.

782
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:14.000
his dad convinced a lot of
people to fund a startup

783
00:35:14.133 --> 00:35:16.834
whose software was
supposed to be fail safe.

784
00:35:16.967 --> 00:35:18.667
Well. they didn't
read the fine print

785
00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.567
and he wanted it that
way because in the end.

786
00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:23.667
his bad software caused. well.

787
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:25.333
pretty much everybody
to lose their money.

788
00:35:25.467 --> 00:35:27.567
The only people that made
money was Sterling's family.

789
00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:28.734
who then skipped town.

790
00:35:28.867 --> 00:35:30.500
Wait. that was years ago.

791
00:35:30.633 --> 00:35:31.867
Sterling was just a teenager.

792
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.667
It was his father that
scammed them. not Sterling.

793
00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:35.734
It's Elk Park.
it's a small town.

794
00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:38.900
I mean. people
remember these things.

795
00:35:39.033 --> 00:35:42.400
Yeah. revenge is a
timeless motive for murder.

796
00:35:42.533 --> 00:35:44.000
I wonder which
families were affected?

797
00:35:44.133 --> 00:35:46.000
Good question.

798
00:35:46.133 --> 00:35:47.667
One second.
- Yeah.

799
00:35:49.133 --> 00:35:50.166
Hi. ma'am.

800
00:35:50.300 --> 00:35:51.834
I'm detective Track.

801
00:35:51.967 --> 00:35:53.166
Sorry to intrude.

802
00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:55.066
Hi Goldy. Marla said
Tom would be here.

803
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.834
She did. Did she?

804
00:35:59.533 --> 00:36:00.734
Mason.

805
00:36:00.867 --> 00:36:01.967
Track. what's up?

806
00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.900
Tom. in light of new evidence.

807
00:36:05.033 --> 00:36:07.066
need to hand in your badge
and gun and come with us.

808
00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:09.066
My badge and my...

809
00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:10.300
What new evidence.
what do you mean?

810
00:36:10.433 --> 00:36:11.900
Yeah. what evidence?

811
00:36:12.033 --> 00:36:14.567
And also. you are clearly
making a mistake here.

812
00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.400
Furthermore. I don't like how
you're going around town--

813
00:36:17.533 --> 00:36:19.767
Goldy. it's okay.
it's okay. it's okay.

814
00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:20.867
I'm coming.

815
00:36:25.367 --> 00:36:27.734
Hey. go to City Hall.

816
00:36:27.867 --> 00:36:29.967
Search land registry
records for foreclosures

817
00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.300
around the time of the scam.

818
00:36:31.433 --> 00:36:32.400
Okay?

819
00:36:33.934 --> 00:36:35.133
Stay safe.

820
00:36:35.266 --> 00:36:36.300
Let's go. Schultz.

821
00:36:36.433 --> 00:36:38.233
Yeah. I'm coming.

822
00:36:38.367 --> 00:36:39.800
Sorry. boss.

823
00:36:47.033 --> 00:36:49.834
ightly t)

824
00:37:08.934 --> 00:37:13.734
Piece of cake. Golden Berry.

825
00:37:18.767 --> 00:37:22.633
All right. maybe
not a piece of cake.

826
00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:32.834
Okay.

827
00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:56.667
Yes.

828
00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:07.567
No.

829
00:38:20.333 --> 00:38:25.467
I can't. can't. can't. can't.

830
00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.967
Ann lost her house.

831
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.600
The evidence points to you.

832
00:39:05.734 --> 00:39:08.133
Motive. opportunity. intent.

833
00:39:09.567 --> 00:39:14.533
confess. and maybe you'll
get leniency on sentencing.

834
00:39:18.667 --> 00:39:19.533
Jess called you in the morning.

835
00:39:19.667 --> 00:39:21.100
She disappeared at 10:03.

836
00:39:21.233 --> 00:39:22.867
Why?

837
00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.700
I told you.

838
00:39:24.834 --> 00:39:26.367
She left the voicemail.

839
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:28.200
I called her back and
she didn't answer.

840
00:39:28.333 --> 00:39:29.433
Is it normal for a
bride to call her ex

841
00:39:29.567 --> 00:39:30.767
the morning of her wedding?

842
00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:33.367
Nothing about Jess is normal.

843
00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:36.033
What's your angle. Tom?

844
00:39:36.166 --> 00:39:38.433
Kill Sterling. with Jess gone.
collect her life insurance?

845
00:39:38.567 --> 00:39:40.367
Or is it that she's waiting
for you and that this was your

846
00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:41.600
plan with her all along?

847
00:39:41.734 --> 00:39:43.867
That's your theory?

848
00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:44.967
It's absurd.

849
00:39:46.066 --> 00:39:50.266
Mason. you still
looking for her?

850
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:54.100
Okay. we're gonna
play this my way.

851
00:39:55.734 --> 00:39:57.700
I guess the apple doesn't
fall far from the tree. huh?

852
00:39:57.834 --> 00:39:58.800
Who knows?

853
00:40:00.066 --> 00:40:04.767
Maybe you and your old
man will be cellmates.

854
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:07.533
It's been what. 25 years?

855
00:40:07.667 --> 00:40:09.667
24. but who's counting?

856
00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:10.700
Where's Jessamyn?

857
00:40:10.834 --> 00:40:12.700
Sterling cut my hand.

858
00:40:14.066 --> 00:40:15.266
So yeah. there'd be
blood transfer on my shoe

859
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.100
as well as the champagne glass.

860
00:40:18.233 --> 00:40:20.200
As for the life
insurance policy.

861
00:40:20.333 --> 00:40:23.033
Jess obviously forgot to
change the beneficiary.

862
00:40:23.166 --> 00:40:25.867
You know. the DA hasn't
filed charges yet.

863
00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.333
which means your case
has too many holes.

864
00:40:30.667 --> 00:40:37.033
So unless you arrest me.
can't keep me here any longer.

865
00:40:37.166 --> 00:40:38.700
So I'm leaving.

866
00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:52.600
Don't leave town.

867
00:40:52.734 --> 00:40:54.266
It wasn't right.

868
00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.767
Turning off an audio
recorder during an interview.

869
00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.767
And there you get fired
if you play by the rules.

870
00:40:58.900 --> 00:41:01.934
Evidence gathered deceitfully
is inadmissible in court.

871
00:41:02.066 --> 00:41:03.767
God. wake up.

872
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.600
Judging by that deer
caught in headlights look.

873
00:41:06.734 --> 00:41:08.266
you didn't even know Tom's
dad was in the slammer.

874
00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.600
That's just. it's
just my normal look.

875
00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.600
I'm just saying
maybe you don't really

876
00:41:14.734 --> 00:41:17.600
know your mentor that well.

877
00:41:17.734 --> 00:41:19.333
I'm gonna need you to tail him.

878
00:41:25.734 --> 00:41:26.834
Room service.

879
00:41:26.967 --> 00:41:29.667
Goldy.
what a nice surprise.

880
00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.767
Ah. I have a question.

881
00:41:33.233 --> 00:41:35.333
Would you think less of me
as a mother if I had you

882
00:41:35.467 --> 00:41:39.166
surgically attach this
to our daughter's back?

883
00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.166
She gets her absent
mindedness from me.

884
00:41:41.300 --> 00:41:44.266
I'm sorry I muddled
the gene pool.

885
00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:45.500
Are those eclairs?

886
00:41:47.567 --> 00:41:48.767
Okay. What do you need?

887
00:41:48.900 --> 00:41:50.433
Who said I needed anything?

888
00:41:50.567 --> 00:41:51.600
Goldy. we have
known each other

889
00:41:51.734 --> 00:41:54.100
for a very. very long time.

890
00:41:54.233 --> 00:41:56.533
I love-hate that about us.

891
00:41:57.734 --> 00:41:58.934
Tom got suspended.

892
00:41:59.066 --> 00:42:00.834
What. what happened?

893
00:42:00.967 --> 00:42:03.900
There's this new
cop and he is trying

894
00:42:04.033 --> 00:42:05.900
to pin Sterling's murder on Tom.

895
00:42:06.033 --> 00:42:07.000
Wow.

896
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:12.066
And he would never.
ever. ever. ever ask.

897
00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.600
but he really needs our help.

898
00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.767
Ah...

899
00:42:23.967 --> 00:42:30.734
You know. Goldy. I would
really love to help Tom.

900
00:42:30.867 --> 00:42:32.000
You know. I would.

901
00:42:32.133 --> 00:42:35.333
but I can't tell you
anything about someone

902
00:42:35.467 --> 00:42:37.333
from the wedding party
who came to my office

903
00:42:37.467 --> 00:42:39.567
Saturday afternoon
with a broken hand

904
00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:42.333
and a really lame excuse
on how that happened.

905
00:42:42.467 --> 00:42:43.333
Mm-hmm.

906
00:42:43.467 --> 00:42:44.900
See. I could lose my license.

907
00:42:45.033 --> 00:42:46.400
Of course.

908
00:42:46.533 --> 00:42:48.166
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

909
00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:50.667
So I'm just gonna
go look for a coffee

910
00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.567
to pair with my eclair.

911
00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:53.834
Okay.

912
00:42:53.967 --> 00:42:57.300
Yeah. I might be
10. maybe 15 minutes.

913
00:43:13.266 --> 00:43:19.734
Ray.

914
00:43:19.867 --> 00:43:20.734
Oh. hey.
- Hey.

915
00:43:20.867 --> 00:43:22.233
Are you cleared?

916
00:43:22.367 --> 00:43:23.400
Yeah. No.

917
00:43:23.533 --> 00:43:24.834
No. not yet.

918
00:43:24.967 --> 00:43:25.834
Thanks for coming to get me.

919
00:43:25.967 --> 00:43:28.000
Yeah. I was so worried.

920
00:43:30.633 --> 00:43:32.400
Maybe you should
keep your distance.

921
00:43:32.533 --> 00:43:33.900
Stop. don't even do that.

922
00:43:34.033 --> 00:43:38.000
Nobody believes that you had
anything to do with this.

923
00:43:38.133 --> 00:43:39.567
It's not that.

924
00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:43.000
It's something Track
said about my dad.

925
00:43:44.033 --> 00:43:48.166
What about him?

926
00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.166
I haven't shared
this with anyone.

927
00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:53.166
but my dad's in prison.

928
00:43:59.133 --> 00:44:00.800
See. that's the look. That's
why I don't talk about it.

929
00:44:00.934 --> 00:44:02.400
I'm sorry. I...

930
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.300
I have a lot of questions.

931
00:44:09.433 --> 00:44:13.233
But first. how does Track
even know about this?

932
00:44:16.033 --> 00:44:19.567
It was his dad
that put my dad away.

933
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:20.800
And you're afraid he's gonna

934
00:44:20.934 --> 00:44:22.967
use that information
against you?

935
00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:27.900
Look. I just. I wanted you
to know before anybody else.

936
00:44:29.367 --> 00:44:30.967
I'm sorry.

937
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:32.400
Thanks.

938
00:44:32.533 --> 00:44:34.567
You are not your dad.

939
00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:36.066
And whatever he did.

940
00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:40.400
it doesn't change who you
are or what you mean to me.

941
00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:49.066
Or you know. there are
people. other people and hey.

942
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.967
welcome to the club.

943
00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:53.133
Everyone in Elk Park has
been a suspect for murder

944
00:44:53.266 --> 00:44:57.567
at some point in this
past year. including me.

945
00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:59.633
And you're still talking to me.

946
00:44:59.767 --> 00:45:01.800
Well. the night's still young.

947
00:45:01.934 --> 00:45:06.266
Let's
go get your car.

948
00:45:13.166 --> 00:45:14.800
So Ray showed up the
morning of the wedding

949
00:45:14.934 --> 00:45:18.133
with a busted hand. but
he didn't have a cast.

950
00:45:18.266 --> 00:45:19.867
He flinched and
Mason shook his hand.

951
00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.367
Which begs the question. when
exactly did Ray do it and how?

952
00:45:23.500 --> 00:45:26.200
Well. I'm headed to the
ground search right now.

953
00:45:26.333 --> 00:45:27.967
and Ray will be there.

954
00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:30.700
So why don't you go home
and then you come back later

955
00:45:30.834 --> 00:45:34.200
and we can put our
heads together?

956
00:45:34.333 --> 00:45:35.533
Okay. Okay.

957
00:45:49.767 --> 00:45:52.967
Look out. coming through.

958
00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:54.066
That's my
best friend's wedding.

959
00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:55.100
Come on.

960
00:45:56.266 --> 00:45:59.000
No!

961
00:45:59.133 --> 00:46:00.166
Ray. I...

962
00:46:06.667 --> 00:46:10.100
Here. you and I.
we'll go up here.

963
00:46:12.233 --> 00:46:14.266
You remember these woods?

964
00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:15.867
We'd come here.
me with Sterling.

965
00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.200
You with that Freckly ginger.

966
00:46:18.333 --> 00:46:19.266
Freddy.

967
00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:21.367
My gosh. Yes.

968
00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:25.300
Such innocent and happy
times until it wasn't.

969
00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.767
I couldn't help but
notice you and Ray earlier.

970
00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:33.600
Is everything okay?

971
00:46:33.734 --> 00:46:37.200
I found an engagement
ring in a suitcase.

972
00:46:37.333 --> 00:46:39.033
and when I asked about it.

973
00:46:39.166 --> 00:46:42.867
Ray admitted he was going
to propose this weekend.

974
00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.633
That's wonderful?

975
00:46:46.166 --> 00:46:49.100
Except I said I'm not ready.

976
00:46:49.233 --> 00:46:50.266
He didn't buy it.

977
00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.867
He thinks there's
something more.

978
00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:53.867
Is there?

979
00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.033
No.

980
00:46:55.166 --> 00:46:56.533
No. timing is everything.

981
00:46:56.667 --> 00:46:59.133
And with all this going on...

982
00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.000
Well. relationships are hard.

983
00:47:04.133 --> 00:47:05.333
even on their good days.

984
00:47:05.467 --> 00:47:07.166
You'll get through it.

985
00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:08.266
Yeah.

986
00:47:09.567 --> 00:47:13.500
He's my person. but
Ray can be insecure.

987
00:47:13.633 --> 00:47:15.433
Sterling's ribbing at
the rehearsal dinner

988
00:47:15.567 --> 00:47:18.333
about getting back together
with me didn't help.

989
00:47:18.467 --> 00:47:20.433
Anyway. it's like
Ray and I always say.

990
00:47:20.567 --> 00:47:23.600
there's nothing more
important than love.

991
00:47:23.734 --> 00:47:28.734
Never take it for granted
because it can be too late.

992
00:47:28.867 --> 00:47:30.000
I'll never love again.

993
00:47:30.133 --> 00:47:32.166
Of course you will.

994
00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:35.266
No. "I'll Never Love Again."

995
00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:37.100
It's a book.

996
00:47:37.233 --> 00:47:39.433
Wait. Jess was reading that.

997
00:47:39.567 --> 00:47:41.667
I lent it to her.

998
00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:43.266
Okay. Don't touch anything.

999
00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:44.834
Flag it and I'll.
I'll grab a cop.

1000
00:47:44.967 --> 00:47:45.934
Hey. over here.

1001
00:47:46.066 --> 00:47:47.934
I think I found something.

1002
00:47:55.066 --> 00:47:57.166
It's Jess's cell.

1003
00:47:57.300 --> 00:47:58.400
She loved her
Zuwalksi Crystals.

1004
00:47:58.533 --> 00:47:59.433
Loved?

1005
00:47:59.567 --> 00:48:00.700
It's okay.

1006
00:48:00.834 --> 00:48:03.333
You referred to her
in the past tense.

1007
00:48:03.467 --> 00:48:05.567
You know what I mean.

1008
00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:08.500
Why would I ever want
anything to happen to her?

1009
00:48:08.633 --> 00:48:09.567
You'd get sole possession

1010
00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.066
of Whitetail Realty for one.

1011
00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:12.900
With her gone. my
workload has just doubled.

1012
00:48:13.033 --> 00:48:14.667
I have to take on
all of her clients.

1013
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:16.567
And we all know you weren't
a fan of Jess or Sterling.

1014
00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.667
I have nothing against them.

1015
00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:19.066
We just had
different priorities.

1016
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:20.567
and I'm tired of them
taking my dad for a ride.

1017
00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:23.400
Hey. will you just
stop it. the both of you?

1018
00:48:23.533 --> 00:48:26.400
Can't you see what
you're doing to my wife?

1019
00:48:26.533 --> 00:48:28.200
My apologies.

1020
00:48:28.333 --> 00:48:29.333
Sorry.

1021
00:48:31.467 --> 00:48:33.500
It's okay.

1022
00:48:33.633 --> 00:48:36.166
God. this is just
so distressing.

1023
00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:38.000
What can I do to help?

1024
00:48:38.133 --> 00:48:41.900
We're
holding a candlelight vigil

1025
00:48:42.033 --> 00:48:44.900
outside our home this evening.

1026
00:48:45.033 --> 00:48:47.333
Do you think you could do a
rush order on some finger food?

1027
00:48:47.467 --> 00:48:48.667
Just whatever you can--

1028
00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:50.667
Of course. I'll
drop them off later.

1029
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.233
Thank you.

1030
00:48:52.367 --> 00:48:53.834
Yeah. I'm a mess.

1031
00:48:54.967 --> 00:48:56.000
Where's my. where's my Jess?

1032
00:48:56.133 --> 00:48:57.066
I mean. where could she be?

1033
00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.133
We'll find her.

1034
00:48:58.266 --> 00:48:59.166
We'll find her.

1035
00:49:22.066 --> 00:49:22.934
Hi Goldy.

1036
00:49:23.066 --> 00:49:24.200
Hi.

1037
00:49:24.333 --> 00:49:25.266
Your food was a huge
hit with the kids.

1038
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:26.266
Thanks again.

1039
00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:27.867
Thank you.

1040
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.867
And I'm sorry about earlier
at the park with Chester.

1041
00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.867
I got carried away.

1042
00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.367
You don't need to apologize
to me. I understand.

1043
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:38.533
Emotions are running
high right now.

1044
00:49:38.667 --> 00:49:39.934
Yeah.

1045
00:49:40.066 --> 00:49:41.200
Feels like it's been one
nonstop fight since the wedding

1046
00:49:41.333 --> 00:49:42.700
came to town.

1047
00:49:42.834 --> 00:49:44.033
First. the one at the reception.

1048
00:49:44.166 --> 00:49:45.934
then the one the
parking lot after.

1049
00:49:46.066 --> 00:49:48.934
What. what happened
in the parking lot?

1050
00:49:49.066 --> 00:49:50.433
Well. I only caught
the tail end of it.

1051
00:49:50.567 --> 00:49:54.367
but Chester and Sterling
were at it again.

1052
00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:57.700
And obviously Chester didn't
come out of it too well.

1053
00:49:57.834 --> 00:49:58.767
See ya.
- Yeah.

1054
00:50:03.734 --> 00:50:08.266
Hey. one dopeo double
espresso macchiato.

1055
00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:09.433
Thank you.

1056
00:50:09.567 --> 00:50:10.700
Let's get to work.

1057
00:50:10.834 --> 00:50:11.867
Yes.

1058
00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.700
And working on
Ann's rushed order.

1059
00:50:14.834 --> 00:50:15.767
Ooh!

1060
00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:16.867
Hold on.

1061
00:50:18.333 --> 00:50:19.433
Hey Marla.

1062
00:50:19.567 --> 00:50:21.100
He's right outside my shop.

1063
00:50:21.233 --> 00:50:22.433
I dunno.

1064
00:50:22.567 --> 00:50:24.100
Who's right outside your shop?

1065
00:50:24.233 --> 00:50:26.100
Ray. you said you
wanted to talk to him.

1066
00:50:26.233 --> 00:50:27.600
If you hurry up.
you can catch him.

1067
00:50:27.734 --> 00:50:30.700
Just be careful because
Mason and Track are here.

1068
00:50:30.834 --> 00:50:32.266
Okay. Thank you.

1069
00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:33.266
What's up?

1070
00:50:33.400 --> 00:50:34.266
Ray is outside Marla's shop.

1071
00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.200
Well. let's go talk to him.

1072
00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:39.033
You can't be be seen
interrogating Ray.

1073
00:50:39.166 --> 00:50:40.367
And I can't leave my dough

1074
00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:43.367
or the baking
powder will go flat.

1075
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:50.800
I have a crazy idea.

1076
00:50:53.834 --> 00:50:57.367
Okay. you wanna preheat
the oven to 350.

1077
00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.767
You're gonna roll
the dough evenly.

1078
00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:02.934
Then you're gonna add a
teaspoon of the filling.

1079
00:51:03.066 --> 00:51:06.433
first the cheese. then
the mushroom mixture.

1080
00:51:06.567 --> 00:51:09.266
You wanna pinch the edges of
the dumpling and then brush

1081
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.767
each dumpling with the egg wash.

1082
00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:13.066
Then you bake.

1083
00:51:14.233 --> 00:51:15.333
Are you good?

1084
00:51:15.467 --> 00:51:16.934
You lost me after
preheat the oven.

1085
00:51:17.066 --> 00:51:21.533
You'll be fine.
just don't overwork the dough.

1086
00:51:23.133 --> 00:51:24.767
But you know. that
goes for you too. okay?

1087
00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:26.934
Don't press Ray too hard
or he's gonna clam up.

1088
00:51:27.066 --> 00:51:28.433
Okay.

1089
00:51:28.567 --> 00:51:31.266
Find out how he broke
his hand. but act natural.

1090
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:32.767
Act natural.

1091
00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:33.767
Got it.

1092
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:35.433
All right. I see him.

1093
00:51:38.133 --> 00:51:39.767
I'm switching to Bluetooth.

1094
00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.000
Okay.

1095
00:51:41.133 --> 00:51:42.767
Well. there's a $300
charge on my credit card

1096
00:51:42.900 --> 00:51:44.000
that I never authorized.

1097
00:51:44.133 --> 00:51:46.433
I'd like the charges
reversed please.

1098
00:51:46.567 --> 00:51:47.500
Car key replacement?

1099
00:51:47.633 --> 00:51:49.767
What are you talking about?

1100
00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:51.767
The contract never said...

1101
00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:54.734
Ah. fine.

1102
00:51:55.967 --> 00:51:58.433
Stupid car rental
agency is sh...

1103
00:51:58.567 --> 00:52:01.000
Ray. hi!

1104
00:52:01.133 --> 00:52:03.233
It's so funny meeting you here.

1105
00:52:03.367 --> 00:52:04.233
Hey. Goldy.

1106
00:52:04.367 --> 00:52:06.000
I said act natural.

1107
00:52:06.133 --> 00:52:08.000
Whoa. your cast.

1108
00:52:08.133 --> 00:52:09.567
How did that happen?

1109
00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:10.667
Easy. Berry.

1110
00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:11.734
It's too heavy handed.

1111
00:52:11.867 --> 00:52:12.967
I'm trying.

1112
00:52:14.467 --> 00:52:16.333
You're trying?

1113
00:52:16.467 --> 00:52:18.500
Focus. Goldy.

1114
00:52:18.633 --> 00:52:22.767
Trying to understand
what happened to your hand.

1115
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.567
You look like you got
yourself in a pickle.

1116
00:52:26.700 --> 00:52:27.567
A pickle?

1117
00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:29.000
It's nothing.

1118
00:52:29.133 --> 00:52:31.266
I just fell in the shower.

1119
00:52:32.367 --> 00:52:38.333
Wow. it just must have
been a really hard fall.

1120
00:52:38.467 --> 00:52:40.066
You lost him. Barry.

1121
00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:42.333
You did it. you
overworked the dough.

1122
00:52:42.467 --> 00:52:46.567
Okay. I cannot do this
with you in my ear. okay?

1123
00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:49.600
Just don't burn my
pastry. Schultz.

1124
00:52:51.633 --> 00:52:52.600
Barry.

1125
00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:56.333
Goldy?

1126
00:52:56.467 --> 00:52:57.333
You know what?

1127
00:52:57.467 --> 00:52:58.834
Let me help you.

1128
00:52:58.967 --> 00:53:00.233
Thank you.

1129
00:53:00.367 --> 00:53:01.333
Of course.

1130
00:53:04.033 --> 00:53:06.800
Got some orange
smudge on your cast.

1131
00:53:06.934 --> 00:53:08.300
Oh. yeah.

1132
00:53:08.433 --> 00:53:10.233
It was these cheesy crackers
Ann was giving everyone.

1133
00:53:10.367 --> 00:53:12.467
we were all snacking on them.

1134
00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:13.600
Casa...

1135
00:53:13.734 --> 00:53:14.700
Cassava.

1136
00:53:15.767 --> 00:53:17.233
They uh. they get everywhere.

1137
00:53:17.367 --> 00:53:19.066
Yeah. probably not a good idea

1138
00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.667
to have everyone sign
my cast afterwards.

1139
00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:30.567
We uh. we missed you
at the ground search.

1140
00:53:30.700 --> 00:53:33.900
Yeah. I just needed
some time alone.

1141
00:53:35.433 --> 00:53:36.567
I can't believe he's gone.

1142
00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:39.400
Some best man I
turned out to be.

1143
00:53:41.867 --> 00:53:45.467
Ray. this was not your fault.

1144
00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:46.467
Yeah...

1145
00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:47.467
I'm so sorry.

1146
00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:50.233
I know he was your best friend.

1147
00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:55.233
You know. I always envied
Sterling. thought he had it all.

1148
00:53:55.367 --> 00:53:57.400
And the night
before the wedding.

1149
00:53:57.533 --> 00:53:59.467
oh. he's getting cold feet.

1150
00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:03.033
You think he'd have his
mind made up by then.

1151
00:54:03.166 --> 00:54:05.467
So what did he do?

1152
00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:08.967
Oh. he went out for
air after midnight.

1153
00:54:09.100 --> 00:54:11.133
Next thing I know. it's
morning and he's in full tux

1154
00:54:11.266 --> 00:54:13.367
ready to go to the church.

1155
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.633
Someone or something
changed his mind.

1156
00:54:28.767 --> 00:54:33.800
Well. it's not a
perfect dumpling.

1157
00:54:33.934 --> 00:54:37.633
Not exactly sure what it is.

1158
00:54:37.767 --> 00:54:38.834
I'll add parsley.

1159
00:54:38.967 --> 00:54:39.834
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1160
00:54:39.967 --> 00:54:40.934
Yeah.

1161
00:54:42.133 --> 00:54:43.033
Thanks for hanging
up on me. by the way.

1162
00:54:43.166 --> 00:54:44.033
You were distracting me.

1163
00:54:44.166 --> 00:54:45.467
You were going rogue.

1164
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:47.033
Do you wanna talk about
somebody going rogue?

1165
00:54:47.166 --> 00:54:48.033
Stick to our day jobs?

1166
00:54:48.166 --> 00:54:49.400
- Deal.
- Okay.

1167
00:54:52.500 --> 00:54:57.467
I think we're gonna need
something more than parsley.

1168
00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:02.200
Did he get cold feet?

1169
00:55:02.333 --> 00:55:04.567
Got the candle
holder right here.

1170
00:55:04.700 --> 00:55:05.667
Mm-hmm.

1171
00:55:07.166 --> 00:55:08.867
You still have some flour
on your face.

1172
00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.033
Hold on. you.

1173
00:55:16.500 --> 00:55:17.567
Thanks.

1174
00:55:17.700 --> 00:55:18.700
Yeah.

1175
00:55:24.567 --> 00:55:27.033
- Ray was jealous.
- Yeah.

1176
00:55:27.166 --> 00:55:29.300
Yeah. missing suitcase.

1177
00:55:31.834 --> 00:55:33.033
We need to find out what caused

1178
00:55:33.166 --> 00:55:34.934
Sterling's allergic reaction.

1179
00:55:35.066 --> 00:55:37.033
I did find an orange substance

1180
00:55:37.166 --> 00:55:38.133
in the back of Sterling's hand.

1181
00:55:38.266 --> 00:55:39.133
- Orange.
- Yeah.

1182
00:55:39.266 --> 00:55:40.133
You sure?

1183
00:55:40.266 --> 00:55:41.400
Oh. positive.

1184
00:55:41.533 --> 00:55:43.600
Because Ray had an orange
substance on his cast.

1185
00:55:43.734 --> 00:55:46.867
He said it was from
eating cassava crackers.

1186
00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.600
But cassava. it tastes nutty.

1187
00:55:48.734 --> 00:55:51.266
but it's not from the
nut family at all.

1188
00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.867
We need to talk to Chester.

1189
00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.667
Yeah. let's see...

1190
00:55:58.166 --> 00:56:00.433
Orange powder.

1191
00:56:00.567 --> 00:56:04.200
Wow. Chester's Realty
business is booming.

1192
00:56:05.567 --> 00:56:06.934
Yeah?

1193
00:56:07.066 --> 00:56:10.867
Someone's making a killing
commissions this month.

1194
00:56:13.567 --> 00:56:15.900
Wanna go house hunting?

1195
00:56:16.033 --> 00:56:17.033
Always.

1196
00:56:18.233 --> 00:56:22.700
Let's go.

1197
00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:34.367
- Nice house.
- Yeah.

1198
00:56:34.500 --> 00:56:36.867
Above my pay grade.
- Insane.

1199
00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.867
Let's
take a look around.

1200
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.033
Be back here in 20.

1201
00:56:45.166 --> 00:56:46.133
Okay.

1202
00:56:47.667 --> 00:56:50.033
- You back--
- Okay. I'll go this way then.

1203
00:56:50.166 --> 00:56:51.200
As you can see.

1204
00:56:51.333 --> 00:56:52.700
there's a spectacular
chef's kitchen.

1205
00:56:52.834 --> 00:56:56.767
newly renovated with
slide out shelves.

1206
00:56:56.900 --> 00:56:58.266
I'll let you folks
walk around though.

1207
00:56:58.400 --> 00:56:59.934
Let me know if you have
any questions. okay?

1208
00:57:00.133 --> 00:57:01.433
Thank you so much.

1209
00:57:01.567 --> 00:57:02.834
What a nice surprise.

1210
00:57:02.967 --> 00:57:04.600
I can see you working
your magic in here.

1211
00:57:04.734 --> 00:57:06.000
Oh. well.

1212
00:57:06.133 --> 00:57:07.934
Unless that magic
increases my bank account.

1213
00:57:08.066 --> 00:57:11.433
I think I'm gonna have
to stay put.

1214
00:57:11.567 --> 00:57:13.333
So what brings you by?

1215
00:57:13.467 --> 00:57:15.834
Oh. we're friends. right?

1216
00:57:16.967 --> 00:57:18.333
Of course.

1217
00:57:18.467 --> 00:57:20.600
I. I just needed to ask.

1218
00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:25.500
why didn't you come clean
about Sterling hitting you?

1219
00:57:25.633 --> 00:57:27.367
Because he didn't.

1220
00:57:28.734 --> 00:57:31.667
Chester. I know you
didn't get the black eye

1221
00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:34.567
playing basketball
like you said.

1222
00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:37.834
Sterling didn't hit me. Goldy.

1223
00:57:39.734 --> 00:57:41.266
He was fighting with
Ray in the parking lot

1224
00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:43.266
after the rehearsal
dinner ended.

1225
00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:45.000
And when the groomsman and
I went in to break them up .

1226
00:57:45.133 --> 00:57:47.033
my eye hit Ray's fist.

1227
00:57:48.567 --> 00:57:49.433
Sorry I lied.

1228
00:57:49.567 --> 00:57:51.600
I didn't wanna look suspicious.

1229
00:57:51.734 --> 00:57:54.433
Why was Sterling fighting
his best .an again?

1230
00:57:54.567 --> 00:57:55.433
I'm sorry. Goldy.

1231
00:57:55.567 --> 00:57:56.467
I have to work.

1232
00:57:59.567 --> 00:58:01.667
I want to find Jess too.

1233
00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:03.333
But what about Hoops for Teens?

1234
00:58:03.467 --> 00:58:04.567
If you're willing to
spend that much on Jess's

1235
00:58:04.700 --> 00:58:06.066
over the top wedding.

1236
00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.000
then why not put it towards
something more meaningful?

1237
00:58:08.133 --> 00:58:10.166
Now is not the time or place.

1238
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:12.834
When is the time. Dad?

1239
00:58:12.967 --> 00:58:14.500
I have done everything you asked

1240
00:58:14.633 --> 00:58:17.066
and kept it quiet
all these years.

1241
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.166
What's up fellas?

1242
00:58:19.300 --> 00:58:21.333
You. you kept what quiet?

1243
00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:24.000
I wouldn't have thought
this type of house

1244
00:58:24.133 --> 00:58:26.000
would interest you. Tom.

1245
00:58:26.133 --> 00:58:28.967
Well. lots of
things interest me.

1246
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.500
What are you doing here?

1247
00:58:31.633 --> 00:58:33.400
I happen to own this house.

1248
00:58:33.533 --> 00:58:35.166
This was supposed to
be Jessamyn listing.

1249
00:58:35.300 --> 00:58:37.500
but Chester has it now.

1250
00:58:37.633 --> 00:58:41.667
Well. why does it say
it's under Westco property?

1251
00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:43.400
Yes. it's one of
my holding companies.

1252
00:58:43.533 --> 00:58:44.500
Is that a problem?

1253
00:58:44.633 --> 00:58:45.900
It's not a problem. I just.

1254
00:58:46.033 --> 00:58:48.834
I'm just wondering
what the big secret is.

1255
00:58:48.967 --> 00:58:51.000
Did you happen to be
involved in the. in the.

1256
00:58:51.133 --> 00:58:53.166
in the failed software company?

1257
00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:56.400
This is sounding like
a police interrogation.

1258
00:58:56.533 --> 00:58:58.066
And you don't have
your badge. do you?

1259
00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:00.066
It's just a
friendly observation.

1260
00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:02.233
Well. I think it's
time for you to leave.

1261
00:59:04.867 --> 00:59:08.700
Okay. well. hey. good
luck with the listing.

1262
00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:21.233
I still think
Chester is hiding something.

1263
00:59:21.367 --> 00:59:24.400
but at least now we know how
and when Ray broke his hand.

1264
00:59:24.533 --> 00:59:25.734
we just don't know why.

1265
00:59:25.867 --> 00:59:27.066
Well. in my experience.

1266
00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.400
when two guys fight
after a few drinks.

1267
00:59:28.533 --> 00:59:30.400
it's usually over a woman.

1268
00:59:30.533 --> 00:59:31.967
And we still don't know
how Laurence and Hunter

1269
00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:33.467
fit into all of this.

1270
00:59:33.600 --> 00:59:35.567
And also. what is Hunter hiding?

1271
00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:36.967
Well. I think we're
getting close to the truth.

1272
00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:38.900
Based on Laurence's reaction.

1273
00:59:39.033 --> 00:59:40.967
Do you really think
that Laurence is involved

1274
00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:42.300
in all of this?

1275
00:59:42.433 --> 00:59:44.133
I think that if
he was an investor.

1276
00:59:44.266 --> 00:59:48.800
he sure didn't lose his
shirt like everybody else.

1277
00:59:48.934 --> 00:59:50.567
We need to get our hands
on the police records.

1278
00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:51.900
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1279
00:59:53.400 --> 00:59:54.734
What's the one thing that's
in abundance at weddings?

1280
00:59:54.867 --> 00:59:56.066
Puff pastry.

1281
00:59:56.200 --> 00:59:58.900
Puff. puff pastries?

1282
00:59:59.033 --> 01:00:01.066
Photos. Goldy. photos.

1283
01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.467
Oh. photos.

1284
01:00:02.600 --> 01:00:03.800
That's much better.

1285
01:00:03.934 --> 01:00:05.133
We need to talk
to the photographer.

1286
01:00:05.266 --> 01:00:06.233
Okay.

1287
01:00:07.367 --> 01:00:08.734
Yes.

1288
01:00:08.867 --> 01:00:11.066
Smile. show some teeth. yes.

1289
01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.066
Excuse me. hi.

1290
01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:14.900
You. you're early.

1291
01:00:16.433 --> 01:00:17.800
The station said a detective
would swing by later.

1292
01:00:17.934 --> 01:00:19.633
I'm in the middle
of a photo shoot.

1293
01:00:19.767 --> 01:00:20.967
He is the detective.

1294
01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.900
- I'm the detective.
- Yep.

1295
01:00:23.033 --> 01:00:24.967
Let's get it over with.
I'll pull up the files.

1296
01:00:28.867 --> 01:00:30.900
Oh man.

1297
01:00:31.033 --> 01:00:32.567
Breaks my heart a
little to see these.

1298
01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:35.300
You have to detach
yourself in an investigation.

1299
01:00:35.433 --> 01:00:37.400
Can't let it affect you.

1300
01:00:45.767 --> 01:00:51.133
Wait a second.

1301
01:00:51.266 --> 01:00:52.467
Hey. hey. hey.

1302
01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.066
Track is here.

1303
01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.066
We gotta hurry.

1304
01:00:58.867 --> 01:01:00.967
Look at. look at this.

1305
01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:02.200
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1306
01:01:02.333 --> 01:01:04.300
Is that sweet.
gentle Ann slapping

1307
01:01:04.433 --> 01:01:06.300
her soon to be son-in-law

1308
01:01:06.433 --> 01:01:08.967
the night before he was killed?

1309
01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.533
Get a picture.

1310
01:01:13.667 --> 01:01:17.533
Come on. close it out.

1311
01:01:17.667 --> 01:01:18.633
Thank you!

1312
01:01:18.767 --> 01:01:20.633
Thank you very much.

1313
01:01:32.266 --> 01:01:33.800
Hey. you got Ray.

1314
01:01:33.934 --> 01:01:35.633
Leave a message.

1315
01:01:35.767 --> 01:01:36.867
Ray. where are you?

1316
01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.266
We're starting.

1317
01:01:45.834 --> 01:01:53.633
I hope wherever Jess
is. she can feel the love.

1318
01:01:53.767 --> 01:01:55.300
- Let's find the crackers.
- No.

1319
01:01:55.433 --> 01:01:57.934
It is not the time.
- Yes.

1320
01:01:58.066 --> 01:01:58.967
Come on. come on.

1321
01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.367
Ann?

1322
01:02:00.500 --> 01:02:04.333
Um. this is the silliest
of questions. you know.

1323
01:02:05.834 --> 01:02:10.934
considering. but where did
you get these crackers?

1324
01:02:11.066 --> 01:02:16.567
I think from Hunter.
maybe. the bridal party.

1325
01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:17.567
I don't remember.

1326
01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.200
Would you. would you like some?

1327
01:02:19.333 --> 01:02:21.367
That would. yes.
that would be great.

1328
01:02:21.500 --> 01:02:25.033
It's always good to learn about
new snacks for parties and--

1329
01:02:25.166 --> 01:02:26.200
Events.

1330
01:02:26.333 --> 01:02:27.700
Charcuterie boards and...

1331
01:02:27.834 --> 01:02:30.266
- We were throwing parties.
- I am. so many parties.

1332
01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.100
Well. I think you'll
like these then.

1333
01:02:32.233 --> 01:02:34.266
They're cassava and cheddar.

1334
01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.433
They're the only things

1335
01:02:35.567 --> 01:02:36.867
that would settle
Laurence's stomach.

1336
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.333
I got it. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1337
01:02:43.233 --> 01:02:45.934
Ann. after the
rehearsal dinner.

1338
01:02:46.066 --> 01:02:48.033
you met Sterling
in the hotel foyer.

1339
01:02:48.166 --> 01:02:51.233
What exactly did you say to him?

1340
01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:52.266
I don't recall.

1341
01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.567
It was a busy day.

1342
01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.700
Oh.

1343
01:02:58.166 --> 01:03:01.600
I don't mean to make
you uncomfortable.

1344
01:03:01.734 --> 01:03:05.767
but you slapped him.

1345
01:03:08.967 --> 01:03:13.700
Timestamped at 12:05 AM.

1346
01:03:17.734 --> 01:03:21.166
I. I I think what Tom is.

1347
01:03:21.300 --> 01:03:26.433
is trying to say is we
would understand if you had

1348
01:03:26.567 --> 01:03:28.433
resentment towards
Sterling's family.

1349
01:03:28.567 --> 01:03:31.266
I mean. after all. you.
you lost your house.

1350
01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.333
Gosh. no.

1351
01:03:32.467 --> 01:03:35.266
That's. that's ancient history.

1352
01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.667
I mean. yeah. it was hard.

1353
01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:41.433
Some people didn't get over
it. but many of us did.

1354
01:03:41.567 --> 01:03:43.166
I mean. look at Jess and Katie.

1355
01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.333
Katie?

1356
01:03:44.467 --> 01:03:47.600
Well. she and Sterling
were once engaged.

1357
01:03:47.734 --> 01:03:49.433
Well. Katie moved on.

1358
01:03:49.567 --> 01:03:51.934
Her dad never forgave Sterling's
family after almost losing

1359
01:03:52.066 --> 01:03:55.834
his farm for investing
in that stupid startup.

1360
01:03:55.967 --> 01:03:58.266
I'm. I'm sorry. I didn't know

1361
01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:01.834
that Sterling and
Katie were engaged.

1362
01:04:01.967 --> 01:04:03.600
Didn't last long.

1363
01:04:05.467 --> 01:04:07.333
I think Katie broke it off with
Sterling after she followed

1364
01:04:07.467 --> 01:04:08.834
him to San Francisco.

1365
01:04:08.967 --> 01:04:10.066
I mean. her dad would've
never given his blessing.

1366
01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.667
but it all worked
out in the end.

1367
01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:16.767
She met Ray and my Jess
ended up with Sterling.

1368
01:04:17.967 --> 01:04:19.900
So why were you
so mad at Sterling?

1369
01:04:20.033 --> 01:04:22.834
He said he was gonna
call off the wedding

1370
01:04:22.967 --> 01:04:25.000
and I wouldn't let him do that.

1371
01:04:25.133 --> 01:04:27.500
So yes. I lost my temper.

1372
01:04:27.633 --> 01:04:30.000
but I set him straight
because I'll do anything

1373
01:04:30.133 --> 01:04:31.000
for my daughter.

1374
01:04:31.133 --> 01:04:32.166
Anything at all.

1375
01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:34.233
Why didn't you
tell us this before?

1376
01:04:34.367 --> 01:04:37.467
Because it wasn't
my finest moment.

1377
01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:42.667
Ann. I. uh...

1378
01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.166
What's going on?

1379
01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.066
Ann. what's happening?

1380
01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.300
They find Jess?

1381
01:04:48.433 --> 01:04:49.333
No.

1382
01:04:49.467 --> 01:04:50.567
No.

1383
01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:52.567
What did you do
to upset my wife?

1384
01:04:52.700 --> 01:04:54.000
I've asked her some
questions. Laurence.

1385
01:04:54.133 --> 01:04:56.967
You know. I've just
about had enough outta you.

1386
01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.000
Now get outta here.

1387
01:04:58.133 --> 01:04:59.000
Stay away from my family.

1388
01:04:59.133 --> 01:05:00.066
- We're gonna go.
- Yeah.

1389
01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:01.100
We are leaving.

1390
01:05:01.233 --> 01:05:04.233
Thank you.

1391
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.600
He gets in a fight with Ray.

1392
01:05:11.734 --> 01:05:14.367
Chester stands to
get Whitetail Realty.

1393
01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:17.600
and then Hunter
stands to inherit.

1394
01:05:17.734 --> 01:05:19.700
Ann slap Sterling

1395
01:05:19.834 --> 01:05:23.367
and also she might
be responsible for
the orange crackers.

1396
01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.533
So what am I looking at?

1397
01:05:24.667 --> 01:05:26.367
I tried to recreate
Anne's crackers.

1398
01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:29.200
Both she and Ray said
that they were cassava.

1399
01:05:29.333 --> 01:05:30.700
but they're not.

1400
01:05:30.834 --> 01:05:32.533
So I whipped together
three different recipes.

1401
01:05:32.667 --> 01:05:36.834
I need you to try 'em.
starting with her original.

1402
01:05:38.233 --> 01:05:39.867
Huh?

1403
01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.834
Now try the corn flour.

1404
01:05:45.834 --> 01:05:46.867
It's not that one.

1405
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.166
Cauliflower.

1406
01:05:52.166 --> 01:05:53.700
Not it either.

1407
01:05:53.834 --> 01:05:57.333
No. try the one in the middle.

1408
01:06:00.467 --> 01:06:01.333
It's that one.

1409
01:06:01.467 --> 01:06:02.333
- Yeah.
- That's it.

1410
01:06:02.467 --> 01:06:03.600
- Yeah.
- What is it?

1411
01:06:03.734 --> 01:06:04.700
Avocado.

1412
01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.667
- Okay. What does that mean?
- It means someone is lying.

1413
01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:09.433
They're not cassava crackers.

1414
01:06:09.567 --> 01:06:10.834
And the interesting
thing is that people

1415
01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.166
with tree nut
allergies. a lot of them

1416
01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:15.266
are severely
allergic to avocados.

1417
01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:16.600
So Sterling was likely exposed

1418
01:06:16.734 --> 01:06:18.600
to the allergen around 9:00 AM.

1419
01:06:18.734 --> 01:06:21.600
And I am willing to bet
that someone saw something.

1420
01:06:21.734 --> 01:06:24.100
Well. outside of
security cameras.

1421
01:06:24.233 --> 01:06:26.266
what's the next best way
to get eyes on people?

1422
01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:30.166
Spy glasses.

1423
01:06:30.300 --> 01:06:32.333
Loitering teenagers
on skateboards.

1424
01:06:32.467 --> 01:06:33.333
- That's better.
- Mm.

1425
01:06:33.467 --> 01:06:34.433
Yeah.

1426
01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:45.100
There he is.

1427
01:06:45.233 --> 01:06:46.767
Mom. promise you
won't embarrass me.

1428
01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:47.867
What. me?

1429
01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:52.767
Okay. fine.

1430
01:06:52.900 --> 01:06:54.600
All right. you stay in the car.

1431
01:06:54.734 --> 01:06:56.367
We'll be right back.

1432
01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:07.233
Hey Lucas. I'm
Goldy. Olive's mom.

1433
01:07:07.367 --> 01:07:10.400
And this is my friend Tom.

1434
01:07:10.533 --> 01:07:11.834
What's up?

1435
01:07:11.967 --> 01:07:13.033
I know who he is.

1436
01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:14.066
We can skateboard here.

1437
01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.333
No one said we couldn't.

1438
01:07:15.467 --> 01:07:16.433
Relax. relax.

1439
01:07:16.567 --> 01:07:17.500
We're just trying to
figure out what happened

1440
01:07:17.633 --> 01:07:19.667
to Sterling Bridgewater.

1441
01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:23.667
Yeah. have you seen anything
suspicious the last few days?

1442
01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:26.500
Nope. I already told the cops.

1443
01:07:26.633 --> 01:07:28.667
Lucas. it's. it's okay.

1444
01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:32.166
You can trust Tom and
my mom's the best.

1445
01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:33.834
And you can trust me.

1446
01:07:33.967 --> 01:07:37.767
If there's anything you
know. just tell them.

1447
01:07:39.867 --> 01:07:41.166
Morning of. I was
grinding with my board

1448
01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:42.233
somewhere I shouldn't have.

1449
01:07:42.367 --> 01:07:44.500
Please don't tell my mom.

1450
01:07:44.633 --> 01:07:46.066
And I saw the groom.

1451
01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:47.667
He was like arguing with the
bride before she kissed him

1452
01:07:47.800 --> 01:07:49.166
and he sort of pushed her away.

1453
01:07:49.300 --> 01:07:50.834
and she kinda like
fell backwards.

1454
01:07:50.967 --> 01:07:52.033
So what?

1455
01:07:52.166 --> 01:07:54.667
So you saw the bride
and groom together

1456
01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:55.734
the morning of the wedding.

1457
01:07:55.867 --> 01:07:57.000
Most definitely.

1458
01:07:57.133 --> 01:08:00.233
She was in a fancy dress
with a jacket that said

1459
01:08:00.367 --> 01:08:03.734
"besties" on it with flowers.
and he had on his tux.

1460
01:08:03.867 --> 01:08:04.734
So.

1461
01:08:04.867 --> 01:08:06.233
What time was that?

1462
01:08:06.367 --> 01:08:07.433
9:00. 10:00 ish.

1463
01:08:07.567 --> 01:08:10.066
You know what they
were arguing about?

1464
01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:11.734
No. I tailed
straight past 'em.

1465
01:08:11.867 --> 01:08:14.467
Can you take us to
where that happened?

1466
01:08:17.166 --> 01:08:18.166
Thank you.

1467
01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:24.900
It was here.

1468
01:08:25.033 --> 01:08:27.066
After he pushed her. the
groom walked that way.

1469
01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:28.400
Bride was on the ground

1470
01:08:28.533 --> 01:08:30.800
but she was like alive
and everything. so.

1471
01:08:30.934 --> 01:08:32.400
Okay.

1472
01:08:32.533 --> 01:08:34.333
Okay. thank you Lucas.

1473
01:08:36.533 --> 01:08:40.400
Mom. is it okay if me and
Lucas walk back to the van?

1474
01:08:43.533 --> 01:08:45.066
Sure.

1475
01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:46.600
Yeah. Yeah.

1476
01:08:46.734 --> 01:08:48.800
But go directly to the van and
text me when you get there.

1477
01:08:48.934 --> 01:08:49.900
Okay.

1478
01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:55.967
I'm not a cool mom.

1479
01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:58.567
All right. so the
morning of the wedding.

1480
01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:01.200
Jess and Sterling come out here.

1481
01:09:01.333 --> 01:09:03.633
Emotions are running high.

1482
01:09:03.767 --> 01:09:06.867
they had a big fight
the night before.

1483
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.700
So maybe they come out to talk.

1484
01:09:09.834 --> 01:09:10.967
Okay.

1485
01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:14.700
Jess. she goes in.
she goes to kiss him.

1486
01:09:17.266 --> 01:09:19.800
Then he uh. pushes her.

1487
01:09:19.934 --> 01:09:21.900
Right. she goes down.

1488
01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:26.300
Sterling had an orangey
rash in the back of his hand.

1489
01:09:26.433 --> 01:09:31.133
What do you do when you wanna
wipe a kiss off your face?

1490
01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:34.967
What are we missing?

1491
01:09:41.333 --> 01:09:45.200
Rental car keys.

1492
01:09:45.333 --> 01:09:47.700
Jessamyn would never rent a car.

1493
01:09:47.834 --> 01:09:49.934
She's always chauffeured.

1494
01:09:51.333 --> 01:09:55.133
Something tells me this
car is parked at the hotel.

1495
01:10:07.266 --> 01:10:08.867
Go to the hotel.
- Okay.

1496
01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:09.967
Schultz.

1497
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.367
What's up. Track?

1498
01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.967
Let's go.

1499
01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.467
Under Colorado law
section 18-81-12

1500
01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:17.800
I'm arresting you
for class six felony.

1501
01:10:17.934 --> 01:10:20.133
offense of a impersonating
police officer.

1502
01:10:20.266 --> 01:10:21.800
You're making a big mistake.

1503
01:10:21.934 --> 01:10:23.033
No.

1504
01:10:23.166 --> 01:10:24.700
No. Tom. you did
when you interfered

1505
01:10:24.834 --> 01:10:26.633
in an active investigation
under suspension

1506
01:10:26.767 --> 01:10:31.200
as the prime suspect and posed
as a cop to a photographer.

1507
01:10:31.333 --> 01:10:33.467
That's a mouthful. isn't it?

1508
01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.800
Let's go.

1509
01:10:35.934 --> 01:10:37.233
I'll be okay.

1510
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.266
Yeah. there's a $300
charge on my credit card

1511
01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.700
I never authorized.

1512
01:11:44.834 --> 01:11:47.100
She was in a fancy
dress with a jacket

1513
01:11:47.233 --> 01:11:48.867
that said "besties" on it.

1514
01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.033
She and Sterling
were once engaged.

1515
01:11:51.166 --> 01:11:52.600
Well. Katie moved on.

1516
01:11:52.734 --> 01:11:54.767
Her dad never forgave
Sterling's family

1517
01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:56.200
after almost losing his farm

1518
01:11:56.333 --> 01:11:58.600
investing in that
stupid startup.

1519
01:11:58.734 --> 01:12:01.100
There's nothing more
important than love.

1520
01:12:01.233 --> 01:12:02.100
Never take it for granted.

1521
01:12:02.233 --> 01:12:04.433
because it could be too late.

1522
01:12:14.767 --> 01:12:17.200
Detective. the last call
Sterling made was to Jess

1523
01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.700
before he dropped the cell

1524
01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:20.767
according to a fall
detection alert software.

1525
01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:21.800
And...

1526
01:12:24.767 --> 01:12:26.800
Why is Tom here?

1527
01:12:26.934 --> 01:12:28.033
Well. our
suspect's in custody.

1528
01:12:28.166 --> 01:12:30.367
He just needs to
confess her whereabouts.

1529
01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:33.200
We have new evidence that
could help us crack both cases.

1530
01:12:33.333 --> 01:12:35.300
Shut it down. Kildea.

1531
01:12:41.934 --> 01:12:42.800
Hey.

1532
01:12:42.934 --> 01:12:44.300
Hey.

1533
01:12:44.433 --> 01:12:45.700
So just got back from
Whitetail. like you asked.

1534
01:12:45.834 --> 01:12:47.467
I compared what you found
at the land registry

1535
01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.300
to the MLS listings.

1536
01:12:49.433 --> 01:12:51.467
And guess who bought most
of the defaulted properties

1537
01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.633
after Sterling's
families skipped town?

1538
01:12:53.767 --> 01:12:55.133
- Westco Realty.
- Mm-hmm.

1539
01:12:55.266 --> 01:12:57.133
Laurence gave out a
lot of private loans

1540
01:12:57.266 --> 01:12:59.300
for business owners to
save their properties.

1541
01:12:59.433 --> 01:13:01.266
So Tom's hunch about
Laurence was right.

1542
01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.767
He was involved with a startup

1543
01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:04.367
and there's something
he's not saying.

1544
01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:07.367
But it doesn't matter because
I think I know who did it.

1545
01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.934
You think this is gonna work?

1546
01:13:09.066 --> 01:13:10.700
Only if Jess is alive. but
we know how small towns work.

1547
01:13:10.834 --> 01:13:12.867
We tell one person. one
thing. and before we know it.

1548
01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.400
it gets all over town and
flushes out the killer.

1549
01:13:16.533 --> 01:13:17.433
Hopefully.

1550
01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.700
- Detective?
- Mm?

1551
01:13:44.834 --> 01:13:46.033
A witness has come
forward with new evidence

1552
01:13:46.166 --> 01:13:48.367
on the Sterling murder.

1553
01:13:48.500 --> 01:13:50.767
What witness. what evidence?

1554
01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:53.700
They only wanna
speak with you.

1555
01:13:55.467 --> 01:13:56.367
I'm Detective Track.

1556
01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:58.100
Hi.

1557
01:13:58.233 --> 01:13:59.600
- You.
- Hmm.

1558
01:13:59.734 --> 01:14:02.500
Before we begin.
I'm a little parched.

1559
01:14:02.633 --> 01:14:03.500
Can I have some water?

1560
01:14:03.633 --> 01:14:05.000
Sure. sparkling or still?

1561
01:14:05.133 --> 01:14:06.000
Oh.

1562
01:14:06.133 --> 01:14:07.667
I. I'll get it.

1563
01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.734
Well. thank you Mason.

1564
01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:16.500
Hey.

1565
01:14:16.633 --> 01:14:19.100
What took you so long?

1566
01:14:19.233 --> 01:14:21.567
I went as fast as I could.

1567
01:14:25.233 --> 01:14:26.433
Mason.

1568
01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.333
Okay.
what's going on?

1569
01:14:30.467 --> 01:14:31.934
What. what is this?

1570
01:14:32.066 --> 01:14:35.433
Well. I've got some
new evidence for you.

1571
01:14:35.567 --> 01:14:37.266
You've been barking up
the wrong tree. Davy.

1572
01:14:37.400 --> 01:14:38.600
Have a seat.

1573
01:14:38.734 --> 01:14:40.600
This might take a while.

1574
01:14:40.734 --> 01:14:43.166
It's a miracle. Jess escaped.

1575
01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:45.600
We are meeting at
Elk Park Hotel lobby.

1576
01:15:13.633 --> 01:15:14.900
Where's Jess?

1577
01:15:15.033 --> 01:15:16.333
Is she okay?

1578
01:15:16.467 --> 01:15:18.734
I don't know. she
hasn't shown up yet.

1579
01:15:46.300 --> 01:15:47.333
Goldy?

1580
01:15:47.467 --> 01:15:49.000
Where's Jess?

1581
01:15:49.133 --> 01:15:51.066
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1582
01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:52.500
Everybody else
is at the hotel.

1583
01:15:52.633 --> 01:15:56.333
but you came here
because you wanted to see

1584
01:15:56.467 --> 01:15:58.834
if Jess had actually escaped.

1585
01:15:59.867 --> 01:16:04.066
So where is she?

1586
01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.400
How'd you figure it out?

1587
01:16:06.533 --> 01:16:10.133
There was a witness who
saw Jess and Sterling kissing

1588
01:16:10.266 --> 01:16:12.567
the morning of their wedding.

1589
01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:14.467
But someone as
superstitious as Jess

1590
01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:18.400
would never see the
groom before her wedding.

1591
01:16:20.867 --> 01:16:24.400
It was you who was kissing
and arguing with Sterling

1592
01:16:24.533 --> 01:16:27.667
after you had eaten
avocado crackers.

1593
01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:32.967
And after you kissed
him. he pushed you away.

1594
01:16:39.266 --> 01:16:40.567
You lost your keys.

1595
01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:44.400
which is why Ray was
charged for an extra set.

1596
01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:46.133
This whole time.

1597
01:16:46.266 --> 01:16:49.066
you have been in
love with Sterling.

1598
01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:51.233
You heard him. Goldy.

1599
01:16:51.367 --> 01:16:53.066
he talked about
getting back together.

1600
01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.400
He wasn't serious. Katie.

1601
01:16:54.533 --> 01:16:57.233
I know that now but
between that and hearing

1602
01:16:57.367 --> 01:16:59.233
he had cold feet. I...

1603
01:17:00.433 --> 01:17:05.433
I thought he wanted me back.

1604
01:17:05.567 --> 01:17:06.467
Where's Jess?

1605
01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.567
What did you do to her?

1606
01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:13.367
Sterling called her to
confess that I kissed him.

1607
01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:17.900
He was sorry for having
doubts and fighting with her.

1608
01:17:19.433 --> 01:17:20.967
But Jess went off on me.

1609
01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:24.133
She was gonna tell Ray.

1610
01:17:24.266 --> 01:17:25.967
I don't even remember
what happened next.

1611
01:17:28.667 --> 01:17:31.033
Jess was on the floor and I.

1612
01:17:31.166 --> 01:17:32.967
I was holding a
bloody candle holder.

1613
01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:34.133
So you panicked.

1614
01:17:34.266 --> 01:17:37.734
Instead of coming clean.
you kidnapped her.

1615
01:17:39.266 --> 01:17:41.700
You brought her somewhere here.

1616
01:17:41.834 --> 01:17:45.633
I saw the mud and the
hay on your tires.

1617
01:17:45.767 --> 01:17:48.400
You planted her phone. her book.

1618
01:17:51.934 --> 01:17:53.700
You had everyone thinking
there were cassava crackers.

1619
01:17:53.834 --> 01:17:57.300
You. you. you spread rumors
about Tommy. he lost his badge.

1620
01:17:57.433 --> 01:17:59.367
I. I didn't know what to do.

1621
01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.867
Did you just decide that
since you can't have him

1622
01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.600
then no one else can?

1623
01:18:03.734 --> 01:18:05.934
No. I didn't know
people with nut allergies

1624
01:18:06.066 --> 01:18:09.033
could have a problem
with avocados.

1625
01:18:10.734 --> 01:18:13.767
I only fund out later.

1626
01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:15.533
Well. unfortunately.
it was too late. Katie.

1627
01:18:21.166 --> 01:18:24.367
Oh!

1628
01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:35.367
Put that down. drop it.

1629
01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.700
Got it.

1630
01:18:40.834 --> 01:18:43.433
Katie. where's Jessamyn?

1631
01:18:43.567 --> 01:18:45.200
I'm done talking.

1632
01:18:48.166 --> 01:18:49.533
Look. she could be anywhere.

1633
01:18:49.667 --> 01:18:51.200
I. I used to play hide
and secret with Katie

1634
01:18:51.333 --> 01:18:55.867
on this farm when we were little
and I would never find her.

1635
01:19:04.567 --> 01:19:08.333
Jess.

1636
01:19:08.467 --> 01:19:12.667
Jess?

1637
01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.600
Jess.

1638
01:19:15.734 --> 01:19:16.600
Jess.
- Jess.

1639
01:19:16.734 --> 01:19:17.734
Tommy!

1640
01:19:19.734 --> 01:19:20.633
Jess!

1641
01:19:20.767 --> 01:19:22.266
Tommy. I'm here!

1642
01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:25.266
- Jess. we're coming.
- We're coming in.

1643
01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.600
- Here.
- Okay.

1644
01:19:31.066 --> 01:19:34.934
Hurry up!

1645
01:19:36.233 --> 01:19:37.600
Jess. it's okay!
It's okay.

1646
01:19:37.734 --> 01:19:38.867
Hey. you okay?

1647
01:19:40.066 --> 01:19:42.433
Oh. Jess!

1648
01:19:42.567 --> 01:19:46.767
Where's Sterling?

1649
01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:47.934
Where's my mom?

1650
01:19:48.066 --> 01:19:50.066
You're safe now. Jess.

1651
01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.600
Wait.

1652
01:19:52.734 --> 01:19:55.767
You were actually gonna
wear that to my wedding?

1653
01:20:00.233 --> 01:20:01.667
A hamburger is not a sandwich.

1654
01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.100
It is the literal
definition of sandwich.

1655
01:20:04.233 --> 01:20:06.266
Bread. meat. bread.

1656
01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:08.100
That is not how this works.
- Sandwich.

1657
01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:15.266
- We should go.
- Yeah. okay.

1658
01:20:29.133 --> 01:20:31.266
What's gonna happen to Katie?

1659
01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.100
She's gonna be charged.

1660
01:20:34.233 --> 01:20:36.934
But hopefully she gets
the help that she needs.

1661
01:20:37.066 --> 01:20:38.266
It's so sad.

1662
01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:44.767
You know. all she never wanted
was to love and be loved.

1663
01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:46.433
Thomas.

1664
01:20:46.567 --> 01:20:47.934
Hey.

1665
01:20:48.066 --> 01:20:52.200
I. I just wanna thank you
both for bringing Jess back.

1666
01:20:53.967 --> 01:20:55.000
And I want to apologize.

1667
01:20:55.133 --> 01:20:56.934
No. no need. Laurence.

1668
01:20:57.066 --> 01:20:59.500
- No. no. no.
- It's okay. I misjudged you.

1669
01:20:59.633 --> 01:21:02.166
I should have said
something back in New York

1670
01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:04.834
when I discovered that
Sterling's dad's startup

1671
01:21:04.967 --> 01:21:06.967
was a scam. but I didn't.

1672
01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:12.000
Anyway. thanks again.

1673
01:21:12.133 --> 01:21:13.500
You're welcome.

1674
01:21:23.467 --> 01:21:25.500
Oh man.

1675
01:21:30.533 --> 01:21:31.834
Schultz.

1676
01:21:31.967 --> 01:21:33.500
Track.

1677
01:21:33.633 --> 01:21:38.667
I was told to uh. apologize.

1678
01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:42.333
So this is me apologizing.

1679
01:21:42.467 --> 01:21:46.333
You've been reinstated.

1680
01:21:46.467 --> 01:21:50.834
I don't know how you two
did it. but case is closed.

1681
01:21:50.967 --> 01:21:56.000
We did it because Goldy and
I make a really good team.

1682
01:21:57.533 --> 01:21:59.166
Jess is under medical
evaluation. but I
got her statement.

1683
01:21:59.300 --> 01:22:00.800
Boy. did she have a lot to say.

1684
01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:05.734
Hey.

1685
01:22:05.867 --> 01:22:08.400
I should be mad.
but I'll let it slide

1686
01:22:08.533 --> 01:22:12.467
since he did what I would've
done. break a few rules.

1687
01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:14.133
No hard feelings then?

1688
01:22:14.266 --> 01:22:15.800
Oh. there's definitely
hard feelings.

1689
01:22:15.934 --> 01:22:20.233
Sheriff put you on traffic
duty for the next month.

1690
01:22:21.533 --> 01:22:23.967
Sorry. Mason.

1691
01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:26.567
So does this mean
you'll be staying in town?

1692
01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:28.967
Depends if hamburgers make
it on your sandwich board.

1693
01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:30.233
Oh.

1694
01:22:30.367 --> 01:22:33.066
You'll have to stick
around to find out.

1695
01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:34.900
Can I give you a lift?

1696
01:22:35.033 --> 01:22:36.333
Yeah. thanks.

1697
01:22:39.033 --> 01:22:43.133
Hah!

1698
01:22:49.433 --> 01:22:55.633
I don't know how
I feel about that.

1699
01:22:55.767 --> 01:22:58.467
Goldy. I wanna thank you.

1700
01:22:58.600 --> 01:22:59.734
You don't need to thank--

1701
01:22:59.867 --> 01:23:02.567
No. no. I do
need to thank you.

1702
01:23:03.934 --> 01:23:05.467
You never once stopped
believing in me.

1703
01:23:10.934 --> 01:23:15.800
Goldy. will you...

1704
01:23:15.934 --> 01:23:18.633
Go out on a date with me?

1705
01:23:18.767 --> 01:23:22.734
If your plate has any
room left on it. that is.

1706
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.133
You know what you
feel like when you have

1707
01:23:26.266 --> 01:23:29.567
the really big meal
and you are so full

1708
01:23:30.934 --> 01:23:33.133
that you couldn't
possibly eat another bite.

1709
01:23:33.266 --> 01:23:36.033
but then you make
room for dessert?

1710
01:23:36.166 --> 01:23:39.734
Are you suggesting
that I'm the dessert?

1711
01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:45.033
Because I'm. I'm okay with that.

1712
01:23:47.934 --> 01:23:51.633
I'm gonna hold you to
it. okay. Ms. Berry?

1713
01:23:51.767 --> 01:23:52.734
Okay.
