3
00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:38.304
Do you. Alice.

4
00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:41.340
take Joseph...

5
00:01:41.375 --> 00:01:44.343
to be your husband

6
00:01:44.378 --> 00:01:48.842
in sickness and in health...

7
00:01:48.877 --> 00:01:52.846
until distance do you part?

8
00:01:55.224 --> 00:01:57.785
I do.

9
00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.722
And do you. Joseph.

10
00:02:00.757 --> 00:02:06.266
take Alice to be your wife...

11
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:10.468
in sickness
and in health

12
00:02:10.503 --> 00:02:14.703
until distance do you part?

13
00:02:14.738 --> 00:02:16.507
I do.

14
00:02:18.775 --> 00:02:22.381
I now pronounce you...

15
00:02:22.416 --> 00:02:25.714
man and wife.

16
00:02:29.786 --> 00:02:31.489
Joseph!

17
00:02:31.524 --> 00:02:33.293
Joseph!

18
00:02:34.824 --> 00:02:36.593
Joseph!

19
00:02:48.035 --> 00:02:52.345
The Lord has decided
that he needed to test us.

20
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.251
-Mr. Paul?
-The deed has been done.

21
00:02:59.013 --> 00:03:01.552
It wasn't a rabbit.

22
00:03:01.587 --> 00:03:04.357
You arrogance blinded you.
Joseph.

23
00:03:04.392 --> 00:03:06.920
We'll note it for Sunday.

24
00:03:09.023 --> 00:03:11.298
Now grab one end.

25
00:03:24.577 --> 00:03:27.710
He said.
"If you will diligently listen

26
00:03:27.745 --> 00:03:30.482
to the voice of the Lord.
your God.

27
00:03:30.517 --> 00:03:34.915
and do that
which is right in His eyes...

28
00:03:36.754 --> 00:03:40.789
...give ears to His commands
and keep all His statutes.

29
00:03:40.824 --> 00:03:43.561
I will put none
of the diseases on you

30
00:03:43.596 --> 00:03:45.431
that I put on the Egyptians...

31
00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.932
...for I am the Lord.
your healer."

32
00:04:08.984 --> 00:04:11.556
Mr. Paul.
Mr. Paul!

33
00:04:11.591 --> 00:04:12.722
Mr. Paul!
I caught a rat!

34
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.472
Don't even think
about helping him up.

35
00:04:26.507 --> 00:04:28.001
He did this on his own.

36
00:04:28.036 --> 00:04:31.004
He can get up on his own.

37
00:04:43.755 --> 00:04:46.822
Y'all heard him.
Get back to work!

38
00:04:46.857 --> 00:04:48.791
Back to work.

39
00:04:51.433 --> 00:04:53.367
Back to work. boy.

40
00:05:04.413 --> 00:05:06.446
-Hold still.

41
00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.752
Ruthie?

42
00:05:15.787 --> 00:05:18.392
You can't be sneaking over here
and playing like this.

43
00:05:18.427 --> 00:05:19.954
As the oldest woman
in this bunch.

44
00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:22.154
I think I can do just about
anything I want to do.

45
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.531
And right now.
I want to see my son.

46
00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:34.133
Best not to hear
those stories tonight. Alice.

47
00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:35.970
Her reading's
the only thing we got.

48
00:05:39.547 --> 00:05:42.449
We can't keep doing this.

49
00:05:42.484 --> 00:05:44.946
We thank keep letting Mr. Paul
do what he wants.

50
00:05:46.686 --> 00:05:48.950
It's a choice
we don't have to make.

51
00:05:48.985 --> 00:05:51.018
If any one of us
start acting up.

52
00:05:51.053 --> 00:05:52.756
you know what would happen?

53
00:05:52.791 --> 00:05:54.087
We'd all die.

54
00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.432
There's 12 of us.

55
00:05:58.467 --> 00:06:00.665
There's one of him.

56
00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.635
Three if you count
Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Aaron.

57
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.132
Not all of us had the teaching
from Mr. Paul you had.

58
00:06:06.167 --> 00:06:07.738
How?

59
00:06:07.773 --> 00:06:10.741
The men that hunt runaways
work at night.

60
00:06:10.776 --> 00:06:13.106
We've all heard the stories.

61
00:06:13.141 --> 00:06:15.647
I ain't never heard of them
hunting in the day.

62
00:06:15.682 --> 00:06:17.077
It won't work. Alice.

63
00:06:17.112 --> 00:06:20.014
She ain't wrong
for thinking about it.

64
00:06:20.049 --> 00:06:23.655
None of us are.

65
00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:26.053
There's got to be
something else.

66
00:06:26.088 --> 00:06:28.957
A bunch of white men
out there waiting...

67
00:06:28.992 --> 00:06:32.059
to kill us. keep us. or sell us.

68
00:06:33.128 --> 00:06:34.930
I need to speak to my wife.

69
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.504
Alone.

70
00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.110
-Joseph. this place --
-Paul knows.

71
00:06:51.212 --> 00:06:54.653
About us.

72
00:06:54.688 --> 00:06:56.787
About everything.

73
00:08:02.019 --> 00:08:04.085
No. my brothers and sisters!

74
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.561
This was no messenger from God.

75
00:08:07.596 --> 00:08:11.224
This was a warning
from the devil himself.

76
00:08:14.834 --> 00:08:18.605
Even in our gracious state
of Georgia...

77
00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.168
on God-given land.

78
00:08:21.203 --> 00:08:24.875
the devil has ways
of sending an emissary.

79
00:08:26.879 --> 00:08:31.882
He said. "You must continue
to be fruitful.

80
00:08:33.688 --> 00:08:38.053
Not only for yourselves.
but for your domestic livestock.

81
00:08:38.088 --> 00:08:42.321
for they. too. must be bathed
in the bounty of birth.

82
00:08:44.798 --> 00:08:47.326
Or I will...

83
00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:51.198
take it all away."

84
00:09:11.792 --> 00:09:14.056
I need to have
a word with you.

85
00:09:36.014 --> 00:09:40.951
How long has it been
since we lost your beloved?

86
00:09:45.353 --> 00:09:47.287
Long time ago.

87
00:09:52.129 --> 00:09:55.097
I've always tried my best
to take care of you.

88
00:09:55.132 --> 00:09:56.769
Haven't I?

89
00:10:05.142 --> 00:10:07.373
You want to be inside.
Is that it?

90
00:10:11.214 --> 00:10:12.917
No. sir.

91
00:10:12.952 --> 00:10:14.721
A home life.

92
00:10:16.384 --> 00:10:19.286
This is what you're longing for.
isn't it?

93
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:23.730
When your wife passed...
I should've married you off.

94
00:10:25.096 --> 00:10:28.394
Could have had sons
working by your side.

95
00:10:29.364 --> 00:10:31.001
Mr. Paul. I --

96
00:10:31.036 --> 00:10:32.739
Our neighbor. Brother Levi.

97
00:10:32.774 --> 00:10:36.171
has offered one of his domestics
to be your bride.

98
00:10:42.146 --> 00:10:44.245
I'm happy. Mr. Paul.

99
00:10:45.754 --> 00:10:48.788
I-I work hard.
I-I don't need --

100
00:10:48.823 --> 00:10:51.824
The message was clear.
You need to be fruitful.

101
00:10:51.859 --> 00:10:53.892
Along with
the other domestics.

102
00:10:53.927 --> 00:10:57.390
This -- This is a big thing
Brother Levi is doing for us.

103
00:10:58.833 --> 00:11:01.163
He hasn't been as blessed
with his domestics.

104
00:11:05.136 --> 00:11:07.268
We've agreed
that the first child

105
00:11:07.303 --> 00:11:10.403
will rightfully go to him.

106
00:11:12.946 --> 00:11:16.882
You'll leave this week to...

107
00:11:19.183 --> 00:11:21.150
...to procreate.

108
00:11:22.857 --> 00:11:25.055
And then. when the pregnancy
is confirmed.

109
00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:27.189
you can return.

110
00:11:38.565 --> 00:11:42.237
This is so much bigger
than -- than us.

111
00:11:57.925 --> 00:12:01.322
Daniel's coming home tomorrow.

112
00:12:01.357 --> 00:12:03.159
MRS.
And Rachel.

113
00:12:07.836 --> 00:12:10.529
She's been gone a long time now.

114
00:12:13.138 --> 00:12:15.435
Your mind's not
what it used to be. Mother.

115
00:12:27.383 --> 00:12:29.152
It's Sunday.

116
00:12:49.878 --> 00:12:51.273
I said it's Sunday.

117
00:12:57.050 --> 00:12:58.819
I know.

118
00:13:01.285 --> 00:13:02.515
You go on ahead of me.

119
00:13:06.323 --> 00:13:08.961
What about Mrs. Bennett?

120
00:13:10.657 --> 00:13:13.064
Ruth can put her to bed.

121
00:14:57.005 --> 00:14:59.269
Nobody said you could sit there.

122
00:15:18.026 --> 00:15:19.718
You think you look like this?

123
00:15:23.163 --> 00:15:25.196
I just looked at the picture.

124
00:15:25.231 --> 00:15:26.626
I didn't...

125
00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:30.201
You don't read good enough
to understand...

126
00:15:30.236 --> 00:15:32.500
the meaning. Alice.

127
00:15:35.439 --> 00:15:37.307
I-I only taught you

128
00:15:37.342 --> 00:15:41.410
so you could read to me
as a domestic.

129
00:15:41.445 --> 00:15:43.544
Understand?

130
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:48.120
Understand?

131
00:15:48.155 --> 00:15:49.484
Yes.

132
00:15:49.519 --> 00:15:50.749
Good.

133
00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.390
Sit.

134
00:15:57.758 --> 00:15:59.362
On the bed.

135
00:16:39.107 --> 00:16:41.272
Have you ever thought
about running away?

136
00:16:42.008 --> 00:16:46.046
Pondering is only
gonna make you feel worse.

137
00:16:49.381 --> 00:16:51.480
Have you ever thought about it?

138
00:16:53.484 --> 00:16:55.286
We don't --
We don't talk about that.

139
00:16:55.321 --> 00:16:57.684
I didn't ask
if we talked about it.

140
00:16:57.719 --> 00:17:00.357
I asked you
if you thought about it.

141
00:17:06.167 --> 00:17:08.860
Used to.

142
00:17:08.895 --> 00:17:13.337
But I just chose
not to see things

143
00:17:13.372 --> 00:17:14.866
out of my control.

144
00:17:14.901 --> 00:17:18.738
That kind of thinking
will get you killed.

145
00:17:20.577 --> 00:17:23.512
You ever hear stories
about anyone making it out?

146
00:17:28.321 --> 00:17:29.749
Your granddaddy...

147
00:17:32.622 --> 00:17:36.723
...once said he -- he saw a man.

148
00:17:43.336 --> 00:17:45.336
One of us.

149
00:17:48.473 --> 00:17:50.341
As if...

150
00:17:50.376 --> 00:17:53.674
As if he just fell from the sky.

151
00:17:59.385 --> 00:18:01.847
Could start a fire
with his hands.

152
00:18:06.359 --> 00:18:08.128
Mm-hmm.

153
00:18:13.234 --> 00:18:15.399
He's still out there.

154
00:18:16.666 --> 00:18:19.403
My daddy...

155
00:18:19.438 --> 00:18:23.440
buried him over in that --
in that corral.

156
00:18:24.075 --> 00:18:29.182
Strangest-looking man
he'd ever seen.

157
00:18:30.977 --> 00:18:32.746
-Did you see him?
-Oh. no. I wasn't --

158
00:18:32.781 --> 00:18:34.781
I wasn't trying to.

159
00:19:39.045 --> 00:19:42.981
What are you doing?
What are you doing. son?

160
00:19:43.016 --> 00:19:44.884
What are you --

161
00:20:47.487 --> 00:20:49.751
We can fix those.

162
00:20:52.756 --> 00:20:54.624
You like your schoolin'?

163
00:20:57.398 --> 00:21:00.465
Well. I'll bet you have
a lot of friends.

164
00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.830
Not really.

165
00:21:02.865 --> 00:21:05.932
Well. you know what that means.

166
00:21:05.967 --> 00:21:08.000
You're a smarter person.

167
00:21:08.035 --> 00:21:11.476
They don't understand you.

168
00:21:11.511 --> 00:21:13.610
A man is rich
not by what he owns.

169
00:21:13.645 --> 00:21:15.843
but by what he can do without.

170
00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:22.850
Mrs. Bennett awake?

171
00:21:22.885 --> 00:21:25.358
Mm-hmm.
She's in the sitting room.

172
00:21:25.393 --> 00:21:27.987
Well. get her.
Her grandson's home.

173
00:21:29.991 --> 00:21:31.562
Hi. Mr. Daniel.

174
00:21:33.060 --> 00:21:34.697
Hi.

175
00:21:37.768 --> 00:21:40.505
You hungry?

176
00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:43.838
Make something
for me and my boy.

177
00:21:59.427 --> 00:22:01.526
Can't you see?

178
00:23:17.934 --> 00:23:19.967
Mrs. Bennett.

179
00:23:20.002 --> 00:23:21.705
Mrs. --

180
00:23:24.611 --> 00:23:26.105
I was a dancer. you know.

181
00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:28.613
In Chicago.

182
00:23:31.651 --> 00:23:34.553
Mrs. Bennett...

183
00:23:34.588 --> 00:23:36.522
what's out there?

184
00:23:36.557 --> 00:23:39.250
The whole world.

185
00:23:39.285 --> 00:23:41.758
Don't you see it?

186
00:24:06.884 --> 00:24:09.082
I found this.

187
00:24:09.117 --> 00:24:11.183
What is it?

188
00:24:11.218 --> 00:24:14.527
Something from somewhere.

189
00:24:14.562 --> 00:24:17.057
Someone from someplace.

190
00:24:17.928 --> 00:24:19.796
Who?

191
00:24:19.831 --> 00:24:21.996
Someone like us.

192
00:24:22.031 --> 00:24:24.933
There's more than we know...

193
00:24:24.968 --> 00:24:26.902
more than we can see.

194
00:24:29.973 --> 00:24:32.039
We have to go.

195
00:24:32.074 --> 00:24:33.876
-I don't know.
-We'll go.

196
00:24:33.911 --> 00:24:37.275
If we make it out.
we come back for everyone

197
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:39.145
and burn this place
to the ground.

198
00:24:42.249 --> 00:24:44.018
Aaron's got a gun.

199
00:24:44.053 --> 00:24:46.185
You let me worry about that.

200
00:24:55.702 --> 00:24:57.570
What if...

201
00:24:59.838 --> 00:25:02.641
What if there's nothing
out there?

202
00:25:03.644 --> 00:25:06.073
I'll take my chances.

203
00:25:07.241 --> 00:25:09.175
Will you?

204
00:25:11.751 --> 00:25:13.146
Yes.

205
00:25:15.150 --> 00:25:17.084
Wait for my signal.

206
00:25:26.293 --> 00:25:28.161
"There's a strange land yonder.

207
00:25:28.196 --> 00:25:33.067
a land of witchcraft
and beautiful things.

208
00:25:33.102 --> 00:25:36.235
a land of brave people."

209
00:25:46.082 --> 00:25:47.818
-I got this. Daddy.
-Hmm?

210
00:25:48.689 --> 00:25:50.854
"What is the good of..."

211
00:25:51.989 --> 00:25:55.386
"What is the good of talking?

212
00:25:55.421 --> 00:25:58.323
It grows dark.

213
00:25:58.358 --> 00:26:02.129
Those who live to see will see.

214
00:26:02.164 --> 00:26:05.770
'You need not fear me.
Macumazahn.'

215
00:26:05.805 --> 00:26:08.773
he said. interpreting my look."

216
00:26:12.009 --> 00:26:13.338
Mr. Aaron!

217
00:26:16.882 --> 00:26:20.279
"I dig no holes
for you to fall in.

218
00:26:20.314 --> 00:26:21.687
I make no plots."

219
00:26:21.722 --> 00:26:23.084
You're crazy!

220
00:26:23.119 --> 00:26:25.251
-What you want. boy?
-I caught a rabbit.

221
00:26:25.519 --> 00:26:28.892
Oh.
Well...show me.

222
00:26:31.798 --> 00:26:34.293
-"I-If we..."

223
00:26:37.298 --> 00:26:41.201
"If ever we are..."

224
00:26:41.236 --> 00:26:43.841
Get inside.
Keep reading.

225
00:26:54.722 --> 00:26:56.821
-No!

226
00:26:58.858 --> 00:27:00.187
Go! Go!

227
00:27:00.222 --> 00:27:02.024
Go! Run!

228
00:27:02.059 --> 00:27:04.092
Go! Run! Go!

229
00:27:04.127 --> 00:27:05.456
Don't stop!
Don't stop!

230
00:27:05.491 --> 00:27:06.897
Go!

231
00:27:06.932 --> 00:27:08.800
-Go! Go!

232
00:27:08.835 --> 00:27:10.065
Run!

233
00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:13.167
Run! Go!
Run!

234
00:27:13.202 --> 00:27:15.070
Go!

235
00:27:28.085 --> 00:27:30.118
Mr. Paul!

236
00:27:30.153 --> 00:27:32.252
I got him. Mr. Paul!

237
00:27:45.399 --> 00:27:48.136
Mr. Paul!

238
00:27:48.171 --> 00:27:50.171
Mr. Paul. I got him!

239
00:27:50.206 --> 00:27:53.108
I got him!
I got him!

240
00:27:53.143 --> 00:27:55.880
Mr. Paul.
Mr. Paul!

241
00:27:55.915 --> 00:27:59.246
I got him!
I got him! I got him!

242
00:28:04.121 --> 00:28:05.989
I think he's gone.

243
00:28:08.422 --> 00:28:11.324
All I ever tried to do...

244
00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:15.130
was protect you.

245
00:28:15.165 --> 00:28:17.396
Now. you go look.

246
00:28:18.399 --> 00:28:20.267
You go look...

247
00:28:20.302 --> 00:28:26.471
and you see
what betrayal looks like.

248
00:28:26.506 --> 00:28:28.209
You go look!

249
00:28:48.099 --> 00:28:51.397
What do you say I have Moses
make you some new toys?

250
00:28:51.432 --> 00:28:53.806
I want to go home.

251
00:29:44.056 --> 00:29:47.090
Alice. I want you
to sit with us.

252
00:29:50.997 --> 00:29:52.931
Sit!

253
00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:02.138
Looks good.
Don't you think. Daniel?

254
00:30:10.247 --> 00:30:11.950
Mm.

255
00:30:11.985 --> 00:30:14.249
Alice is a good cook.

256
00:30:29.662 --> 00:30:32.234
Be a shame to lose her.

257
00:30:56.161 --> 00:30:58.326
Stop!

258
00:30:58.361 --> 00:30:59.624
Shut your mouth!

259
00:30:59.659 --> 00:31:02.495
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

260
00:31:03.729 --> 00:31:06.301
Stop! Stop! Stop!

261
00:31:08.569 --> 00:31:11.471
Stop! Stop! Stop!

262
00:31:32.758 --> 00:31:34.362
Help me!

263
00:31:38.170 --> 00:31:39.433
Use the scold's bridle.

264
00:31:39.468 --> 00:31:40.401
No!

265
00:31:40.436 --> 00:31:42.469
No! No! No! No!

266
00:31:42.504 --> 00:31:44.075
No!

267
00:31:44.110 --> 00:31:45.978
You stop!

268
00:31:46.013 --> 00:31:47.111
Stop!

269
00:31:47.146 --> 00:31:50.180
What did I do to deserve this?!

270
00:31:50.215 --> 00:31:52.281
What did I do?!

271
00:31:55.187 --> 00:31:57.187
I really liked you. Alice.

272
00:31:57.222 --> 00:31:58.650
I really liked you!

273
00:32:02.161 --> 00:32:03.490
No!

274
00:34:30.441 --> 00:34:33.211
I want to move past this. Alice.

275
00:34:49.658 --> 00:34:52.395
The greatest gift
God gave to man

276
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:54.364
was forgiveness.

277
00:37:24.615 --> 00:37:26.648
Aah!

278
00:38:03.687 --> 00:38:04.851
Miss?

279
00:38:04.886 --> 00:38:05.984
Miss?

280
00:38:06.019 --> 00:38:07.557
Miss. can you hear me?

281
00:38:07.592 --> 00:38:09.460
Miss? Miss. you got --

282
00:38:09.495 --> 00:38:10.758
Miss --

283
00:38:10.793 --> 00:38:11.957
Be cool. man!

284
00:38:11.992 --> 00:38:13.530
Miss?!

285
00:38:13.565 --> 00:38:15.763
Miss?

286
00:38:15.798 --> 00:38:17.732
Miss...

287
00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:27.478
<i>Don't give him no peace sign</i>

Be cool!
Be cool.

00:39:00.678 --> 00:39:01.776
Listen.
Be cool.

302
00:39:04.748 --> 00:39:06.649
Be cool.
Ma'am...

303
00:39:06.684 --> 00:39:07.815
-Be cool.

304
00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:11.555
Be cool. Hey.
Hey. relax.

305
00:39:11.590 --> 00:39:13.150
Do you remember?
You fainted.

306
00:39:13.185 --> 00:39:16.626
I couldn't leave you out there.

307
00:39:16.661 --> 00:39:19.024
How did you get free?

308
00:39:19.059 --> 00:39:21.191
<i>When reality's all gone?</i>

309
00:39:21.226 --> 00:39:23.468
Free?

310
00:39:23.503 --> 00:39:25.569
What is this?!

311
00:39:25.604 --> 00:39:26.867
Hey. hey.
Hey!

312
00:39:26.902 --> 00:39:28.198
Don't -- Don't touch that.

313
00:39:28.233 --> 00:39:29.738
No. don't -- don't --

314
00:39:29.773 --> 00:39:32.609
Hold up. now.
Don't touch that door.

315
00:39:32.644 --> 00:39:35.876
You must've hit your head
real hard.

316
00:39:35.911 --> 00:39:37.449
<i>Eyes to the facts</i>

317
00:39:37.484 --> 00:39:39.517

Do you --
Do you know you in George?

320
00:39:47.252 --> 00:39:50.693
You do?

321
00:39:50.728 --> 00:39:53.960
Do you know it's 1973.

322
00:39:53.995 --> 00:39:57.469
<i>Oh. right on</i>

323
00:39:57.504 --> 00:39:59.933
As far as I'm concerned.
we went back 10 years

324
00:39:59.968 --> 00:40:02.540
with that jive ass
Nixon in office.

325
00:40:02.575 --> 00:40:04.938
You can go back?

326
00:40:04.973 --> 00:40:06.511
Oh. nah.

327
00:40:06.546 --> 00:40:08.480
Hell.
that would be slick.

328
00:40:15.687 --> 00:40:18.754
Air Force?

329
00:40:18.789 --> 00:40:22.186
Say.
that's an old Zippo.

330
00:40:22.221 --> 00:40:23.924
You know
what this is?

331
00:40:23.959 --> 00:40:26.157
Yeah. it's a lighter.
Let me see it.

332
00:40:26.192 --> 00:40:28.599
<i>Yet you stay locked</i>

333
00:40:28.634 --> 00:40:31.162

That your family?

336
00:40:33.969 --> 00:40:36.937
Uh. I have to get
out of this --

337
00:40:40.074 --> 00:40:42.811
Miss. there's napkins
in that glove compartment.

338
00:40:44.914 --> 00:40:46.782
There's napkins there.
Get the napkin--

339
00:40:56.563 --> 00:40:57.859
I'm sorry.

340
00:40:57.894 --> 00:40:59.223
I didn't m-mean to.

341
00:41:00.259 --> 00:41:01.863
It's okay.

342
00:41:03.702 --> 00:41:05.966
It's all right.
It's okay.

343
00:41:12.106 --> 00:41:15.008
I'm gonna let you
off up the ways.

344
00:41:15.043 --> 00:41:18.748
There's a hospital
right up there.

345
00:41:18.783 --> 00:41:20.651
They can
take care of you.

346
00:41:45.810 --> 00:41:47.612
Come on.

347
00:41:47.647 --> 00:41:49.746
I can't leave
this truck here.

348
00:41:52.850 --> 00:41:55.587
The people inside.
they're gonna help you.

349
00:42:12.067 --> 00:42:13.770
Excuse me.

350
00:42:13.805 --> 00:42:15.739
I picked up this woman
on the highway.

351
00:42:15.774 --> 00:42:17.708
-She fell.
-Okay.

352
00:42:17.743 --> 00:42:21.173
She might have amnesia. I
don't know.

353
00:42:21.208 --> 00:42:23.241
So. she must've hit her head
or something.

354
00:42:23.276 --> 00:42:26.277
-When she fainted?
-Yeah.

355
00:42:26.312 --> 00:42:28.884
Where is she?

356
00:42:28.919 --> 00:42:30.655
Shit.

357
00:42:33.957 --> 00:42:35.726
Hey.

358
00:42:35.761 --> 00:42:38.960
You can't be wondering off.
I'm trying to help you.

359
00:42:38.995 --> 00:42:41.732
Is she sick?

360
00:42:41.767 --> 00:42:43.063
Yeah.

361
00:42:43.098 --> 00:42:45.296
Probably.

362
00:42:45.331 --> 00:42:48.233
Is she free?

363
00:42:48.268 --> 00:42:50.675
Free from what?

364
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:52.644
Her owner.

365
00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:58.947
Uh...

366
00:42:58.982 --> 00:43:01.378
W-We -- We need to go

Rolling stone?

370
00:43:37.482 --> 00:43:39.350
You're saying
she has no recollection of time?

371
00:43:39.385 --> 00:43:40.758
That's right.

372
00:43:40.793 --> 00:43:42.221
And what's
your relationship to her?

373
00:43:42.256 --> 00:43:45.191
No relation.
I picked her up on the highway.

374
00:43:45.226 --> 00:43:47.160
Miss?

375
00:43:47.195 --> 00:43:48.799
You can go now. sir.

Okay. Alice.

Miss?
I heard you had a fall.

382
00:44:05.114 --> 00:44:07.147
-Yes. ma'am.
-You have a headache?

383
00:44:07.182 --> 00:44:08.720
Any pain?

00:44:08.755 --> 00:44:10.315
Well. I'm gonna need you

Last name?

391
00:44:23.902 --> 00:44:26.265
I don't have one.

392
00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:28.102

I don't know yet.

396
00:44:41.249 --> 00:44:43.150
What does that mean?

397
00:44:43.185 --> 00:44:45.482
It means
you're going someplace nice.

398
00:45:14.117 --> 00:45:15.886

Did anybody see her?

If you're not of kin.

406
00:45:39.505 --> 00:45:41.340

Taking me
someplace nice.

414

There ain't
no place nice.

Not where

H-How do you know

Now. let's go.

Come on.

426
00:46:37.662 --> 00:46:41.598
How do I know
you're not the bad one?

427
00:46:41.633 --> 00:46:45.008
Look. I know what they do
to people in the sanatorium.

428
00:46:45.043 --> 00:46:47.373
It where they take you
and drill your brain out.

429
00:46:47.408 --> 00:46:51.014
Was you in one?

430
00:46:51.049 --> 00:46:53.412
No!

431
00:46:53.447 --> 00:46:55.920
Somebody close
to me was.

432
00:46:59.255 --> 00:47:02.487
And they died there.

433
00:47:02.522 --> 00:47:04.456
I'm sorry.

434
00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.264
My husband died.

You ain't kill him.

Whose domestics
are those?

438

Domestics?

439
00:48:26.012 --> 00:48:28.243
Those people work
for my brother.

440
00:48:28.278 --> 00:48:30.443
It was the family business.

441
00:48:30.478 --> 00:48:32.280
What the hell
have you been?

442
00:48:32.315 --> 00:48:35.085
You realize
you three hours late. right?

443
00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:38.352
Everything is not about you.
Frank.

444
00:48:38.387 --> 00:48:39.683
Who's that?

445
00:48:39.718 --> 00:48:41.289
Look. if you're trying
to get another one

446
00:48:41.324 --> 00:48:43.126
of your friends a job.
the answer's no.

447
00:48:43.161 --> 00:48:45.722
-Be cool. man.
-Never again.

448
00:48:45.757 --> 00:48:47.658
You understand?

449
00:48:47.693 --> 00:48:51.035
Tomorrow...
finish the reports

450
00:48:51.070 --> 00:48:52.663
and be on time. okay?

451
00:49:03.478 --> 00:49:04.708
Is that your brother?

452
00:49:04.743 --> 00:49:06.512
Yeah.

453
00:49:26.798 --> 00:49:29.535
You embarrassed by me?

454
00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:31.603
Nah.

455
00:49:31.638 --> 00:49:34.111
I'm embarrassed by him.

456
00:49:43.650 --> 00:49:46.057
It's not much.

457
00:49:46.092 --> 00:49:49.819
It was my mom's
old place.

458
00:49:49.854 --> 00:49:51.491
I'll get you something
to sleep in.

459
00:49:51.526 --> 00:49:54.164
and we can figure out
everything in the morning.

460
00:49:59.732 --> 00:50:01.501
You're hungry?

461
00:50:05.177 --> 00:50:07.375
Is that
your cold closet?

462
00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:09.179
My what?

463
00:50:12.184 --> 00:50:14.679
You like bologna?

464
00:50:16.122 --> 00:50:17.451
Bologna?

465
00:50:17.486 --> 00:50:18.716
Mm-hmm.

466
00:50:23.294 --> 00:50:25.063
Little mustard. too.

467
00:50:32.402 --> 00:50:34.270
It's good.

468
00:50:34.305 --> 00:50:36.239
Try it.

469
00:50:45.613 --> 00:50:48.350
It's salty.

470
00:50:48.385 --> 00:50:50.484
It's mustard.

471
00:50:52.191 --> 00:50:53.751
Mustard...

472
00:50:55.755 --> 00:50:58.228
You can eat
as much as you want.

473
00:51:02.168 --> 00:51:03.794
Do you have some milk?

474
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:06.401
Blackberry juice okay?

475
00:51:08.471 --> 00:51:10.405
<i>We were told that only</i>
<i>white people were beautiful.</i>

476

<i>They're proud of it.</i>

479
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:19.282
<i>And white people</i>
<i>are aware of it. too.</i>

480
00:51:19.317 --> 00:51:21.680
<i>because white people</i>
<i>now want natural wigs.</i>

481
00:51:21.715 --> 00:51:23.253
<i>They want wigs like this.</i>

482
00:51:23.288 --> 00:51:25.321
<i>Dig it?</i>
<i>Isn't it beautiful?</i>

483
00:51:25.356 --> 00:51:26.619
-Yes.
<i>-All right.</i>

484
00:51:26.654 --> 00:51:28.225
<i>They say Superwoman.</i>

485
00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.688
<i>I think they get me</i>
<i>confused with --</i>

486
00:51:29.723 --> 00:51:31.426
<i>They think I've been</i>
<i>in "Cleopatra Jones"</i>

00:51:31.461 --> 00:51:32.625
<i>and some of these</i>
<i>super woman films...</i>

488
00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:33.923
That's Pam Grier.

489
00:51:33.958 --> 00:51:36.365
She the baddest
chick around.

They're not inside.

497

-Oh. come on. man.

You know she had to know.

672
01:05:38.538 --> 01:05:39.768
I don't think
neither one of them

673
01:05:39.803 --> 01:05:40.769
would have anything
to do with that.

674
01:05:40.804 --> 01:05:42.111
Oh. come on.

675
01:05:42.146 --> 01:05:44.641

You didn't have
to make me nothing.

I wanted to.

680
01:06:16.345 --> 01:06:17.740

681
01:06:22.813 --> 01:06:25.550
Listen.

682

We got to figure out
what you have to do.

683
01:06:30.623 --> 01:06:34.394
Maybe some woman's home
or some place

684
01:06:34.429 --> 01:06:35.791
they can help you
get your memory back.

685
01:06:35.826 --> 01:06:37.397
I haven't lost
my memory.

686
01:06:37.432 --> 01:06:40.565
-You may think --
-I haven't lost my memory.

687
01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:44.701
I know exactly who I am
and where I came from.

01:06:44.736 --> 01:06:47.374
These books told me.

689
01:06:50.709 --> 01:06:53.611
Who are you then?

690
01:06:53.646 --> 01:06:55.580
I'm me.

691
01:06:55.615 --> 01:06:57.813
I know. Alice.
I know you Alice.

692
01:06:57.848 --> 01:07:00.090
But who are you?

693
01:07:00.125 --> 01:07:03.687
My whole life's
been a lie. Frank.

694
01:07:03.722 --> 01:07:05.590
Not just part.

695
01:07:05.625 --> 01:07:08.461
Not the kind of lies

696
01:07:08.496 --> 01:07:10.760
people tell themselves
to get by.

697
01:07:12.599 --> 01:07:15.204
The whole thing.

698
01:07:15.239 --> 01:07:17.173
So. who are you?

699
01:07:21.344 --> 01:07:23.773
I was a slave. Frank.

700
01:07:25.645 --> 01:07:27.447
Do you...

701
01:07:27.482 --> 01:07:28.811
Do you know what
you're saying?

702
01:07:28.846 --> 01:07:30.483
Do you?

703
01:07:30.518 --> 01:07:33.255
I know exactly
what I'm saying.

704
01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:36.390
No. do you? Do you really know
what you're saying right now?

705
01:07:38.658 --> 01:07:41.395
Listen.

706
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:44.662
Alice. I need you
to tell me who you really are

707
01:07:44.697 --> 01:07:48.567
-or whoever it is --
-I just told you who I was.

708
01:07:48.602 --> 01:07:50.371
Alice...

709
01:07:53.706 --> 01:07:56.674
You need to get somebody
that can help you.

710
01:07:56.709 --> 01:08:00.150
Why can't you help me?

711
01:08:00.185 --> 01:08:02.416
Because I'm nobody.

712
01:08:34.714 --> 01:08:36.813
I'm meeting somebody
tomorrow.

713
01:08:38.685 --> 01:08:40.487
Somebody...

714
01:08:40.522 --> 01:08:41.917
I knew.

715
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:48.693
That's -- That's good.

716
01:08:48.728 --> 01:08:50.266
That's...

717
01:08:50.301 --> 01:08:51.861
That's great.

718
01:08:55.438 --> 01:08:56.602
You...

719
01:08:56.637 --> 01:08:58.571
You want me to take you?

720
01:09:00.674 --> 01:09:02.443
I'd like that.

727
01:09:31.870 --> 01:09:34.277
<i>No love to shield me</i>

<i>Through the mirror of my mind</i>

731
01:09:43.783 --> 01:09:46.355
<i>Through these tears</i>
<i>that I'm crying</i>

732
01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:50.326
<i>Reflects a hurt I can't control</i>

733
01:09:50.361 --> 01:09:52.394
<i>'Cause although you're gone</i>

734
01:09:52.429 --> 01:09:55.331
<i>I keep holding on</i>

735
01:09:55.366 --> 01:09:57.366
<i>To the happy times</i>

736
01:09:57.401 --> 01:10:00.831
<i>Ooh. when you were mine</i>

737
01:10:00.866 --> 01:10:03.372
<i>As I peer through the window</i>

738
01:10:03.407 --> 01:10:05.605
<i>Of lost time</i>

739
01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:07.838
<i>Looking over my yesterdays</i>

740
01:10:07.873 --> 01:10:13.008
<i>And all the love</i>
<i>I gave all in vain</i>

741
01:10:13.043 --> 01:10:14.746
<i>All the love</i>

742
01:10:14.781 --> 01:10:17.980
<i>All the love that I've wasted</i>

743
01:10:18.015 --> 01:10:19.619
<i>All the tears</i>

744
01:10:19.654 --> 01:10:22.886
<i>All the tears that I've tasted</i>

745
01:10:22.921 --> 01:10:30.333
<i>All in vain</i>

746
01:10:30.368 --> 01:10:32.731
<i>Through the hollow of my tears</i>

747
01:10:32.766 --> 01:10:35.470
<i>I see a dream that's lost</i>

748
01:10:35.505 --> 01:10:37.670
<i>From the hurt</i>

749
01:10:37.705 --> 01:10:40.035
<i>That you have caused</i>

750
01:10:40.070 --> 01:10:42.444
<i>Everywhere I turn</i>

751
01:10:42.479 --> 01:10:44.908
<i>Seems like everything I see</i>

752
01:10:44.943 --> 01:10:48.714
<i>Reflects the love</i>
<i>that used to be</i>

753
01:10:48.749 --> 01:10:50.947
<i>In you I put</i>

754
01:10:50.982 --> 01:10:53.719
<i>All my faith and trust</i>

755
01:10:53.754 --> 01:10:55.457
<i>Right before my eyes</i>

756
01:10:55.492 --> 01:10:57.426
It's<i> Rolling Stone.</i>

757
01:11:00.497 --> 01:11:01.991
How do I look?

758
01:11:02.026 --> 01:11:04.433
Like you.

759
01:11:04.468 --> 01:11:06.501
<i>Just a handful of promises</i>

760
01:11:06.536 --> 01:11:11.506
<i>Are all that's left</i>
<i>of loving you</i>

761
01:11:11.541 --> 01:11:13.409
<i>All the love</i>

762
01:11:13.444 --> 01:11:16.775
<i>All the love that I've wasted</i>

763
01:11:16.810 --> 01:11:18.414
<i>All the tears</i>

764
01:11:18.449 --> 01:11:21.648
<i>All the tears that I've tasted</i>

765
01:11:21.683 --> 01:11:25.685
<i>All in vain</i>

766
01:11:32.562 --> 01:11:35.464
You gonna be okay
going to see your friend?

767
01:11:35.499 --> 01:11:37.862
She was never my friend.

768
01:11:37.897 --> 01:11:39.930
She ain't your friend?

769
01:11:39.965 --> 01:11:41.998
That's right.

770
01:11:42.033 --> 01:11:43.406
How does that work?

771
01:11:43.441 --> 01:11:45.375
Just does.

772
01:11:47.445 --> 01:11:48.972
You need me to come with you?

773
01:11:49.007 --> 01:11:50.545
No.

774
01:12:01.459 --> 01:12:03.723
Sit anywhere you want.

775
01:12:14.835 --> 01:12:16.703
Just you?

776
01:12:16.738 --> 01:12:18.705
I'm waiting on somebody.

777
01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.135
Coffee?

778
01:12:42.896 --> 01:12:45.930
I-I'm looking for someone.
a woman.

779
01:12:45.965 --> 01:12:47.536
There's
a lot of women here.

780
01:12:47.571 --> 01:12:50.099
A Negro woman.

781
01:12:50.134 --> 01:12:53.201
-Take it easy.
-Take care.

782
01:12:53.236 --> 01:12:55.808
Alice.

783
01:12:55.843 --> 01:12:57.480
You look so different.

784
01:12:57.515 --> 01:12:59.075
You don't.

785
01:13:07.591 --> 01:13:10.460
Self-seating.

786
01:13:10.495 --> 01:13:12.088
Sweetie. turn that down.

787
01:13:13.564 --> 01:13:15.663
He's obsessed with that thing.

788
01:13:17.502 --> 01:13:20.998
I hid it in his suitcase
when he went to see Paul.

789
01:13:21.033 --> 01:13:22.604
Any coffee?

790
01:13:22.639 --> 01:13:24.474
I'm shocked he didn't find it.

791
01:13:24.509 --> 01:13:25.541
I heard it.

792
01:13:25.576 --> 01:13:27.070
I'm hungry. Alice.

793
01:13:27.105 --> 01:13:29.644
I'm not here to serve you.

794
01:13:31.208 --> 01:13:34.011
Why don't you go
check out that machine

795
01:13:34.046 --> 01:13:36.915
while mommy talks. okay?

796
01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:38.081
Alice --

797
01:13:38.116 --> 01:13:39.918
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

798
01:13:39.953 --> 01:13:42.525
You should never
have been afraid.

799
01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.792
We always wanted
to provide a safe place

800
01:13:45.827 --> 01:13:48.058
for our domestics.

801
01:13:48.093 --> 01:13:49.158
Yes.

802
01:13:49.193 --> 01:13:50.863
That includes discipline.

803
01:13:50.898 --> 01:13:53.701
But every home
needs structure.

804
01:13:53.736 --> 01:13:57.969
Life before people got confused
about their place.

805
01:13:58.004 --> 01:14:00.675
and it was
a lot less hard --

806
01:14:00.710 --> 01:14:03.942
I was never confused.

807
01:14:03.977 --> 01:14:05.614
I was lied to.

808
01:14:05.649 --> 01:14:06.945
You blame me?

809
01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:09.112
I always thought of you
as family.

810
01:14:09.147 --> 01:14:12.049
Stop with the lies.
Rachel.

811
01:14:12.084 --> 01:14:15.118
My family died
so yours could leave.

812
01:14:15.153 --> 01:14:16.922
I am not the devil.
Alice.

813
01:14:16.957 --> 01:14:19.859
No. the devil got to you
long before you left.

814
01:14:19.894 --> 01:14:21.828
-I am learning every --
-Enough.

815
01:14:21.863 --> 01:14:24.127
Why'd you ask me here
if I can't talk?

816
01:14:24.162 --> 01:14:26.701
Because this whole thing.

817
01:14:26.736 --> 01:14:29.165
me sitting
across from you.

818
01:14:29.200 --> 01:14:31.871
this ain't about<i> you.</i>

819
01:14:31.906 --> 01:14:33.906
This is about me

820
01:14:33.941 --> 01:14:35.237
seeing you

821
01:14:35.272 --> 01:14:39.043
for exactly what you are.

822
01:14:39.078 --> 01:14:42.981
Outside of that backwards world
I was born into to believe

823
01:14:43.016 --> 01:14:45.654
-you were actually somebody.
-Alice --

824
01:14:45.689 --> 01:14:49.185
I thought if I could see you
out in the open.

825
01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:51.726
It might stop me
from thinking about hunting down

826
01:14:51.761 --> 01:14:54.124
and doing something to make sure
you never forget my name.

827
01:14:54.159 --> 01:14:56.159
-Watch it. Alice.
-But Daniel

828
01:14:56.194 --> 01:14:58.227
needs at least one parent.

829
01:14:58.262 --> 01:14:59.228
Alice!

830
01:14:59.263 --> 01:15:02.770
I'm not scared.

831
01:15:02.805 --> 01:15:04.838
And that should
scare you --

832
01:15:04.873 --> 01:15:06.708
-Alice!
-Shut the hell up!

833
01:15:06.743 --> 01:15:08.809
It's my turn now.

834
01:15:08.844 --> 01:15:11.108
You left us there to die.

835
01:15:11.143 --> 01:15:13.979
You watched us
get tormented.

836
01:15:14.014 --> 01:15:16.047
And you thought
I wanted to meet up with you

837
01:15:16.082 --> 01:15:19.149
just to hear you talk.

838
01:15:19.184 --> 01:15:21.657
I don't give a damn
about your life.

839
01:15:21.692 --> 01:15:23.285
Freedom...

840
01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:26.057
is something you will never
understand in a million years.

841
01:15:27.159 --> 01:15:29.159
I<i> am</i> freedom.

842
01:15:29.194 --> 01:15:30.831
Daniel! Daniel!

843
01:15:30.866 --> 01:15:32.833
-Alice.
-Frank?

844
01:15:32.868 --> 01:15:34.703
Daniel. come.
Come.

845
01:15:34.738 --> 01:15:36.166
-Y'all need to leave.
-Alice. wait. Wait. Alice.

846
01:15:36.201 --> 01:15:37.365
Hey. hey. hey.
You got a bill.

847
01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:44.812
-What about Alice?
-Get in the car right now!

848
01:15:44.847 --> 01:15:48.244
Rachel!

849
01:15:48.279 --> 01:15:49.278
Don't...

850
01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.151
You let them get away!
Go to hell!

851
01:15:55.385 --> 01:15:58.089
Alice...

852
01:16:01.864 --> 01:16:03.358
I have to go back.

853
01:16:03.393 --> 01:16:05.800
Nah. you can't go back.
What you talking about?

854
01:16:05.835 --> 01:16:07.329
You know what will happen
to you?

855
01:16:07.364 --> 01:16:10.772
Everybody that's ever
cared about me is still there.

856
01:16:12.072 --> 01:16:13.808
I got to get them out.

857
01:16:16.043 --> 01:16:18.406
I'm'a need some more books.

858
01:17:25.013 --> 01:17:27.112
<i>What would you do?</i>
<i>Kill all of them?</i>

859
01:17:27.147 --> 01:17:30.412
<i>Well. why not? Nothing</i>
<i>else seems to do any good.</i>

860
01:17:30.447 --> 01:17:33.756
<i>You know who they are.</i>
<i>Everybody knows who they are.</i>

861
01:17:33.791 --> 01:17:36.385
<i>And the law is in</i>
<i>for a piece of the action.</i>

862
01:17:38.191 --> 01:17:40.895
<i>So. you want to play</i>
<i>with knives?</i>

863
01:17:42.393 --> 01:17:47.902
<i>You want to spit on me and make</i>
<i>me crawl. white motherfucker?</i>

864
01:17:47.937 --> 01:17:50.366
<i>Well. you picked</i>
<i>the wrong player.</i>

865
01:17:50.401 --> 01:17:53.105
<i>It seems like I'm in a dream.</i>

866
01:17:53.140 --> 01:17:54.942
<i>And I'm still in this dream.</i>

867
01:17:54.977 --> 01:17:59.782
<i>and it wouldn't take much</i>
<i>for me to kill you now.</i>

868
01:17:59.817 --> 01:18:02.851
<i>Shit. Look.</i>
<i>I ain't gonna shoot you.</i>

869
01:18:02.886 --> 01:18:07.284
<i>I'm gonna piss on your grave</i>
<i>tomorrow.</i>

870
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:18.031
What'd you think?

871
01:18:21.333 --> 01:18:23.036
She wasn't real.

872
01:18:23.071 --> 01:18:25.170
Was she?

873
01:18:27.042 --> 01:18:30.505
What she believed in.
what she stood for was.

874
01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:32.474
Right on.

875
01:18:35.413 --> 01:18:37.820
You said you was going back.

876
01:18:37.855 --> 01:18:39.789
I am.

877
01:18:43.025 --> 01:18:45.421
What's going on. Alice?

878
01:18:45.456 --> 01:18:48.358
I'm going back.
Tomorrow.

879
01:18:48.393 --> 01:18:51.031
You can't go back by yourself.

880
01:18:53.299 --> 01:18:55.871
-The police ain't gonna help --
-Police?

881
01:18:55.906 --> 01:18:57.939
Them folk that's supposed
to help people.

882
01:18:57.974 --> 01:19:00.909
Well. they help
some people sometimes.

883
01:19:00.944 --> 01:19:02.438
You can't help me?

884
01:19:04.915 --> 01:19:08.312
You still do what
your brother tells you.

885
01:19:08.347 --> 01:19:11.920
So you no different
than me.

886
01:19:11.955 --> 01:19:15.055
But you used to stand
for something --

887
01:19:15.090 --> 01:19:17.255
the marches. the sit-ins.

888
01:19:17.290 --> 01:19:19.796
I saw them
in your memory box.

889
01:19:21.030 --> 01:19:23.998
Frank.

890
01:19:24.033 --> 01:19:26.231
What happened to you?

891
01:19:26.266 --> 01:19:29.366
What happened...

892
01:19:29.401 --> 01:19:33.040
was I spent
a decade of my life

893
01:19:33.075 --> 01:19:36.439
trying to help the cause.

894
01:19:36.474 --> 01:19:38.111
and make a change
for the people.

895
01:19:38.146 --> 01:19:40.278
That's what
happened to me.

896
01:19:40.313 --> 01:19:42.247
You know what changed.

897
01:19:42.282 --> 01:19:45.085
My mother died.

898
01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:47.417
and I got older.

899
01:19:47.452 --> 01:19:49.485
and the leaders got killed.

900
01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.223
and everybody
just stopped trying.

901
01:19:51.258 --> 01:19:53.621
That's what happened.

902
01:19:53.656 --> 01:19:57.097
But you can
make a change.

903
01:19:57.132 --> 01:20:01.134
You can make a change now.

904
01:20:01.169 --> 01:20:04.566
Something that's bigger
than yourself.

905
01:20:04.601 --> 01:20:06.304
Like Coffy.

906
01:20:06.339 --> 01:20:08.471
Oh. Alice.

907
01:20:08.506 --> 01:20:10.473
Oh. no. Just --

908
01:20:10.508 --> 01:20:15.181
A Black man trying
to do something for hisself.

909
01:20:15.216 --> 01:20:18.184
Where is that gonna happen
in America?

910
01:20:18.219 --> 01:20:20.219
That's a death certificate.

911
01:20:20.254 --> 01:20:23.288
You understand me?

912
01:20:23.323 --> 01:20:26.324
I'm asking myself
to get killed doing that.

913
01:20:26.359 --> 01:20:28.194
That's what that is.

914
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:31.461
Where is that gonna happen?
You tell me that.

915
01:20:31.496 --> 01:20:33.265
But you can do something.

916
01:20:36.237 --> 01:20:38.237
You ain't got
no birth certificate

917
01:20:38.272 --> 01:20:40.569
or no Social Security. no I.D.

918
01:20:40.604 --> 01:20:42.945
You -- You can do
what you want.

919
01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:45.442
I didn't expect you
to say yes.

920
01:20:45.477 --> 01:20:47.917
but just so you know.

921
01:20:47.952 --> 01:20:50.645
doing the right thing

922
01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:53.153
is never wrong.

923
01:20:56.422 --> 01:20:59.390
I'm wrong because
I can't help you.

924
01:21:01.064 --> 01:21:02.624
No.

925
01:21:02.659 --> 01:21:05.693
You're wrong...

926
01:21:05.728 --> 01:21:08.201
'cause you don't believe.

927
01:21:10.271 --> 01:21:12.040
Not any more.

928
01:21:17.212 --> 01:21:19.080
What's your plan?

929
01:21:28.388 --> 01:21:30.256
We might need these.

930
01:21:37.727 --> 01:21:40.563
You came out
right about here.

931
01:21:40.598 --> 01:21:43.269
That's the service road
right there.

932
01:21:43.304 --> 01:21:46.008
You want
to take the road?

933
01:21:46.043 --> 01:21:48.472
For what we want to do.
we better.

934
01:21:50.443 --> 01:21:53.114
Yeah. then everybody
can see the truth.

935
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:55.512
What's public transit?

936
01:21:55.547 --> 01:21:57.349
It's a bus. Alice.

937
01:21:57.384 --> 01:22:00.352
It pick people up and
take them where they need to go.

938
01:22:02.554 --> 01:22:05.357
-You sure you want to do this?
-I'm sure.

939
01:22:07.295 --> 01:22:08.525
Well. tomorrow night.

940
01:22:08.560 --> 01:22:10.692
if you change your mind
at any time.

941
01:22:10.727 --> 01:22:12.364
they don't
make you weaker.

942
01:22:12.399 --> 01:22:15.631
We can figure out
how to get everybody out.

943
01:22:15.666 --> 01:22:17.435
Like what?

944
01:22:20.506 --> 01:22:24.409
Well. everything
don't work out as planned.

945
01:22:24.444 --> 01:22:29.150
I used to dream of breaking
my mom out of that hospital.

946
01:22:29.185 --> 01:22:31.020
Why didn't you?

947
01:22:31.055 --> 01:22:33.187
I didn't believe I could.

948
01:22:34.652 --> 01:22:35.992
Frank.

949
01:22:37.523 --> 01:22:39.391
I'm not backing out.

950
01:22:55.706 --> 01:22:57.541
Hello.

951
01:22:57.576 --> 01:22:58.509
<i> Alice.</i>

952
01:22:58.544 --> 01:23:00.148
Frank.

953
01:23:01.745 --> 01:23:03.118
Frank.

954
01:23:03.153 --> 01:23:05.120
I can't do it.
I can't.

955
01:23:05.155 --> 01:23:06.748
<i>I just --</i>
<i>I can't do it.</i>

956
01:23:06.783 --> 01:23:08.750
<i>And. Alice. I don't think</i>
<i>you should do it either.</i>

957
01:23:08.785 --> 01:23:10.059
<i>I really don't --</i>

958
01:23:11.128 --> 01:23:12.523
Alice?

959
01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:02.342
You all right?

960
01:24:05.710 --> 01:24:07.743
Nodding's not
an answer. Frank.

961
01:24:07.778 --> 01:24:09.382
You okay?

962
01:24:12.717 --> 01:24:15.124
Frank?

963
01:24:15.159 --> 01:24:17.687
Nodding is an answer.
Danny.

964
01:24:17.722 --> 01:24:19.590
Be cool.

965
01:24:19.625 --> 01:24:23.363
Nah. You be cool.

966
01:24:23.398 --> 01:24:26.168
I've been cool for a long time.

967
01:24:26.203 --> 01:24:27.664
What's this?

968
01:24:27.699 --> 01:24:31.206
What this is. is I'm telling you
to get out my face.

969
01:24:31.241 --> 01:24:34.209
I'm my own man.
I think for myself.

970
01:24:34.244 --> 01:24:37.212
And you know what
a motherfucking nod is.

971
01:24:58.499 --> 01:25:00.631
Hi.

972
01:25:00.666 --> 01:25:03.172
Hello.

973
01:25:17.947 --> 01:25:19.386
Get in.

974
01:25:23.722 --> 01:25:25.590
It's better than the bus.

975
01:25:47.251 --> 01:25:50.285
10-8. there's a wildfire
on the I-55 highway.

976
01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:52.221
<i> Copy that.</i>
<i>What's your 20?</i>

977
01:25:52.256 --> 01:25:55.554
A service road right off
the Hitchcocks exit. 34A.

978
01:25:55.589 --> 01:25:57.424
<i>Fire truck en route.</i>

979
01:26:02.827 --> 01:26:04.695
Thought I knew better.

980
01:26:09.273 --> 01:26:10.833
I'm proud of you.

981
01:26:14.036 --> 01:26:16.938
Your mama...

982
01:26:16.973 --> 01:26:19.281
would be proud of you.

983
01:27:02.821 --> 01:27:04.018
Hurry your asses up!

984
01:27:08.024 --> 01:27:10.431
Hurry your asses up!

985
01:27:12.699 --> 01:27:15.832
All right!
Gather up!

986
01:27:30.816 --> 01:27:32.915
Get everyone
behind the house!

987
01:28:20.998 --> 01:28:23.900
Alice?

988
01:28:23.935 --> 01:28:25.671
Who'd you think
it was gonna be?

989
01:28:30.942 --> 01:28:32.810
You ain't gonna
win this fight.

990
01:28:32.845 --> 01:28:34.944
Get your ass back.

991
01:28:36.915 --> 01:28:39.553
You're not gonna
leave here again.

992
01:28:39.588 --> 01:28:41.687
At least not in one piece.

993
01:28:42.789 --> 01:28:44.888
Get inside.

994
01:28:52.535 --> 01:28:55.602
Sit.

995
01:28:55.637 --> 01:28:57.670
On the bed.

996
01:29:01.445 --> 01:29:02.939
What do you want. Alice?

997
01:29:02.974 --> 01:29:05.106
I want...

998
01:29:05.141 --> 01:29:07.713
everyone to see the truth.

999
01:29:07.748 --> 01:29:09.649
Well. all they're gonna see
is fire.

1000
01:29:09.684 --> 01:29:11.013
and thanks to you.
they're gonna work

1001
01:29:11.048 --> 01:29:13.785
through the night.
putting it out.

1002
01:29:13.820 --> 01:29:15.424
No.

1003
01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:23.025
No. they're not.

1004
01:29:23.060 --> 01:29:26.127
My family's done working
for you.

1005
01:29:26.162 --> 01:29:27.766
It's over.

1006
01:29:29.605 --> 01:29:32.606
Everything you hid from us.

1007
01:29:32.641 --> 01:29:35.576
all the lies you told

1008
01:29:35.611 --> 01:29:40.548
to make yourself
feel important...

1009
01:29:40.583 --> 01:29:45.685
it's all coming down
right before your eyes.

1010
01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:53.693
Some things...

1011
01:29:53.728 --> 01:29:55.827
you can't hide forever.

1012
01:29:58.062 --> 01:30:00.832
I'm smarter than you.

1013
01:30:00.867 --> 01:30:03.934
I'm better than you.

1014
01:30:03.969 --> 01:30:07.102
And I know
that scares you.

1015
01:30:11.009 --> 01:30:14.780
How does it feel?

1016
01:30:14.815 --> 01:30:18.586
I gave you all
a meaningful life!

1017
01:30:18.621 --> 01:30:20.819
Meaningful.

1018
01:30:20.854 --> 01:30:23.591
This tradition was born
long before you.

1019
01:30:25.661 --> 01:30:28.024
Alice. you j--

1020
01:30:28.059 --> 01:30:30.059
You don't make sense.

1021
01:30:32.833 --> 01:30:36.230
I never told anyone
that they had to stay.

1022
01:30:54.250 --> 01:30:58.252
I just never told them
that they could go.

1023
01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:22.144
What are you gonna do?

1024
01:31:22.179 --> 01:31:24.586
Hmm?

1025
01:31:24.621 --> 01:31:27.622
You gonna kill me?

1026
01:31:27.657 --> 01:31:28.953
I'm gonna make sure

1027
01:31:28.988 --> 01:31:33.188
your last few breaths
feel like hell.

1028
01:31:33.223 --> 01:31:34.893
Well. Hell. Alice...

1029
01:31:34.928 --> 01:31:36.730
-Is where you're going!
-...is where you're going!

1030
01:31:36.765 --> 01:31:38.798
<i>Oh. oh</i>

1031
01:31:38.833 --> 01:31:41.735
<i>You better think</i>

1032
01:31:41.770 --> 01:31:44.232
<i>Think</i>

1033
01:31:48.238 --> 01:31:52.009
<i>That's the thing</i>
<i>I never will forget</i>

1034
01:31:52.044 --> 01:31:55.749
<i>Now baby. I got a life to live</i>
<i>and a whole lotta lovin'</i>

1035
01:31:56.818 --> 01:31:58.851
<i>That I want to give you</i>

1036
01:31:58.886 --> 01:32:00.952
<i>Yeah</i>

1037
01:32:00.987 --> 01:32:05.693
<i>But before I give it up.</i>
<i>I got to think. think</i>

1038
01:32:05.728 --> 01:32:09.290
Do you know Alice?

1039
01:32:09.325 --> 01:32:10.929
Yeah. I know Alice.

1040
01:32:14.066 --> 01:32:16.099
<i>I don't need no heartache</i>

1041
01:32:16.134 --> 01:32:18.002
<i>-I can't stand no misery</i>

1042
01:32:18.037 --> 01:32:20.609
<i>Let me think</i>

1043
01:32:20.644 --> 01:32:21.973
<i>Think</i>

1044
01:32:30.049 --> 01:32:32.951
<i>All right</i>

1045
01:32:32.986 --> 01:32:34.183
<i>Hey!</i>

1046
01:32:34.218 --> 01:32:36.086
Alice!

1047
01:32:36.121 --> 01:32:38.693
Ow!

1048
01:32:41.764 --> 01:32:43.258
<i>Don't say it's easy.</i>
<i>know it can be rough</i>

1049
01:32:43.293 --> 01:32:44.930
<i>Don't</i>

1050
01:32:46.769 --> 01:32:49.902
<i>Just plain living.</i>
<i>sometimes it's kinda tough</i>

1051
01:32:49.937 --> 01:32:51.937
Oh. no! No!

1052
01:32:54.040 --> 01:32:57.305
<i>You bad</i>

1053
01:32:57.340 --> 01:33:01.782
<i>You bad. you bad</i>

I'm sorry!

01:33:03.885 --> 01:33:04.983
What are you doing?!

1056
01:33:05.018 --> 01:33:06.886
What are you doing?!

1057
01:33:06.921 --> 01:33:08.250

<i>It take two to make</i>
<i>a thing go right</i>

1065
01:34:12.052 --> 01:34:15.152
I can't believe you made it out.

1066
01:34:15.187 --> 01:34:18.254
I can't believe<i> we</i> made it out.

1067
01:34:23.063 --> 01:34:24.766
<i>All right</i>

1068
01:34:28.068 --> 01:34:30.871

01:35:37.434 --> 01:35:41.876
<i>So I'm laying the cards</i>
<i>on the table</i>

1091
01:35:41.911 --> 01:35:44.109
<i>When it comes</i>
<i>to taking care of me</i>

1092
01:35:44.144 --> 01:35:46.177
<i>I know I'm able</i>

1093
01:35:46.212 --> 01:35:50.313
<i>You may not call it true</i>

1094
01:35:50.348 --> 01:35:54.350
<i>But I won't do nothing</i>
<i>that you won't do</i>

1095
01:35:54.385 --> 01:35:57.826
<i>Said I won't do nothing</i>
<i>that you won't do</i>

1096
01:35:57.861 --> 01:36:00.455
<i>So think</i>

1097
01:36:00.490 --> 01:36:02.325
<i>About the good things</i>

1098
01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:04.162

1099
01:36:43.071 --> 01:36:47.975

1103
01:36:59.483 --> 01:37:02.649
<i>Things are changing now</i>

1104
01:37:02.684 --> 01:37:07.522
<i>I turned the page</i>
<i>and wrote my story</i>

1105
01:37:07.557 --> 01:37:12.527
<i>It begins with faith.</i>
<i>but don't you worry</i>

1106
01:37:12.562 --> 01:37:17.037
<i>I only want</i>

1123
01:38:07.188 --> 01:38:12.125
<i>Got to get lost</i>
<i>to find who you are at times</i>

1124
01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:13.423
