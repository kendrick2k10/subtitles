Hi. Chelsea.

73
00:02:54.348 --> 00:02:56.350
Hello. Dreamhouse.

74
00:02:56.437 --> 00:02:57.699
Hello. Barbie.

75
00:02:57.786 --> 00:02:59.962
Two hot chocolates. please.

76
00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.094
You got it. Barbie!

77
00:03:05.228 --> 00:03:07.796
Whoa. cool!

78
00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:11.060
Yum!

79
00:03:11.147 --> 00:03:12.148
I didn't know it could do that!

80
00:03:12.235 --> 00:03:14.019
With the new Smarthome app.

81
00:03:14.106 --> 00:03:15.804
the Dreamhouse can do
just about anything.

82
00:03:17.893 --> 00:03:20.112
Anything?

83
00:03:24.378 --> 00:03:25.988
Hello. Dreamhouse?

84
00:03:26.075 --> 00:03:27.642
Yes. Chelsea?

85
00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.384
Can you help me plan
an awesome party tomorrow?

86
00:03:30.471 --> 00:03:32.864
Why. of course.
I'd be happy to help.

87
00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:35.302
Wait!

88
00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:40.045
I... um... I mean... party?
Why do we need a party?

89
00:03:40.132 --> 00:03:43.701
Is there something happening
tomorrow?

90
00:03:43.788 --> 00:03:45.921
It's my birthday!

91
00:03:46.617 --> 00:03:48.532
It's my birthday.
it's my birthday.

92
00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:51.666
it's my birthday. yeah!

93
00:03:51.753 --> 00:03:53.668
Really? Are you sure?

94
00:03:53.755 --> 00:03:56.323
I could have sworn
that was next week.

95
00:03:57.237 --> 00:03:58.629
Nuh-uh.

96
00:03:58.716 --> 00:04:00.805
Hello. Dreamhouse.
When is my birthday?

97
00:04:00.892 --> 00:04:02.372
My calendar shows

98
00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.983
that tomorrow is.
in fact. your birthday.

99
00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:06.811
It's my birthday.
it's my birthday.

100
00:04:06.898 --> 00:04:08.944
it's my birthday. yeah!

101
00:04:09.031 --> 00:04:10.772
It's my birth...

102
00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.295
Wait.

103
00:04:12.904 --> 00:04:15.255
You're up to something.
aren't you?

104
00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.828
I... have no idea
what you're talking about.

105
00:04:23.915 --> 00:04:25.830
I am not planning...

106
00:04:25.917 --> 00:04:26.831
I mean. why would I be...

107
00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.835
Oh. thank goodness.
Hello. Dreamhouse.

108
00:04:30.922 --> 00:04:32.968
Show me who's
at the door. please.

109
00:04:35.753 --> 00:04:37.929
Barbie. Teresa. Renee!

110
00:04:38.016 --> 00:04:40.497
Oh! Quick. let's hide!

111
00:04:40.584 --> 00:04:42.847
Why are we hiding. exactly?

112
00:04:42.934 --> 00:04:44.893
You'll see. I've got an idea.

113
00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:50.377
Hmm. That's weird.

114
00:04:50.464 --> 00:04:54.859
Uh. Barbie did tell us
to meet her here. right?

115
00:04:54.946 --> 00:04:57.035
Huh. It's on my calendar.

116
00:04:57.122 --> 00:04:59.690
Huh.

117
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.826
Slumber...

118
00:05:04.913 --> 00:05:06.349
party?

119
00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.832
-  Wow.

120
00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.050
Love it!

121
00:05:12.137 --> 00:05:14.618
-  Cool!
-  Ooh!

122
00:05:14.705 --> 00:05:16.620
A kaleidoscope of butterflies!

123
00:05:16.707 --> 00:05:18.448
That's what you call
a group of butterflies.

124
00:05:18.535 --> 00:05:19.580
a kaleidoscope.

125
00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:22.887
Ah! Beautiful.

126
00:05:22.974 --> 00:05:25.325
How is this possible?

127
00:05:27.109 --> 00:05:28.110
Hello!

128
00:05:28.197 --> 00:05:30.155
- Aah!

129
00:05:35.117 --> 00:05:37.075
Your... your face...

130
00:05:37.162 --> 00:05:39.339
If only you could see yourself.

131
00:05:39.426 --> 00:05:41.863
You were like... Whoa!

132
00:05:44.518 --> 00:05:47.259
You got me
good there. for sure.

133
00:05:47.912 --> 00:05:51.786
Ho-ho. we're gonna
get you for that!

134
00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.269
- Come here!
- Look out!

135
00:05:59.184 --> 00:06:01.970
- Thanks for coming.
- Of course!

136
00:06:03.145 --> 00:06:06.061
So... those butterflies?

137
00:06:06.148 --> 00:06:08.106
Where did they go?

138
00:06:08.193 --> 00:06:10.326
And where did they come from?

139
00:06:11.327 --> 00:06:14.330
It's all part of the magic
of the new Dreamhouse.

140
00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:25.254
Hello. Dreamhouse!
Activate chessboard.

141
00:06:32.957 --> 00:06:34.176
- Come here!

142
00:06:36.221 --> 00:06:38.267
Does Chelsea have any idea...

143
00:06:38.354 --> 00:06:41.270
That you three are really here
to help me plan

144
00:06:41.357 --> 00:06:43.794
the most epic surprise
birthday party ever tomorrow?

145
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:46.275
She has no clue
what we're really up to.

146
00:06:46.362 --> 00:06:49.670
She thinks you're here for
a perfectly normal sleepover.

147
00:06:54.936 --> 00:06:57.939
So... what do you have
planned so far?

148
00:06:58.026 --> 00:07:01.290
I know she wants a carrot cake
with pink and white frosting.

149
00:07:01.377 --> 00:07:04.293
and I've picked out decorations.

150
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:05.990
but there's
something missing.

151
00:07:06.077 --> 00:07:08.297
I just can't put
my finger on it.

152
00:07:08.384 --> 00:07:11.256
We can figure it out together.

153
00:07:14.346 --> 00:07:16.566
Whaa...

154
00:07:16.653 --> 00:07:19.830
When did... she get... so fast?

155
00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:23.921
Hello. Dreamhouse.
Activate slide.

156
00:07:24.008 --> 00:07:28.796
- Oh! And ball pit.

157
00:07:29.361 --> 00:07:33.453
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

158
00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:37.282
Aah!

159
00:07:39.371 --> 00:07:41.286
- Whoa!

160
00:07:43.811 --> 00:07:45.290
Whee!

161
00:07:47.423 --> 00:07:50.948
All right. this new
Smarthome app is pretty cool.

162
00:07:51.035 --> 00:07:52.950
"Pretty cool"?

163
00:07:53.037 --> 00:07:53.951
Hello. Dreamhouse...

164
00:07:54.038 --> 00:07:55.605
Up. please.

165
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.087
What?!

166
00:08:01.002 --> 00:08:03.483
Whoo!

167
00:08:17.061 --> 00:08:18.976
- Time for bed.

168
00:08:23.067 --> 00:08:24.982
Doh moh go behbuh.

169
00:08:25.069 --> 00:08:26.636
Moh moh noh!

170
00:08:26.723 --> 00:08:29.987
Chelsea. finish
brushing your teeth first.

171
00:08:30.074 --> 00:08:30.988
In the bathroom.

172
00:08:31.075 --> 00:08:33.991
Nnh ghh buhroo!

173
00:08:37.212 --> 00:08:39.562
I don't want to go to bed yet.

174
00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:41.956
I'm having too much fun.

175
00:08:44.088 --> 00:08:46.003
See? You're exhausted.

176
00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:49.006
Besides. the sooner
you get to sleep.

177
00:08:49.093 --> 00:08:52.227
the sooner it's your birthday!

178
00:08:54.098 --> 00:08:55.012
All right.

179
00:08:55.099 --> 00:08:56.840
I guess I'm pretty tired.

180
00:09:03.107 --> 00:09:05.719
Can we at least
do a story first?

181
00:09:05.806 --> 00:09:07.503
- That's a great idea.

182
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.157
What kind of story
do you want to hear?

183
00:09:09.244 --> 00:09:11.159
Hmm. I'm not sure.

184
00:09:11.246 --> 00:09:13.117
Why don't we make one up?

185
00:09:13.204 --> 00:09:14.162
Together.

186
00:09:14.249 --> 00:09:15.119
I love that.

187
00:09:15.206 --> 00:09:16.120
Genius!

188
00:09:16.207 --> 00:09:18.427
Yay!

189
00:09:18.514 --> 00:09:20.690
Okay. Chels.
why don't you start?

190
00:09:20.777 --> 00:09:22.518
Okay. Hmm.

191
00:09:22.605 --> 00:09:25.521
Once upon a time.
there were two mermaids.

192
00:09:25.608 --> 00:09:27.828
Why don't we have
the Dreamhouse

193
00:09:27.915 --> 00:09:29.569
bring the story to life?

194
00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:31.179
Hello. Dreamhouse?

195
00:09:31.266 --> 00:09:33.268
Way ahead of you. Barbie.

196
00:09:38.795 --> 00:09:42.146
- Whoa!
- And they each had a pet...

197
00:09:42.233 --> 00:09:44.018
Sea turtle!

198
00:09:44.105 --> 00:09:45.802
No. octopi!

199
00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:50.677
Technically. the plural
of "octopus" is "octopuses".

200
00:09:50.764 --> 00:09:52.940
Really? That sounds funny.

201
00:09:53.027 --> 00:09:54.202
I know. right?

202
00:09:54.289 --> 00:09:56.900
Okay. Pet octopuses.

203
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.513
That's still not right.

204
00:10:02.297 --> 00:10:04.386
- How about dolphins?
- Yeah!

205
00:10:08.738 --> 00:10:11.088
They loved playing
in the waves together.

206
00:10:11.175 --> 00:10:13.221
And exploring
the beautiful coral reefs

207
00:10:13.308 --> 00:10:16.311
and discovering
new undersea flora and fauna.

208
00:10:20.837 --> 00:10:24.188
Ooh! And they loved...

209
00:10:24.275 --> 00:10:26.190
dance parties!

210
00:10:28.323 --> 00:10:30.238
Yeah! Ballet dance parties.

211
00:10:30.325 --> 00:10:33.241
I love... I mean.
the mermaids love ballet

212
00:10:33.328 --> 00:10:35.243
because it's so graceful

213
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:38.246
and it takes so much practice
to get right.

214
00:10:38.333 --> 00:10:41.249
One day. they were
so busy dancing

215
00:10:41.336 --> 00:10:43.251
that they didn't see

216
00:10:43.338 --> 00:10:46.167
the Sea Dragon
was right behind them!

217
00:10:52.216 --> 00:10:53.261
The Sea Dragon!

218
00:10:53.348 --> 00:10:55.219
Who wore a pearl necklace.

219
00:10:59.006 --> 00:11:01.269
She said sorry
for scaring the mermaids.

220
00:11:01.356 --> 00:11:02.357
She was just lonely.

221
00:11:02.444 --> 00:11:04.272
and she invited the mermaids

222
00:11:04.359 --> 00:11:05.795
over for a tea party.

223
00:11:05.882 --> 00:11:07.275
The mermaids
sipped underwater tea

224
00:11:07.362 --> 00:11:08.406
with the Sea Dragon...

225
00:11:10.104 --> 00:11:13.063
...and they all became
the best of friends.

226
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:15.239
The end.

227
00:11:17.372 --> 00:11:19.417
Best... story... ever.

228
00:11:19.504 --> 00:11:21.245
So imaginative.

229
00:11:21.332 --> 00:11:22.246
So fun.

230
00:11:22.333 --> 00:11:23.247
Magical.

231
00:11:23.334 --> 00:11:24.248
Thank you!

232
00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:25.685
Mm!

233
00:11:27.338 --> 00:11:28.252
Mm...

234
00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:29.253
Time for bed.

235
00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.386
Okay.

236
00:11:36.217 --> 00:11:37.392
Good night. Chelsea.

237
00:11:37.479 --> 00:11:38.915
Good night. everyone.

238
00:11:51.406 --> 00:11:53.625
She's asleep. Finally.

239
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:56.846
So. how can we help with
the surprise party tomorrow?

240
00:11:56.933 --> 00:11:58.326
I want to throw Chelsea

241
00:11:58.413 --> 00:12:01.329
the biggest and best
birthday ever.

242
00:12:01.416 --> 00:12:04.332
A birthday so special that...

243
00:12:04.419 --> 00:12:06.856
that we can't even
call it a birthday.

244
00:12:06.943 --> 00:12:08.162
What should we call it. then?

245
00:12:08.249 --> 00:12:10.338
A Dreamday.

246
00:12:10.425 --> 00:12:13.036
We should call it a Dreamday!

247
00:12:13.123 --> 00:12:14.690
I like it.

248
00:12:14.777 --> 00:12:16.344
So. what have you
figured out so far?

249
00:12:16.431 --> 00:12:19.347
I've made a list
of everything we need to do.

250
00:12:19.434 --> 00:12:21.784
but... there's still
something missing.

251
00:12:21.871 --> 00:12:24.265
Something to bring it
all together.

252
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.137
We need a theme!

253
00:12:27.224 --> 00:12:29.357
All good birthdays.
or Dreamdays.

254
00:12:29.444 --> 00:12:30.314
have a theme. right?

255
00:12:30.401 --> 00:12:31.489
That's it!

256
00:12:31.576 --> 00:12:33.491
Let's brainstorm party themes.

257
00:12:33.578 --> 00:12:35.363
Do you have any ideas?

258
00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:36.799
Excuse me. Barbie.

259
00:12:36.886 --> 00:12:39.019
I have a reminder set.
Time for bed.

260
00:12:39.106 --> 00:12:40.150
Oh. right.

261
00:12:40.237 --> 00:12:41.630
You heard her story.

262
00:12:41.717 --> 00:12:43.632
She loves ballet dance parties.

263
00:12:43.719 --> 00:12:46.374
How about a ballet-themed party?

264
00:12:46.461 --> 00:12:48.332
Hello. Dreamhouse.

265
00:12:48.419 --> 00:12:50.378

Chelsea. like me. is also
very curious and imaginative.

288
00:13:51.526 --> 00:13:53.136
Remember the Sea Dragon?

289
00:13:53.223 --> 00:13:55.443
What if we had some
intellectual conversation

290
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:56.879
over a fancy tea party?

291
00:13:56.966 --> 00:13:58.576
Uh. hello?

292
00:13:58.663 --> 00:14:00.448
We're forgetting that
the whole story took place

293
00:14:00.535 --> 00:14:02.450
in the water and waves.

294
00:14:02.537 --> 00:14:04.452
We should transform the pool

295
00:14:04.539 --> 00:14:07.150
into a beach paradise party.

296
00:14:07.237 --> 00:14:08.978
I love these ideas!

297
00:14:09.065 --> 00:14:10.458
And we can't forget
the pet dolphins.

298
00:14:10.545 --> 00:14:12.852

So... which theme
do you think we should do?

332
00:15:51.341 --> 00:15:55.258
Hmm... I love them all so much.

333
00:15:55.345 --> 00:15:57.260
Aw...

334
00:15:57.347 --> 00:15:59.697
Let's do all of them!

335
00:16:08.271 --> 00:16:10.273
Mm...

336
00:16:11.361 --> 00:16:12.972
I'll see you later for...

337
00:16:13.059 --> 00:16:15.452
Don't want to keep
Mr. and Mrs. Roberts waiting.

338
00:16:15.539 --> 00:16:18.020
Have a great soccer practice!

339
00:16:18.107 --> 00:16:19.282
Okay. I just...

340
00:16:19.369 --> 00:16:21.241
Bye. love you!

341
00:16:21.328 --> 00:16:22.285
- But--
- Bye! See you later!

342
00:16:22.372 --> 00:16:23.286
Have fun! Bye!

343
00:16:23.373 --> 00:16:24.853
- Goodb--

344
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:28.074
Okay. No time to waste.
Let's get started.

345
00:16:28.161 --> 00:16:29.292
Brooklyn. you take
the living room.

346
00:16:29.379 --> 00:16:30.815
On it!

347
00:16:30.902 --> 00:16:32.295
Teresa gets the dining room.
and Renee...

348
00:16:32.382 --> 00:16:35.298
I'll be out by the pool
making the magic happen.

349
00:16:35.385 --> 00:16:39.346
You are magic. Thank you.

350
00:16:39.433 --> 00:16:41.609
Hello. Dreamhouse.
Let's get started. shall we?

351
00:16:41.696 --> 00:16:44.351
Hello. Barbie.
How can I assist you?

352
00:16:44.438 --> 00:16:47.876
We need to transform this room
into a ballet studio.

353
00:16:49.965 --> 00:16:52.228
Wow. Yes!

354
00:16:53.447 --> 00:16:56.145
But we need mirrors.
Could you make the windows--

355
00:16:56.232 --> 00:16:57.494
Ah! Love it!

356
00:17:00.062 --> 00:17:02.108
Thank you. Barbie.

357
00:17:02.195 --> 00:17:03.413
Now. I need to change.

358
00:17:05.111 --> 00:17:06.329
Perfect.

359
00:17:11.856 --> 00:17:14.424
Hello. Dreamhouse?
We'll need a tea set.

360
00:17:14.511 --> 00:17:16.513
Of course. Barbie.

361
00:17:17.427 --> 00:17:18.907
Ooh. yes.

362
00:17:18.994 --> 00:17:21.388
And on the tables.
can we get a delectable display

363
00:17:21.475 --> 00:17:24.434
of veggie tea sandwiches.
cupcakes. and fruit tarts?

364
00:17:24.521 --> 00:17:26.523
Absolutely.

365
00:17:29.309 --> 00:17:30.788
That is lovely!

366
00:17:33.661 --> 00:17:35.184
Hello. Dreamhouse.

367
00:17:35.271 --> 00:17:37.839
Can you please add
some floaties to the pool?

368
00:17:38.709 --> 00:17:42.365
Perfect. Okay. now.
can we add a couple cabanas

369
00:17:42.452 --> 00:17:45.194
there and there.

370
00:17:45.281 --> 00:17:46.848
and some lounge chairs?

371
00:17:49.329 --> 00:17:50.895
Awesome!

372
00:17:50.982 --> 00:17:53.724
Oh! And how about
a volleyball net over here?

373
00:17:55.422 --> 00:17:57.163
Oh! Thank you. Dreamhouse!

374
00:17:57.250 --> 00:17:59.208
This is so fun.

375
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:01.384
Mm.

376
00:18:01.471 --> 00:18:02.907
Hello. Dreamhouse.

377
00:18:02.994 --> 00:18:05.214
Could I have a bunch
of puppies. please?

378
00:18:05.301 --> 00:18:06.389
Of course. Barbie.

379
00:18:08.696 --> 00:18:11.046
Aww!

380
00:18:12.482 --> 00:18:14.919
And some kittens too. please?

381
00:18:21.491 --> 00:18:23.406
Aw. thanks. Dreamhouse.

382
00:18:23.493 --> 00:18:24.407
No problem!

383
00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.893
Hmm...

384
00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.418
it just doesn't feel
Dreamday special enough.

385
00:18:35.505 --> 00:18:36.506
Hello. Dreamhouse?

386
00:18:37.507 --> 00:18:38.552
Dreamhouse?

387
00:18:38.639 --> 00:18:40.249
How may I assist you. Barbie?

388
00:18:40.336 --> 00:18:41.424
Could we add bunnies?

389
00:18:41.511 --> 00:18:43.339
If you dream it...

390
00:18:43.426 --> 00:18:45.994
Oh. wait a second.

391
00:18:46.081 --> 00:18:47.865
Uh... Barbie?

392
00:18:47.952 --> 00:18:51.130
Could you make the animals
fun different colors. please?

393
00:18:54.568 --> 00:18:56.483
Aw! Perfect.

394
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:58.267
Will you please
excuse me? Renee is calling.

395
00:18:58.354 --> 00:18:59.529
Thank you. Dreamhouse.

396
00:18:59.616 --> 00:19:01.444
Now. let's see
how everyone else

397
00:19:01.531 --> 00:19:02.532
is doing with their parties.

398
00:19:03.533 --> 00:19:04.447
Wow.

399
00:19:04.534 --> 00:19:06.971
It's perfect. isn't it?

400
00:19:07.537 --> 00:19:11.454
Yeah. But maybe...

401
00:19:11.541 --> 00:19:13.326
How about a disco ball
and a light show?

402
00:19:13.413 --> 00:19:14.718
Um...

403
00:19:14.805 --> 00:19:17.156
Hello. Dreamhouse.
Would you mind?

404
00:19:20.898 --> 00:19:24.380
Keep going. Make it magical.

405
00:19:27.427 --> 00:19:29.472
-  How's it going?
- Great!

406
00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:30.821
I'm brainstorming
all the cool things

407
00:19:30.908 --> 00:19:32.475
we can talk about with Chelsea.

408
00:19:32.562 --> 00:19:34.085
Should we contemplate
the vastness

409
00:19:34.173 --> 00:19:36.479
of the stars. space.
and the universe first.

410
00:19:36.566 --> 00:19:39.961
or the wondrous world of mold?

411
00:19:41.049 --> 00:19:42.311
Hmm...

412
00:19:42.398 --> 00:19:43.660
Huh. what am I thinking?

413
00:19:43.747 --> 00:19:45.967
<i>Por supuesto.</i> it should be...

414
00:19:46.054 --> 00:19:47.490
Hello. Dreamhouse?

415
00:19:47.577 --> 00:19:49.492
What are the differences
and similarities

416
00:19:49.579 --> 00:19:51.494
between llamas and alpacas?

417
00:19:51.581 --> 00:19:54.497
Uh. the average alpaca
weighs 150 pounds.

418
00:19:54.584 --> 00:19:57.500
whereas a llama can weigh
up to 400 pounds.

419
00:19:57.587 --> 00:19:59.546
although both llamas
and alpacas

420
00:19:59.633 --> 00:20:01.504
have a similar alarm call
when they sense danger.

421
00:20:01.591 --> 00:20:03.724
It sounds like this.

422
00:20:10.731 --> 00:20:14.517
Okay. thank you.
That was... informative.

423
00:20:14.604 --> 00:20:17.085
Oh. hey. Barbie.
what do you think?

424
00:20:17.172 --> 00:20:18.782
About llamas?

425
00:20:18.869 --> 00:20:20.610
The tea party!

426
00:20:20.697 --> 00:20:23.134
Oh! It's fantastic.

427
00:20:23.222 --> 00:20:26.921
But... we need a centerpiece.
Hello. Dreamhouse?

428
00:20:27.008 --> 00:20:30.229
Can we get a giant cake
right here. please?

429
00:20:31.186 --> 00:20:32.318
Bigger!

430
00:20:33.275 --> 00:20:36.278
Bigger!

431
00:20:36.365 --> 00:20:38.237
That's perfect!

432
00:20:40.239 --> 00:20:42.893
Isn't this incredible?

433
00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.939
Yes. it is.

434
00:20:45.026 --> 00:20:46.941
but it can be
even more incredible.

435
00:20:47.028 --> 00:20:49.944
Hello. Dreamhouse...
add palm trees!

436
00:20:50.031 --> 00:20:51.772
You got it. Barbie.

437
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:54.078
Awesome!

438
00:20:54.165 --> 00:20:56.429
And a waterslide!

439
00:20:56.516 --> 00:20:59.388
Oh! [glitches] Yes. yes. Barbie.

440
00:20:59.475 --> 00:21:01.869
It's... my pleasure.

441
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:07.135
That... is... so... epic!

442
00:21:10.834 --> 00:21:13.576
Malibu. I think you should
stop for just a second.

443
00:21:13.663 --> 00:21:15.535
No time. Can't stop.
Chelsea will be back soon!

444
00:21:15.622 --> 00:21:17.537
We need to dream bigger.

445
00:21:17.624 --> 00:21:18.538
Hello. Dreamhouse!

446
00:21:18.625 --> 00:21:19.582
Add giraffes and zebras

447
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:22.542
and... [gasping] ...lions!

448
00:21:22.629 --> 00:21:23.717
Lions?!

449
00:21:23.804 --> 00:21:25.762
Right. Bad idea.
Scrap the lions.

450
00:21:25.849 --> 00:21:28.983
Dreamhouse. how about
we scrap all large animals...

451
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:30.550
for safety.

452
00:21:31.594 --> 00:21:33.596
Okay. Dreamhouse.
let's get to work.

453
00:21:33.683 --> 00:21:36.164

A little t-trouble.

522
00:24:02.397 --> 00:24:06.749
I-I... am... detecting an error.

523
00:24:10.318 --> 00:24:12.929
Is that
chlorinated pool water?

524
00:24:13.016 --> 00:24:15.192
What happened to my
Rosehip Peach Delight?

525
00:24:15.279 --> 00:24:16.324
Aah!

526
00:24:20.241 --> 00:24:24.027
Uh. Teresa. I think we found
your Rosehip Peach Delight.

527
00:24:26.073 --> 00:24:27.074
Oh. no.

528
00:24:42.524 --> 00:24:44.352
Oh...

529
00:25:20.388 --> 00:25:21.258
He-hello. Bar-bie...

530
00:25:21.345 --> 00:25:24.261
bie-bie-bie-bie... Hello.

531
00:25:24.348 --> 00:25:25.349
Wow.

532
00:25:25.436 --> 00:25:28.265
I am so sorry. Dreamhouse.

533
00:25:28.352 --> 00:25:29.266
I got carried away.

534
00:25:29.353 --> 00:25:31.312
You tried to warn me.

535
00:25:31.399 --> 00:25:34.445
Hey. I got caught up
in it all too.

536
00:25:34.533 --> 00:25:35.882
Oh. I should have realized

537
00:25:35.969 --> 00:25:37.318
we were overworking
the programming.

538
00:25:37.405 --> 00:25:39.276
Hello. Barbie.

539
00:25:43.411 --> 00:25:47.197
Man. we totally crashed
the poor Dreamhouse app.

540
00:25:47.284 --> 00:25:49.330
Now everything is ruined.

541
00:25:49.417 --> 00:25:51.288
and Chelsea could be back
any minute!

542
00:25:51.375 --> 00:25:52.289
Let's not panic.

543
00:25:52.376 --> 00:25:53.290
It's not too bad.

544
00:26:05.389 --> 00:26:09.480
Okay. it's pretty bad.
but we got this!

545
00:26:09.568 --> 00:26:11.308
Like my Granny Vi always said.

546
00:26:11.395 --> 00:26:14.094
remember to K.I.S.S.

547
00:26:14.181 --> 00:26:15.574
"Keep It Simple. Silly."

548
00:26:15.661 --> 00:26:18.315
But I wanted things
to be perfect...

549
00:26:19.403 --> 00:26:21.362
...not simple.

550
00:26:21.449 --> 00:26:23.320
and certainly not... this.

551
00:26:31.764 --> 00:26:35.245
You wanted things
to be special. not perfect.

552
00:26:35.332 --> 00:26:37.378
Simple can be special.

553
00:26:37.465 --> 00:26:39.206
Our hearts
were in the right place.

554
00:26:39.293 --> 00:26:42.383
but trying to make four
massive individual parties...

555
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.385
Was way too complicated.
You're right.

556
00:26:44.472 --> 00:26:47.344
I lost sight
of who this was all for...

557
00:26:47.431 --> 00:26:48.824
Chelsea.

558
00:26:48.911 --> 00:26:52.175
We just need to make
one unforgettable party.

559
00:26:52.262 --> 00:26:53.350
Exactly.

560
00:26:53.437 --> 00:26:54.743
And we can still make

561
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.353
an unforgettable Dreamday

562
00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.485
together!

563
00:26:57.572 --> 00:26:59.400
But instead of separate parties.

564
00:26:59.487 --> 00:27:03.360
we'll have one beach. ballet.
tea party Dreamday!

565
00:27:03.447 --> 00:27:05.362
With animal friends!

566
00:27:05.449 --> 00:27:08.017
Right. We can do this.

567
00:27:08.104 --> 00:27:09.366
If we work together.

568
00:27:09.453 --> 00:27:11.412
We got this!

569
00:27:11.499 --> 00:27:14.807
I'll help the Dreamhouse
while you clean.

He-hello. Ba-Barbie...

620
00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:27.635
bie-bie-bie-bie-bie.

621
00:29:36.644 --> 00:29:37.688
Hello. Barbie.

622
00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:39.560
I feel much better.

623
00:29:39.647 --> 00:29:41.518
I needed some time to recharge.

624
00:29:42.693 --> 00:29:44.521
I am so sorry. Dreamhouse.

625
00:29:44.608 --> 00:29:45.522
I got carried away.

626
00:29:45.609 --> 00:29:48.525
We were so not cool.

627
00:29:48.612 --> 00:29:50.223
I'm sorry too.

628
00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:51.572
I should have known better.

629
00:29:51.659 --> 00:29:53.530
We're all sorry. Dreamhouse.

630
00:29:53.617 --> 00:29:55.141
We had too many ideas

631
00:29:55.228 --> 00:29:57.534
that we tried to make happen
all together.

632
00:29:57.621 --> 00:29:58.709
all at once.

633
00:29:59.798 --> 00:30:01.495
Thank you.

634
00:30:01.582 --> 00:30:03.279
Apologies accepted.

635
00:30:03.366 --> 00:30:06.065
Do you think maybe
you have the energy

636
00:30:06.152 --> 00:30:07.762
to help plan a new party?

637
00:30:07.849 --> 00:30:10.896
But this time. we all
work together as a team...

638
00:30:10.983 --> 00:30:12.898
with you.

639
00:30:12.985 --> 00:30:14.813
I'll certainly try. Barbie.

640
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:17.598
Okay. but you have
to promise me one thing.

641
00:30:17.685 --> 00:30:19.774
- Yes?
- Let us know

642
00:30:19.861 --> 00:30:21.732
if you're
getting too overwhelmed.

643
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.604
And we'll make sure to consider

644
00:30:23.691 --> 00:30:26.563
how much we're asking you
to do this time.

645
00:30:26.650 --> 00:30:28.609
Oh. thank you. Barbie.

646
00:30:28.696 --> 00:30:30.741
I'll be sure to speak up
if I need help.

647
00:30:30.829 --> 00:30:33.614
Let's get to work!
Chelsea should be here soon.

648
00:30:33.701 --> 00:30:35.572
Okay. I think we should...

649
00:30:48.672 --> 00:30:52.415
Hello? Hello?

650
00:30:52.502 --> 00:30:53.721
Is anyone home?

651
00:30:57.681 --> 00:30:58.944
Barbie?

652
00:30:59.031 --> 00:31:00.597
Where's everyone else?

653
00:31:00.684 --> 00:31:01.598
I thought...

654
00:31:01.685 --> 00:31:02.773
I'm so sorry. Chelsea.

655
00:31:02.861 --> 00:31:04.166
I... uh...

656
00:31:04.253 --> 00:31:06.603
kinda bungled
your birthday party.

657
00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:08.649
Oh.

658
00:31:08.736 --> 00:31:10.607
Let's go sit down.
and I'll explain.

659
00:31:23.403 --> 00:31:26.623
Surprise!

660
00:31:32.716 --> 00:31:33.630
Oh. wow.

661
00:31:33.717 --> 00:31:35.981
It's amazing!

662
00:31:46.208 --> 00:31:48.645
No! It's better than amazing.

663
00:31:48.732 --> 00:31:51.431
It's... splendorificious!

664
00:31:51.518 --> 00:31:53.737
Happy Dreamday. Chelsea.

665
00:31:53.824 --> 00:31:56.218
Happy Dreamday!

666
00:32:00.788 --> 00:32:03.965
Dreamday? What's a Dreamday?

667
00:32:05.749 --> 00:32:07.708
It means Barbie wanted

668
00:32:07.795 --> 00:32:09.710
to throw you
such a perfect birthday.

669
00:32:09.797 --> 00:32:12.713
she almost broke the Dreamhouse
creating it.

670
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.455
That's how much she loves you.

671
00:32:15.542 --> 00:32:17.544
It's like a birthday...

672
00:32:17.631 --> 00:32:19.981
But even more special.

673
00:32:20.068 --> 00:32:22.679
Ee! Thank you all so much!

674
00:32:22.766 --> 00:32:23.854
I love it.

675
00:32:23.942 --> 00:32:25.900
That includes you. Dreamhouse.

676
00:32:25.987 --> 00:32:29.817
Aw. It truly is
my pleasure. Chelsea.

677
00:32:33.125 --> 00:32:35.518
Mm!

678
00:33:06.506 --> 00:33:08.856
Whoa!

679
00:33:12.338 --> 00:33:13.513
Look at her moves!

680
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.949
Go. Chels! Go. Chels!

681
00:33:15.036 --> 00:33:16.733
I love it!

682
00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:17.865
I got you.

683
00:33:23.784 --> 00:33:26.439
So. you see.
there are projectors

684
00:33:26.526 --> 00:33:27.440
all around the Dreamhouse.

685
00:33:27.527 --> 00:33:28.658
Using light

686
00:33:28.745 --> 00:33:30.573
and electromagnetic imagery.

687
00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:32.140
The Connected Dreamhouse

688
00:33:32.227 --> 00:33:33.794
can create the illusion
of solid objects.

689
00:33:38.973 --> 00:33:40.888
Mm!

690
00:33:42.629 --> 00:33:44.544
So cool!

691
00:33:53.379 --> 00:33:54.554
I got it!

692
00:33:54.641 --> 00:33:55.859
Whoa!

693
00:33:58.340 --> 00:33:59.602
I don't got it.

694
00:34:00.342 --> 00:34:01.604
Oh...

695
00:34:01.691 --> 00:34:03.432
I'm impressed.

696
00:34:03.519 --> 00:34:04.607
You really almost had that.

697
00:34:04.694 --> 00:34:06.914
Even in ballet slippers.

698
00:34:08.655 --> 00:34:10.613
Oh. oops!

699
00:34:10.700 --> 00:34:12.702
Can we go again
after I change shoes?

700
00:34:21.711 --> 00:34:25.759
Okay. okay. enough!

701
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:29.589
I guess there is such a thing
as too many doggie kisses.

702
00:34:31.547 --> 00:34:32.853
Never!

703
00:34:55.528 --> 00:34:57.660
Ahh! Thank you.

704
00:34:57.747 --> 00:34:59.401
This is all so amazing.

705
00:34:59.488 --> 00:35:02.665
You know. all I really need
for a special Dreamday

706
00:35:02.752 --> 00:35:04.189
is to spend it with all of you.

707
00:35:05.059 --> 00:35:06.713
You know what?

708
00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:10.673
I was so worried about
making everything perfect...

709
00:35:10.760 --> 00:35:13.415
but today
wasn't perfect at all.

710
00:35:13.502 --> 00:35:15.678
You ate
way too many sandwiches.

711
00:35:15.765 --> 00:35:17.202
fell on the floor.

712
00:35:17.289 --> 00:35:19.682
and were covered in drool.

713
00:35:19.769 --> 00:35:21.684
And I loved all of it.

714
00:35:21.771 --> 00:35:23.686
so I guess that means

715
00:35:23.773 --> 00:35:25.688
it's not about
getting things perfect.

716
00:35:25.775 --> 00:35:27.864
It's about how things
make you feel.

717
00:35:27.951 --> 00:35:30.650
The imperfections
make it memorable.

718
00:35:30.737 --> 00:35:32.086
Make it special.

719
00:35:35.263 --> 00:35:36.786
Present time!

720
00:35:52.802 --> 00:35:54.891
Ooh. They're so pretty.

721
00:35:54.978 --> 00:35:57.807
Thank you! I love butterflies.

722
00:35:57.894 --> 00:35:59.853
Ooh. one more thing.

723
00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:01.724
Hello. Dreamhouse.

724
00:36:01.811 --> 00:36:03.030
Activate wings!

725
00:36:06.816 --> 00:36:08.862
These wings actually work.

726
00:36:10.777 --> 00:36:11.691
I...

727
00:36:11.778 --> 00:36:13.040
I can fly?!

728
00:36:13.127 --> 00:36:14.737
Only inside the Dreamhouse.

729
00:36:14.824 --> 00:36:16.043
They won't work outside.

730
00:36:21.788 --> 00:36:23.572
Wow! Whee!

731
00:36:23.659 --> 00:36:24.834
Yeah!

732
00:36:29.361 --> 00:36:32.059
I love them. Thank you so much.

733
00:36:32.146 --> 00:36:33.756
Hello. Dreamhouse.

734
00:36:33.843 --> 00:36:35.149
Dim the lights. please.

735
00:36:35.236 --> 00:36:37.020
Of course. Barbie.

736
00:36:47.857 --> 00:36:49.729
How am I going
to blow out those candles?

737
00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:52.819
Use your wings. silly.

738
00:36:52.906 --> 00:36:54.864
Oh. right.

739
00:36:57.954 --> 00:37:00.740
Hey! We need to sing first!

740
00:37:02.176 --> 00:37:03.873
Yeah!

741
00:37:06.702 --> 00:37:07.790
I know the birthday song.

742
00:37:07.877 --> 00:37:10.750

00:37:10.837 --> 00:37:12.621
