James Meredith: I HAD
ENGAGED IN A WAR

12
00:00:31.335 --> 00:00:34.860

OF U.S. TROOPS

18
00:00:50.702 --> 00:00:52.791
Reporter: THE
SITUATION IS BAD.

19
00:00:52.835 --> 00:00:56.317
THE MARSHALS ARE STILL
FIRING TEARGAS SHELLS

20
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.536
AND EXPLODING ALL
OVER THE PLACE.

21
00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.757
Schieffer: I STARTED HEARINGTHUDS AGAINST

22
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.411
THE SIDE OF THE TRUCK

23
00:01:03.454 --> 00:01:04.716

OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

29
00:01:19.818 --> 00:01:21.951

James Meredith: IT HAD ALWAYS
BEEN MY BELIEF THAT MY JOB

31
00:01:26.173 --> 00:01:29.045
WAS TO RESTRUCTURE THE WORLD.

32
00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:33.441
BECAUSE I DIDN'T LIKE NOTHING.
INCLUDING MOST OF THE TIME.

33
00:01:33.484 --> 00:01:35.921
I DIDN'T LIKE JAMES MEREDITH.

34

Judy Meredith: WHAT I
THOUGHT ABOUT WAS

35
00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.232
"WHAT A BRAVE MAN. OR
EITHER HE'S CRAZY AS HECK".

36
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.412

ICON WHO REJECTS THE TERM.

AN INSULT TO CITIZENSHIP.

38
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.378
EVERY CITIZEN IN
THE UNITED STATES

39
00:01:57.421 --> 00:02:01.251
IS ENTITLED TO EVERY
ONE OF THOSE RIGHTS.

40

Narrator: THROUGHOUT IT ALL.

41
00:02:02.818 --> 00:02:04.559
HE MARCHES TO THE
BEAT OF HIS OWN DRUM.

42
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:08.040
SOMETIMES CONTROVERSIAL.

43

45
00:02:17.224 --> 00:02:21.445

Narrator: THIS IS THE
STORY OF JAMES MEREDITH.

47
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:30.889
AN AMERICAN ORIGINAL.

48
00:02:42.553 --> 00:02:43.902
Williams: THE WORD THAT

49
00:02:43.946 --> 00:02:46.340
IMMEDIATELY COMES TO
MIND IS REBEL.

50
00:02:46.383 --> 00:02:48.472
Judy Meredith: IT TOOK ME ABOUT
20 YEARS TO UNDERSTAND

51
00:02:48.516 --> 00:02:52.389
WHAT THE HECK JAMES WAS
TALKING ABOUT MOST TIMES.

52
00:02:52.433 --> 00:02:53.869
Doyle: HE MAKES YOU THINK.

53
00:02:53.912 --> 00:02:56.915
HE MAKES YOU SCRAMBLE
YOUR ASSUMPTIONS

54
00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.352
WHEN IT COMES TO
AMERICAN HISTORY

55
00:02:58.395 --> 00:03:00.310
AND WHEN IT COMES TO RACE.

56
00:03:00.354 --> 00:03:03.008
Narrator: HE WAS BORN
IN KOSCIUSKO. MISSISSIPPI.

57
00:03:04.662 --> 00:03:08.057
THE FAMILY FARM IS PIVOTAL
IN SHAPING HIS OUTLOOK.

58
00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.842
James Meredith: MY FATHER WAS
GOING TO SELL THE FARM

59
00:03:10.886 --> 00:03:14.281
AND HE WANTED TO GIVE ME
FIRST CHANCE TO BUY IT.

60
00:03:14.324 --> 00:03:17.066
THERE WAS REALLY
NOTHING TO CONSIDER.

61
00:03:19.242 --> 00:03:21.505
UNLIKE WHICH IS
GENERALLY THOUGHT.

62
00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.247
I WAS BORN IN PRIVILEGE.

63
00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:27.511
MY FAMILY OWNED LOTS OF LAND.

64
00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:32.560
I WAS BORN IN 1933 IN THE HEART
OF THE AMERICAN DEPRESSION.

65
00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:38.130
BUT WE DIDN'T LIVE
LIKE POOR PEOPLE.

66
00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:39.915
Hazel Meredith: BECAUSE OF
THE WAY WE GREW UP.

67
00:03:39.958 --> 00:03:42.047
WE DIDN'T GROW UP
THINKING WE WERE INFERIOR

68
00:03:42.091 --> 00:03:43.440
TO ANYBODY OR ANYTHING.

69
00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.793
Narrator: ACROSS THE SOUTH.

70
00:03:48.837 --> 00:03:52.797
WHITE SUPREMACY KEPT MOST
BLACKS DISENFRANCHISED.

71
00:03:54.582 --> 00:03:57.019
NOWHERE IS SEGREGATION
MORE BRUTALLY

72
00:03:57.062 --> 00:03:59.282
ENFORCED THAN IN MISSISSIPPI.

73
00:04:00.196 --> 00:04:02.154
James Meredith: YOU SEE. THE
OTHER THING THAT WAS SIGNIFICANT

74
00:04:02.198 --> 00:04:05.767
ABOUT MY GROWING UP
WAS THE ISOLATION.

75
00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.465
I SPENT MOST OF MY
TIME JUST ROAMING

76
00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:13.514
MY FATHER'S 84-ACRE
FARM. TOTALLY BY MYSELF.

77
00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.299
AS A MATTER OF FACT.
I WAS 15 YEARS OLD

78
00:04:16.343 --> 00:04:18.780
BEFORE I KNEW THAT
BLACK WAS SUPPOSED

79
00:04:18.823 --> 00:04:21.391
TO BE AT THE BOTTOM
END OF THE DEAL.

80
00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:25.787
WE VISITED OUR
RELATIVES IN DETROIT.

81
00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.269
AND WE CAME BACK ON THE TRAIN.

82
00:04:29.312 --> 00:04:32.881
AND WHEN WE GOT TO
MEMPHIS. TENNESSEE.

83
00:04:32.924 --> 00:04:34.926
THE CONDUCTOR TOLD
ME AND MY BROTHER

84
00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.277
WE HAD TO MOVE TO THE BLACK CAR.

85
00:04:38.321 --> 00:04:40.192
AND I HAD TO STAND ALL THE WAY

86
00:04:40.236 --> 00:04:44.196
FROM MEMPHIS TO
DURANT. MISSISSIPPI

87
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.374
AND I CRIED ALL THE WAY.

88
00:04:47.417 --> 00:04:50.594
AND I PROMISED GOD
THAT I WAS GONNA SPEND

89
00:04:50.638 --> 00:04:54.468
THE REST OF MY LIFE
TRYING TO CHANGE THAT.

90
00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:56.818
Doyle: HE HAD BEEN
RAISED BY A FATHER

91
00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:59.386
WHO WAS LIKE A
BIBLICAL CHARACTER

92
00:04:59.429 --> 00:05:01.736
OF STRENGTH AND BRILLIANCE

93
00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:04.304
AND THAT FATHER SAID
TO JAMES MEREDITH.

94
00:05:04.347 --> 00:05:09.004
"YOU ARE THE CHOSEN ONE. YOU
ARE GONNA CHANGE HISTORY".

95
00:05:14.966 --> 00:05:17.317
Narrator: IN 1950.
MEREDITH ENLISTS

96

97
00:05:20.537 --> 00:05:23.366
AS JAMES SERVES. THE
FIGHT FOR BLACK EQUALITY

98
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:27.631
IS HEATING UP AND EDUCATION
IS THE PRIMARY BATTLEGROUND.

99
00:05:28.589 --> 00:05:32.593
IN 1957. NINE BLACK
STUDENTS ATTEMPTED TO ENROLL

100
00:05:32.636 --> 00:05:35.683
IN THE CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL
IN LITTLE ROCK. ARKANSAS.

101
00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:40.775
PRESIDENT EISENHOWER. UNDER
PRESSURE FROM THE NAACP.

102
00:05:40.818 --> 00:05:43.299
MOBILIZES FEDERAL
TROOPS TO ENFORCE

103
00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.214
THEIR RIGHT TO
ATTEND THE SCHOOL.

104
00:05:46.998 --> 00:05:49.218
JAMES NOW STATIONED IN JAPAN.

105
00:05:49.261 --> 00:05:52.656
FOLLOWS THE STORY
CLOSELY AND WITH INTEREST.

106
00:05:53.614 --> 00:05:56.399
Doyle: HE SAW WHAT HAPPENED
IN LITTLE ROCK IN 1957

107
00:05:56.443 --> 00:05:59.576
AND THAT WAS AMERICAN
COMBAT TROOPS

108
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:03.537
DELIVERING JUSTICE FOR
AMERICAN SCHOOL CHILDREN.

109
00:06:04.712 --> 00:06:06.148
Narrator: WHEN MEREDITH LEAVES

110
00:06:06.191 --> 00:06:09.020
THE RAPIDLY INTEGRATING
WORLD OF THE MILITARY.

111
00:06:09.064 --> 00:06:12.372
HE RETURNES TO A MISSISSIPPI
STILL MIRED IN INEQUALITY.

112
00:06:13.677 --> 00:06:16.288
HE MAKES A DECISION THAT
WOULD CHANGE HISTORY.

113
00:06:17.594 --> 00:06:22.294
James Meredith: I CAME BACK WITH
THE PLAN TO FORCE

114
00:06:22.338 --> 00:06:24.688
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
INTO A POSITION

115
00:06:24.732 --> 00:06:27.735
WHERE THEY HAD TO USE
THE MILITARY MIGHT

116
00:06:27.778 --> 00:06:32.609
TO SUPPORT MY RIGHTS
OF CITIZENSHIP.

117
00:06:32.653 --> 00:06:34.655
Narrator: NO BLACK
STUDENT HAD ATTENDED

118
00:06:34.698 --> 00:06:38.789
THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI
IN ITS 113 YEAR HISTORY.

119
00:06:39.747 --> 00:06:41.139
Reporter: JAMES.
WHY DO YOU WANT TO ENTER

120
00:06:41.183 --> 00:06:43.098
THE UNIVERSITY
OF MISSISSIPPI?

121
00:06:43.141 --> 00:06:46.449
James Meredith: I THINK THAT
EVERY CITIZEN SHOULD HAVE

122
00:06:46.493 --> 00:06:50.845
AN OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE
EDUCATION IN HIS OWN STATE.

123
00:06:53.891 --> 00:06:54.805
Jackson: HE TOOK THE SYSTEM ON.

124
00:06:54.849 --> 00:06:55.676
HE TOOK IT ON.

125
00:06:57.895 --> 00:07:00.724
WHEN YOU THINK OF THAT. ITHINK ABOUT A GUY WHO WAS BOLD.

126
00:07:02.334 --> 00:07:07.122
COURAGEOUS. SMART. MARCHED
TO THE BEAT OF HIS OWN DRUM.

127
00:07:07.165 --> 00:07:08.558
Gilliam: THE UNIVERSITY
OF MISSISSIPPI.

128
00:07:08.602 --> 00:07:11.866
IT WAS THE SYMBOL
OF WHITE SUPREMACY.

129
00:07:12.823 --> 00:07:15.826
THE THOUGHT AT THAT
POINT OF A BLACK PERSON

130
00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:18.481
ENROLLING AND
ATTENDING THAT SCHOOL

131
00:07:18.525 --> 00:07:23.486
WAS BEYOND THE IMAGINATION
OF SO MANY PEOPLE.

132
00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:26.707
Narrator: JAMES
SAW AN OPPORTUNITY

133
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.537
IN RECENTLY ELECTED
PRESIDENT JOHN KENNEDY.

134
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.628
James Meredith: JOHN KENNEDY WAS
A SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS

135
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:37.761
THAT HAD NEVER EVEN THOUGHT
ABOUT THE BLACK ISSUE.

136
00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:41.939
BUT HE KNEW THE POLITICAL
POWER OF THE BLACK WHITE ISSUE.

137
00:07:44.202 --> 00:07:47.902
THE DAY HE GOT
INAUGURATED. THE NEXT DAY.

138
00:07:47.945 --> 00:07:49.947
I DROPPED MY LETTER IN THE MAIL.

139
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.778
Narrator: OLE MISS SENDS
AN ENCOURAGING RESPONSE

140
00:07:54.822 --> 00:07:56.432
AND JAMES REPLIES.

141
00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.739
James Meredith: I'M VERY
PLEASED WITH YOUR LETTER

142
00:07:58.782 --> 00:08:01.306
THAT YOU RECENTLY SENT TO ME.

143
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.744
I SINCERELY HOPE
THAT YOUR ATTITUDE

144
00:08:03.787 --> 00:08:05.441
TOWARD ME DOES NOT CHANGE

145
00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.357
UPON LEARNING THAT I AM
NOT A WHITE APPLICANT.

146
00:08:10.228 --> 00:08:12.492
Narrator: WITHIN
DAYS OLE MISS RESPONDS.

147
00:08:14.145 --> 00:08:16.539
JAMES WILL NOT BE
ALLOWED TO REGISTER.

148
00:08:19.673 --> 00:08:22.414
HE KNOWS HIS CAMPAIGN WOULD
END UP IN THE COURTS.

149
00:08:23.328 --> 00:08:26.027
FOR THAT HE WILL
NEED LEGAL SUPPORT.

150
00:08:26.897 --> 00:08:31.772
James Meredith: IT WAS MEDGAR
EVERS THAT FIRST SUGGESTED

151
00:08:31.815 --> 00:08:35.036
THAT I CONTACT THE NAACP

152
00:08:35.079 --> 00:08:39.431
OF WHICH HE WAS THE TOP PERSON
IN THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI.

153
00:08:39.475 --> 00:08:44.480
HE PUT ME IN TOUCH WITH THE
NAACP LEGAL DEFENSE FUND.

154
00:08:46.482 --> 00:08:50.094
Narrator: IN 1954. THE
LEGAL DEFENSE FUND HAD WON

THE CASE OF BROWN VERSUS
BOARD OF EDUCATION

156
00:08:53.489 --> 00:08:54.969
WHICH EXPLICITLY OUTLAWED

157
00:08:55.012 --> 00:08:57.972
RACIAL SEGREGATION
IN PUBLIC EDUCATION.

158
00:09:00.191 --> 00:09:03.194

00:09:03.238 --> 00:09:04.718

162
00:09:13.814 --> 00:09:17.774
James Meredith: I HAD
ENGAGED IN A WAR AGAINST

163
00:09:18.732 --> 00:09:23.301
THE ORGANIZED POWER OF
THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI.

164
00:09:24.607 --> 00:09:26.130
Narrator: AND
MEREDITH'S WAR IS ABOUT

165
00:09:26.174 --> 00:09:29.481

00:09:30.657 --> 00:09:31.527
Angry Student: GO HOME NIGGER.

167
00:09:33.007 --> 00:09:34.269

169
00:09:40.841 --> 00:09:44.105

00:09:46.281 --> 00:09:48.805
JAMES MEREDITH HAS CHOSEN
TO FIGHT HIS BATTLE

171
00:09:48.849 --> 00:09:51.721
FOR BLACK EQUALITY BY
CHALLENGING OLE MISS

172
00:09:51.765 --> 00:09:55.333
TO ENROLL HIM AS IT'S FIRST
AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENT.

173
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.902
BUT THE FORCES OPPOSING HIM

174
00:09:58.946 --> 00:10:02.079
STRETCHED FAR BEYOND THE
UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION.

175
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:06.518
ALL THE WAY TO THE STATE'S
GOVERNOR. ROSS BARNETT.

176
00:10:07.911 --> 00:10:10.479
Barnett Jr.: MY FATHER WAS BORNWAY OUT IN THE COUNTRY

177
00:10:10.522 --> 00:10:14.657
IN CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. 1898.

178
00:10:15.136 --> 00:10:16.790
HE WAS BORN. AS HE SAID.

179
00:10:16.833 --> 00:10:20.271
60 MILES FROM A RAILROAD
AND 60 MILES FROM A BANK.

180
00:10:20.315 --> 00:10:22.273
THEN HE WENT TO LAW
SCHOOL AT OLE MISS.

181
00:10:23.231 --> 00:10:25.233
MY FATHER LIKED BLACK FOLKS.

182
00:10:25.276 --> 00:10:29.106
BUT HE BELIEVED THAT THE
LORD MADE WHITE FOLKS.

183
00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.849
BLACK FOLKS. YELLOW FOLKS.
RED FOLKS. WHATEVER.

184
00:10:34.198 --> 00:10:36.287
AND THAT WAS AN
INTENTION OF THE LORD.

185
00:10:36.331 --> 00:10:38.115
Narrator: AND BARNETT
HAD RUN FOR GOVERNOR

186
00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:40.901
ON AN EXPLICITLY
RACIST PLATFORM.

187
00:10:42.163 --> 00:10:46.167
Barnett: FRIENDS. I'M A
MISSISSIPPI SEGREGATIONIST

188
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.212
AND I AM PROUD OF IT.

189
00:10:48.256 --> 00:10:51.041
Doyle: ROSS BARNETT WAS AFRAID
OF BEING KILLED POLITICALLY

190
00:10:51.085 --> 00:10:53.174
THE MOMENT THAT THE SUN ROSE

191
00:10:53.217 --> 00:10:55.480
ON THE DAY THAT
MEREDITH GOES TO SCHOOL.

192
00:10:55.524 --> 00:10:58.745
HE WAS DESPERATELY TRYING
TO SALVAGE HIS OWN CAREER.

193
00:10:58.788 --> 00:11:00.834
Narrator: DAYS
AFTER THE SUPREME COURT

194
00:11:00.877 --> 00:11:02.531
DECISION IN MEREDITH'S FAVOR.

195
00:11:02.574 --> 00:11:04.576
BARNETT DRAWS A LINE
IN THE SAND.

196
00:11:05.752 --> 00:11:08.450
Barnett: I HAVE SAID IN EVERY
COUNTY IN MISSISSIPPI

197
00:11:08.493 --> 00:11:11.627
THAT NO SCHOOL IN OUR STATE WILL

198
00:11:11.671 --> 00:11:14.586
BE INTEGRATED WHILE
I AM YOUR GOVERNOR.

199
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.240
Narrator: THE
STATE OF MISSISSIPPI

200
00:11:16.284 --> 00:11:19.766
IS NOW IN OPEN REBELLION
AGAINST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

201
00:11:19.809 --> 00:11:22.682
BOTH SIDES KNOW THE FACE
OFF COULD LEAD TO BLOODSHED

202
00:11:23.552 --> 00:11:26.598
AND AT THE MIDDLE OF IT
ALL IS JAMES MEREDITH.

203
00:11:28.339 --> 00:11:29.776
Williams: I THINK THERE
WERE THOSE WITHIN

204
00:11:29.819 --> 00:11:32.126
THE CIVIL RIGHTS
COMMUNITY WHO UNDERSTOOD

205
00:11:32.169 --> 00:11:34.171
HOW SIGNIFICANT THIS MOMENT WAS.

206
00:11:34.215 --> 00:11:35.651
I THINK THERE WERE
OTHERS WHO UNDERSTOOD

207
00:11:35.695 --> 00:11:37.914
HOW DANGEROUS THIS
UNDERTAKING WAS.

208
00:11:37.958 --> 00:11:40.308
THERE WAS NO GUARANTEE
IN SEPTEMBER OF '62

209
00:11:40.351 --> 00:11:42.571
THAT MEREDITH WAS GONNA
COME OUT OF THIS ALIVE.

210
00:11:42.614 --> 00:11:47.141
James Meredith: I EXPECTED
TO BE KILLED.

211
00:11:47.184 --> 00:11:49.143
Narrator: ON
SEPTEMBER THE 20TH.

212
00:11:49.186 --> 00:11:51.754

00:11:51.798 --> 00:11:53.974
James Meredith: ALL THE
STUDENTS WERE OUT THERE.

214
00:11:54.017 --> 00:11:56.541
THEY WERE CUSSING
AND ALL OF THAT.

215
00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:06.116
James Meredith: FIRST. HE ASKED
WHICH ONE IS JAMES MEREDITH

216
00:12:07.422 --> 00:12:10.730
AND I WAS THE ONLY BLACK
ANYWHERE ON THE CAMPUS.

217
00:12:11.818 --> 00:12:14.298
Narrator: BARNETT
REFUSES TO ADMIT MEREDITH.

218
00:12:15.517 --> 00:12:17.606
Barnett Jr.: HE WAS DOING
EVERYTHING HE COULD LEGALLY

219
00:12:17.649 --> 00:12:22.654
AND SOME MAY SAY ILLEGALLY TO
KEEP MEREDITH OUT OF OLE MISS.

220
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.614
Narrator: MEREDITH'S
LEGAL TEAM OBTAINS

221
00:12:25.657 --> 00:12:27.485
A COURT ORDER
PROHIBITING BARNETT

222

226
00:12:35.624 --> 00:12:37.713

227
00:12:37.757 --> 00:12:39.541
Reporter: DO YOU EXPECT
THAT THE BOARD WILL COMPLY?

228
00:12:39.584 --> 00:12:41.891

COURT THEY WOULD.

229
00:12:41.935 --> 00:12:43.806

259
00:14:26.387 --> 00:14:29.477

266
00:15:07.950 --> 00:15:09.430
I LOVE HER PEOPLE.

267
00:15:11.214 --> 00:15:14.043

Narrator: THE NEXT DAY.

269
00:15:19.222 --> 00:15:23.618
THOUSANDS OF US TROOPS MOBILIZE

270
00:15:24.575 --> 00:15:26.490
James Meredith: THAT WAS
MY ONLY CONCERN

271
00:15:26.534 --> 00:15:29.972
WAS WHAT THE UNITED STATES
MILITARY WAS GONNA DO.

272
00:15:30.016 --> 00:15:34.063
AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES AND HIS ADVISORS

273
00:15:34.107 --> 00:15:37.849
WERE THE ONLY PEOPLE
THAT DETERMINED THAT.

274
00:15:37.893 --> 00:15:40.504
AND THOSE WERE THE ONLY
PEOPLE I EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT.

275
00:15:43.943 --> 00:15:46.206
Narrator: MEREDITH'S
CONFRONTATION WITH BARNETT

276
00:15:46.249 --> 00:15:48.295

00:15:49.252 --> 00:15:51.080
AND IT IS ABOUT TO
ESCALATE FURTHER.

278
00:15:56.520 --> 00:16:00.133
Narrator: BY SUNDAY.
SEPTEMBER THE 30TH 1962.

279

CAMPAIGN TO INTEGRATE OLE MISS

HUNDRED FEDERAL MARSHALS

WHERE MEREDITH WILL TRY TO
REGISTER THE NEXT MORNING.

286
00:16:25.332 --> 00:16:27.812
Wilkie: I DREW THIS THE
DAY AFTER THE RIOT.

287
00:16:27.856 --> 00:16:31.816
IT ACCOMPANIED ABOUT A 10-PAGE
LETTER I SENT MY MOTHER

288
00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:36.865
WHO HAD GRADUATED
FROM OLD MISS IN 1931.

289
00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:42.827
A CROWD OF STUDENTS
GATHERED IN THE AREA.

290
00:16:42.871 --> 00:16:46.092
THE CIRCLE RIGHT IN FRONT
OF THE LYCEUM BUILDING.

291
00:16:46.962 --> 00:16:49.747
I'D SAY THERE WERE
500 OF US THERE.

292
00:16:49.791 --> 00:16:52.011
IT WAS LARGELY A CURIOUS CROWD.

293
00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.840
Schieffer: I HAD JUST GOTTEN OUT
OF THE U.S. AIR FORCE.

294
00:16:55.884 --> 00:16:57.190
AND I WENT BACK TO WORK AT THIS

295
00:16:57.233 --> 00:17:00.019
LITTLE RADIO STATION
IN FORT WORTH

296
00:17:00.062 --> 00:17:02.499
AND THE STATION SENT ME DOWN

297
00:17:02.543 --> 00:17:05.241
TO OLE MISS TO COVER THIS STORY.

298
00:17:05.285 --> 00:17:09.245
I DROVE ALL NIGHT. GOT INTO
OXFORD ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON

299
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:12.770
AND ALREADY THERE WERE CROWDS
FORMING ON THE STREETS.

300
00:17:12.814 --> 00:17:16.339
I STARTED HEARING THUDS
AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE TRUCK

301
00:17:16.383 --> 00:17:17.427
AND IT TURNED OUT THAT THEY WERE

302
00:17:17.471 --> 00:17:19.603
THROWING ROCKS AND BEER BOTTLES.

303
00:17:19.647 --> 00:17:21.866
Wilkie: IT BEGAN TO GET
A LITTLE BIT UGLY.

304
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:26.871
THERE WERE A FEW STUDENTS WHO
WERE PROVOKING THE SITUATION.

305
00:17:26.915 --> 00:17:30.440
TAUNTING THE MARSHALS.
THROWING ROCKS.

306
00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:31.746
Schieffer: THE HIGHWAY PATROL

307
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:34.357
WHO HAD BEEN THERE.
SUDDENLY LEFT.

308
00:17:44.237 --> 00:17:45.890
Wilkie: OUTSIDERS WHO
HAD NOT BEEN ABLE

309
00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:47.631
TO GET ONTO THE CAMPUS SUDDENLY

310
00:17:47.675 --> 00:17:51.157
CAME POURING INTO THE
CAMPUS WITH THEIR GUNS

311
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:54.247
TO DEFEND THE SOVEREIGNTY
OF MISSISSIPPI

312
00:17:54.290 --> 00:17:56.640
OR WHATEVER THEY
CLAIMED THEY WERE DOING.

313
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:06.128
Narrator: THAT EVENING.
AS CHAOS CONTINUES ON CAMPUS.

314
00:18:06.172 --> 00:18:08.130
KENNEDY ATTEMPTS TO
CALM THE SITUATION.

315
00:18:09.827 --> 00:18:13.483
Kennedy: AMERICANS ARE FREE AND
SURE TO DISAGREE WITH THE LAW.

316
00:18:13.527 --> 00:18:15.137
BUT NOT TO DISOBEY IT.

317
00:18:15.181 --> 00:18:17.661
Barnett: EVERY PUBLIC OFFICIAL.
INCLUDING MYSELF.

318
00:18:17.705 --> 00:18:21.100
SHOULD BE PREPARED TO
MAKE THE CHOICE TONIGHT

319
00:18:21.143 --> 00:18:22.753
WHETHER HE WILL SUBMIT

320
00:18:22.797 --> 00:18:26.105
OR WHETHER HE IS
WILLING TO GO TO JAIL.

321
00:18:33.938 --> 00:18:35.462
Schieffer: AS DARK CAME ON.

322
00:18:35.505 --> 00:18:38.465
THEY STARTED THROWING MOLOTOV
COCKTAILS AT THE MARSHALS

323
00:18:38.508 --> 00:18:42.033
AND THE MARSHALS WOULD
THEN COUNTER WITH TEAR GAS.

324
00:18:43.905 --> 00:18:46.081
Reporter: CHUCK.
THE SITUATION IS BAD.

325
00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:49.563
THE MARSHALS ARE STILL
FIRING TEARGAS SHELLS

326
00:18:49.606 --> 00:18:52.000
AND EXPLODING ALL
OVER THE PLACE.

327
00:18:52.043 --> 00:18:56.918
Meek: THAT WENT ON ALL
NIGHT. TEAR GAS. BULLETS.

328
00:18:56.961 --> 00:19:00.574
SO OPPRESSIVE. THE ONLY WAY
WE STAYED THE WHOLE NIGHT

329
00:19:00.617 --> 00:19:02.141
IS TO GET ON OUR BELLIES

330
00:19:02.184 --> 00:19:04.012
AND IF YOU GOT DOWN REAL LOW.

331
00:19:04.055 --> 00:19:06.232
THE TEAR GAS WOULD BE ABOVE
AND YOU COULD STAY DOWN THERE.

332
00:19:13.369 --> 00:19:15.197
Schieffer: AND THEN THE WORST
THING HAD HAPPENED.

333
00:19:15.241 --> 00:19:18.853
WE HEARD GUNSHOTS AND
REALIZED THERE WAS A SNIPER

334
00:19:18.896 --> 00:19:21.464
OR AT LEAST ONE
SNIPER. MAYBE TWO.

335
00:19:21.508 --> 00:19:23.814
WHO WERE UP ON THE ROOF
OF ONE OF THE DORMS

336
00:19:23.858 --> 00:19:26.077
AND THEY WERE SHOOTING

YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHO THEY
WERE GOING TO SHOOT AT.

338
00:19:30.038 --> 00:19:33.084
YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHERE
THOSE BULLETS WERE GOING.

339
00:19:34.869 --> 00:19:37.088
Gilliam: ONE OF THE PEOPLE THEYHATED MOST WERE JOURNALISTS

340
00:19:37.132 --> 00:19:39.830
WHO WERE COMING BACK AND TELLING

341
00:19:39.874 --> 00:19:43.182
THE OUTSIDE WORLD
WHAT THINGS WERE LIKE.

342
00:19:43.225 --> 00:19:44.966
AND AS A BLACK REPORTER.

343
00:19:45.009 --> 00:19:48.665
THERE WOULD BE NO WAY THAT
I COULD'VE GOTTEN ON CAMPUS

344
00:19:48.709 --> 00:19:50.537
BECAUSE IT WAS
JUST TOO DANGEROUS.

345
00:19:56.282 --> 00:19:58.327
Narrator: AS
VIOLENCE ESCALATES.

346
00:19:58.371 --> 00:20:00.242
FEDERAL MARSHALS ESCORT MEREDITH

347
00:20:00.286 --> 00:20:02.984
TO A CAMPUS DORM
UNDER HEAVY SECURITY.

348
00:20:08.555 --> 00:20:11.601
IN A FRANTIC BID TO
CONTROL THE SITUATION.

349
00:20:11.645 --> 00:20:14.822
PRESIDENT KENNEDY PERSONALLY
CALLS GOVERNOR BARNETT.

350
00:20:40.413 --> 00:20:42.545
Williams: THERE IS A DEGREE OF
THEATER IN THE NEGOTIATIONS

351
00:20:42.589 --> 00:20:44.460
THAT ARE TAKING PLACE BETWEEN

352
00:20:44.504 --> 00:20:47.071
GOVERNOR BARNETT AND THE
KENNEDY ADMINISTRATION.

353
00:20:47.115 --> 00:20:48.551
AND PART OF THAT
POLITICAL THEATER

354
00:20:48.595 --> 00:20:51.206
IS PREDICATED ON THE
DESIRE OF BOTH CAMPS

355
00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.729

00:21:08.441 --> 00:21:10.138
THE MORNING OF THE RIOT.

361

Meek: THERE WERE A LINE OF
JEEPS THAT WERE 12-WIDE

369
00:21:32.378 --> 00:21:35.816
ALL THE WAY OVER THE
FIELDS TO THE HIGHWAY.

370
00:21:35.859 --> 00:21:37.818
WHICH WAS A LONG WAY.

371
00:21:37.861 --> 00:21:40.647
THEY HAD TAKEN THIS
COMMUNITY AND LOCKED IT DOWN.

372
00:21:42.736 --> 00:21:44.912

00:21:55.575 --> 00:21:58.578
INTO A CRISIS THAT IN THE END

378
00:21:58.621 --> 00:22:02.756
OPENED THE GATES OF HIGHER
EDUCATION FOR ALL AMERICANS.

379
00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:05.498
WHICH IS A SPECTACULAR
ACHIEVEMENT.

380

TROOPS RESTORED ORDER.

WOUNDS TO FEDERAL MARSHALS.

Schieffer: THE REPORTER
WHO WAS KILLED

386
00:22:28.956 --> 00:22:30.610
WAS FOR AGENCE

387
00:22:30.653 --> 00:22:32.176
HE HAD BEEN SENT THERE BECAUSE

388
00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:34.701
SOMEBODY IN HIS OFFICE.
IT WAS THEIR DAY OFF.

389
00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.924
Wickham: RAY GUNTER WAS A YOUNG
MAN FROM ABBEVILLE. MISSISSIPPI.

390
00:22:40.968 --> 00:22:44.798
AND HE CAME DOWN TO SEE
WHAT ALL THE FUSS WAS ABOUT.

391
00:22:44.841 --> 00:22:46.365
HE WAS A LOCAL GUY WHO WAS

392
00:22:46.408 --> 00:22:48.323
IN THE WRONG PLACE
AT THE WRONG TIME.

393
00:22:55.243 --> 00:22:58.115
Narrator: THAT SAME MORNING
IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE RIOT.

394
00:22:58.159 --> 00:23:01.249
MEREDITH BEGINS HIS FIRST DAY
AS A STUDENT AT OLE MISS.

395
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:05.427
Meek: I COULD NEVER FORGET
SEEING JAMES STEP OUT THAT DORM

396
00:23:05.471 --> 00:23:10.432
AND I THOUGHT AT THE TIME.
"GOLLY. WHAT A BRAVE MAN."

397
00:23:10.693 --> 00:23:12.652
BECAUSE. HELL. I WAS SCARED.

398
00:23:12.695 --> 00:23:14.784
AND I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.

399
00:23:14.828 --> 00:23:17.570
BUT HE WAS STRONG. STEADFAST.

400
00:23:17.613 --> 00:23:20.877
AND MADE HIS WAY. AND
HE WAS DETERMINED.

401
00:23:22.531 --> 00:23:23.619
Reporter: SIR.
THERE'S BEEN A GREAT DEAL

402
00:23:23.663 --> 00:23:25.534
OF TURMOIL AND CONFLICT.

403
00:23:25.578 --> 00:23:26.927
TWO PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED.

404
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.407
DO YOU HAVE ANY
FEELINGS OF GUILT.

405
00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.800
HAVE YOU GIVEN IT
ANY SECOND THOUGHTS?

406
00:23:30.844 --> 00:23:33.237
James Meredith: I'M VERY
SORRY THAT ANYONE

407
00:23:33.281 --> 00:23:36.197
HAD TO GET HURT OR KILLED.

408
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.851
BUT. OF COURSE. I DON'T
BELIEVE ANY OF YOU BELIEVE

409
00:23:37.894 --> 00:23:39.896
THAT I HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

410
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:49.515
Narrator: JAMES
HAD WON THE BATTLE.

411
00:23:52.779 --> 00:23:54.868
IT HAS TAKEN 16 MONTHS

412
00:23:54.911 --> 00:23:57.174
AND THE LARGEST MOBILIZATION
OF FEDERAL TROOPS

413
00:23:57.218 --> 00:23:59.873
ON U.S. SOIL SINCE
THE CIVIL WAR.

414
00:24:01.091 --> 00:24:03.877
James Meredith: I FELT THAT
I HAD ACCOMPLISHED

415
00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:08.359
A SMALL PART OF MY MISSION.

416
00:24:08.403 --> 00:24:10.884
Narrator: OLE MISS
IS NO LONGER SEGREGATED.

417
00:24:14.844 --> 00:24:18.500
James Meredith: AT NINE. I
ATTENDED MY FIRST CLASS.

418
00:24:18.544 --> 00:24:23.070
IT WAS A COURSE IN
COLONIAL AMERICAN HISTORY.

419
00:24:23.113 --> 00:24:24.680
I WAS A FEW MINUTES LATE

420
00:24:25.681 --> 00:24:29.250
AND WAS GIVEN A SEAT AT
THE BACK OF THE ROOM.

421
00:24:31.252 --> 00:24:36.257
I REMEMBER A GIRL. THE
ONLY GIRL THERE I THINK.

422
00:24:36.605 --> 00:24:38.781
AND SHE WAS CRYING.

423
00:24:38.825 --> 00:24:43.438
BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FROM
THE TEARGAS IN THE ROOM.

424
00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:46.006
I WAS CRYING FROM IT MYSELF.

425
00:24:46.049 --> 00:24:47.573
Meek: I THOUGHT.
"GOSH. SOMEBODY.

426
00:24:47.616 --> 00:24:49.618
"I GOTTA GET A PICTURE
OF HIM IN THE CLASSROOM."

427
00:24:49.662 --> 00:24:53.404
SO. I TOOK A NIKON. AND
I PUT ON MY TRENCH COAT.

428
00:24:53.448 --> 00:24:55.145
AND WHEN JAMES WENT IN
THE FIRST CLASSROOM.

429
00:24:55.189 --> 00:24:57.800
I JUST SNAPPED AS BEST I COULD.

430
00:25:00.542 --> 00:25:03.240
AND THE CLASS BEGAN TO EMPTY.

431
00:25:03.284 --> 00:25:05.504
INCLUDING THE INSTRUCTOR

432
00:25:05.547 --> 00:25:07.244
AND THERE WAS JAMES BY HIMSELF

433
00:25:08.855 --> 00:25:10.421
AND THAT WAS A POWERFUL MOMENT.

434
00:25:20.649 --> 00:25:23.347
Narrator: MEREDITH
EMBARKS ON HIS STUDIES.

435
00:25:23.391 --> 00:25:26.612
SPURNED BY THE VAST MAJORITY
OF HIS FELLOW STUDENTS.

436
00:25:28.048 --> 00:25:31.225
BUT THE THREAT OF
VIOLENCE IS EVER PRESENT.

437
00:25:36.796 --> 00:25:39.581
Narrator: SOON AFTER MEREDITH
BEGINS HIS SECOND SEMESTER.

438
00:25:39.625 --> 00:25:42.976
MEREDITH'S CLOSE FRIEND
MEDGAR EVERS IS MURDERED.

439
00:25:48.677 --> 00:25:52.246
SHOT IN THE BACK IN THE
DRIVEWAY OF HIS HOME.

440
00:26:05.607 --> 00:26:07.348
Evers: I'VE HAD A
NUMBER OF THREATENING CALLS.

441
00:26:07.391 --> 00:26:10.525
PEOPLE CALLING ME SAYING
THAT THEY WERE GONNA KILL ME.

442
00:26:10.569 --> 00:26:12.745
SAYING THEY WERE
GONNA BLOW MY HOME UP

443
00:26:12.788 --> 00:26:17.097
AND SAYING THAT I ONLY
HAD A FEW HOURS TO LIVE.

444
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.752
I SAID "WELL. WHENEVER
MY TIME COMES I'M READY".

445
00:26:28.195 --> 00:26:30.023
Narrator: JUST
A FEW MONTHS LATER.

446
00:26:30.066 --> 00:26:31.546
JAMES REACHES THE GOAL

447
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:33.548
THAT MEDGAR EVERS
HELPED HIM TO REALIZE.

448
00:26:35.289 --> 00:26:36.986
University Dean:
JAMES HOWARD MEREDITH.

449
00:26:46.126 --> 00:26:48.650
Narrator: TODAY.
NEARLY 60 YEARS LATER.

450
00:26:48.694 --> 00:26:51.653
ONE IN 10 STUDENTS AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI

451
00:26:51.697 --> 00:26:53.612
IS AFRICAN AMERICAN.

452
00:26:53.655 --> 00:26:55.875
Student: CAN I
SHAKE YOUR HAND?

453
00:26:55.918 --> 00:26:57.746
James Meredith: I'M GLAD
TO SEE YOU HERE.

454
00:27:01.097 --> 00:27:02.838
Narrator: WHILE
INTEGRATING OLE MISS

455
00:27:02.882 --> 00:27:04.448
IS A LANDMARK VICTORY.

456
00:27:07.364 --> 00:27:09.889
FOR JAMES THE BATLLE
WASN'T OVER.

457
00:27:11.542 --> 00:27:13.457
James Meredith: THE
CONCEPT OF CIVIL RIGHTS

458
00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:16.156
IS THAT WE GOOD WHITE FOLKS

459
00:27:17.287 --> 00:27:20.508
WILL HELP YOU GET
SOME OF YOUR RIGHTS.

460
00:27:20.551 --> 00:27:21.640
THREE OR FOUR OF THEM.

461
00:27:22.684 --> 00:27:26.645
IF YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU
DON'T HAVE ALL THE RIGHTS WE DO.

462
00:27:26.688 --> 00:27:29.648
Doyle: HE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT
THE TRADITIONAL VOCABULARY

463
00:27:29.691 --> 00:27:34.261
AND IMAGERY OF THE AMERICAN
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT

464
00:27:34.304 --> 00:27:38.482
WAS SOMEHOW INDICATED WEAKNESS

465
00:27:38.526 --> 00:27:42.486
OR INFERIORITY OR SUPPLICATION.

466
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:47.535
James Meredith: CIVIL RIGHTS IS
AN INSULT TO CITIZENSHIP.

467
00:27:48.275 --> 00:27:51.234
EVERY CITIZEN IN
THE UNITED STATES

468
00:27:52.888 --> 00:27:55.848
IS ENTITLED TO EVERY
ONE OF THOSE RIGHTS.

469
00:27:55.891 --> 00:27:57.763
Judy Meredith: HIS THING WAS.

470
00:27:57.806 --> 00:28:00.940
"IF YOU GIVE ME SOME
CIVIL RIGHTS.

471
00:28:00.983 --> 00:28:03.856
"WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF THE
RIGHTS I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE?"

472
00:28:11.559 --> 00:28:15.955
James Meredith: THE
PSYCHOLOGY OF VIOLENCE

473
00:28:15.998 --> 00:28:20.220
IS EVEN MORE USED
THAN ACTUAL VIOLENCE.

474
00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:24.006
Williams: FOR MEREDITH. IT WAS
THIS OVERWHELMING FEAR

475
00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:25.660
THAT HE UNDERSTOOD MOST BLACKS

476
00:28:25.704 --> 00:28:28.141
STILL EXPERIENCE
IN THE DEEP SOUTH

477
00:28:28.184 --> 00:28:30.621
WHEN JUST TRYING TO
EXERCISE BASIC CIVIL RIGHTS.

478
00:28:30.665 --> 00:28:31.971
EVEN SOMETHING AS A SIMPLE

479
00:28:32.014 --> 00:28:33.799
AS GETTING A HAMBURGER
IN A RESTAURANT.

480
00:28:33.842 --> 00:28:36.279
AND GOD FORBID. TRYING TO
GO TO REGISTER TO VOTE.

481
00:28:40.066 --> 00:28:43.069
James Meredith: YOU UNDERSTAND.
LYNCHING HAD BEEN

482
00:28:43.112 --> 00:28:45.724
A KEY FACTOR OF THE FEAR.

483
00:28:45.767 --> 00:28:50.729
BUT IT WAS ALMOST
FINISHED IN THE '60S.

484
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.296
BUT THE FEAR WAS STILL THERE.

485
00:28:54.297 --> 00:28:57.126
Narrator: BY 1966.
JUST FIVE PERCENT

486
00:28:57.170 --> 00:29:00.477
OF BLACKS IN MISSISSIPPI
ARE REGISTERED TO VOTE.

487
00:29:00.521 --> 00:29:03.263
ASSERTING THEIR RIGHT COULD
BE A DANGEROUS UNDERTAKING.

488
00:29:04.873 --> 00:29:06.962
MEREDITH. DETERMINED
TO DRAW ATTENTION

489
00:29:07.006 --> 00:29:09.486
TO THE FEAR THAT BLACK
PEOPLE EXPERIENCED.

490
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:13.795
EMBARKS ON HIS NEXT GREAT
MISSION. A WALK AGAINST FEAR.

491
00:29:13.839 --> 00:29:16.102
Reporter: JAMES MEREDITH.
A VETERAN NEGRO LEADER

492
00:29:16.145 --> 00:29:18.495
SET OFF ON FOOT FROM
MEMPHIS. TENNESSEE

493
00:29:18.539 --> 00:29:22.891
TO JACKSON. MISSISSIPPI. TO
CONQUER FEAR. MEREDITH SAID.

494
00:29:22.935 --> 00:29:25.764
Narrator: HE AIMES
TO WALK 220 MILES.

495
00:29:25.807 --> 00:29:28.941

496
00:29:28.984 --> 00:29:32.640
James Meredith: I CALL IT MY
SECOND ASSAULT ON MISSISSIPPI.

497
00:29:33.772 --> 00:29:36.296
Narrator: THE MARCHES FROM
SELMA TO MONTGOMERY. ALABAMA

498
00:29:36.339 --> 00:29:37.819
THE PREVIOUS YEAR

499
00:29:37.863 --> 00:29:41.823
HAD ENCOURAGED THIS
FORM OF PROTEST.

500
00:29:41.867 --> 00:29:43.477
BUT TRUE TO CHARACTER.

501
00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:45.609
MEREDITH HAS SOMETHING
DIFFERENT IN MIND.

502
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.961
HE'D WALK BY HIMSELF.

503
00:29:49.004 --> 00:29:52.878
Wright: HE HAD INFORMED OTHER
LEADERS OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS

504
00:29:52.921 --> 00:29:54.705
WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO.

505
00:29:54.749 --> 00:29:57.230
AND SOME OF THEM SCOFFED AT
HIM. SOME LAUGHED AT HIM.

506
00:29:57.273 --> 00:29:58.971
NOW SOME OF THEM SAID. "OH.
MAN. YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

507
00:29:59.014 --> 00:30:00.320
YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIVE.

508
00:30:00.363 --> 00:30:01.974
YOU KNOW. THEY'RE
GONNA KILL YOU

509
00:30:02.017 --> 00:30:05.107
IF THEY SEE A BLACK MAN
WALKING DOWN AN INTERSTATE."

510
00:30:05.151 --> 00:30:08.458
James Meredith: WHEN I TOLD THEM
I WAS GONNA DO. THEY LAUGHED.

511
00:30:11.548 --> 00:30:15.509
THEY SAID GO HEAD HOME. DIRT
FARMER BLACK FROM MISSISSIPPI

512
00:30:15.552 --> 00:30:16.771
WITH YOUR IGNORANT SELF.

513
00:30:17.685 --> 00:30:20.383
AND YOU KNOW. I SAID OKAY.

514
00:30:21.471 --> 00:30:23.125
YOU'RE ALL SO SMART
AND I'M SO DUMB.

515
00:30:23.169 --> 00:30:24.823
WE'RE GONNA SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

516
00:30:24.866 --> 00:30:26.737
Wright: HE DOESN'T NEED ANYONE'S
PERMISSION TO DO IT.

517
00:30:26.781 --> 00:30:28.435
WHETHER THEY AGREE
WITH HIM OR NOT.

518
00:30:28.478 --> 00:30:30.916
IT DOESN'T MATTER TO HIM
BECAUSE HE'S ON A MISSION

519
00:30:30.959 --> 00:30:33.527
AND HE KNOWS THAT
HE'S ON A MISSION.

520
00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.268
Williams: MEREDITH HAD
NEVER CONCEIVED

521
00:30:35.311 --> 00:30:37.357
OF THIS AS A MARCH
OR DEMONSTRATION.

522
00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.228
HE MADE THIS SHARP DISTINCTION

523
00:30:39.272 --> 00:30:43.624
BETWEEN DEMONSTRATIONS AND
MARCHES AND WHAT HE WAS DOING.

524
00:30:43.667 --> 00:30:46.322
AND HE BASICALLY SAID
THIS WALK AGAINST FEAR

525
00:30:46.366 --> 00:30:48.585
WAS TO RECLAIM A
RIGHT THAT EVERY

526
00:30:48.629 --> 00:30:50.239
AMERICAN SHOULD BE ENTITLED TO.

527
00:30:50.283 --> 00:30:53.764
IT WAS ABOUT RECLAIMING
FOR BLACKS IN MISSISSIPPI.

528
00:30:53.808 --> 00:30:55.766
AND IN FACT. IN AMERICA.

529
00:30:55.810 --> 00:30:57.812
THIS SENSE OF BEING ENTITLED TO.

530
00:30:57.856 --> 00:31:01.468
JUST THE BASIC ACCOUTREMENTS
OF CITIZENSHIP.

531
00:31:01.511 --> 00:31:03.600
Narrator: AS MEREDITH
HAD BEEN AT OLE MISS.

532
00:31:03.644 --> 00:31:08.040
HE IS ONE MAN. ALONE.
SEEKING TO CHANGE THE WORLD.

533
00:31:08.083 --> 00:31:09.693
Doyle: IT WAS JAMES MEREDITH.

534
00:31:09.737 --> 00:31:12.392
IN A PITH HELMET WITH A
FEW DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET

535
00:31:12.435 --> 00:31:16.700
AND A CANE. SAID. "WE'RE
GONNA DEMONSTRATE OUR COURAGE

536
00:31:16.744 --> 00:31:18.093
AND THE WORKERS
AND THE CITIZENS

537
00:31:18.137 --> 00:31:19.703
OF EVERY TOWN WE GO THROUGH.

538
00:31:19.747 --> 00:31:22.576
I'M GONNA ASK THEM TO
GO REGISTER TO VOTE."

539
00:31:22.619 --> 00:31:25.579
NOW. REGISTERING TO VOTE.
EVEN IN 1966 IN MISSISSIPPI.

540
00:31:25.622 --> 00:31:29.409
COULD GET YOU. AS A BLACK
MAN OR A WOMAN. KILLED.

541
00:31:30.627 --> 00:31:32.064
Narrator: ON THE SECOND DAY.

542
00:31:32.107 --> 00:31:33.717
HE CROSSES THE STATE
LINE FROM TENNESSEE.

543
00:31:34.849 --> 00:31:37.591
THE EYES OF MISSISSIPPI
ARE NOW UPON HIM.

544
00:31:37.634 --> 00:31:39.201
James Meredith: ABOUT THE
TOP OF THE HILL.

545
00:31:39.245 --> 00:31:41.464
SOMEBODY CAME UP AND TOLD ME

546
00:31:41.508 --> 00:31:44.554
THERE'S A MAN DOWN THERE WAITING
SAYS HE'S GONNA SHOOT YOU.

547
00:31:45.512 --> 00:31:46.992
I SHOOK IT OFF.

548
00:31:47.035 --> 00:31:49.995
I'D HAD MANY THREATS
IN MY LIFETIME.

549
00:31:50.038 --> 00:31:52.084
IT DIDN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL.

550
00:31:54.303 --> 00:31:58.568
AND I GOT DOWN HERE AND
I HEARD SOMEBODY SAY.

551
00:31:58.612 --> 00:32:00.962
"JAMES MEREDITH.

552
00:32:01.006 --> 00:32:02.964
EVERYBODY ELSE.
GET OUT OF THE WAY.

553
00:32:03.008 --> 00:32:05.445
I ONLY WANT JAMES MEREDITH."

554
00:32:05.488 --> 00:32:07.012
AND THEN A MAN HAD COME UP OUT

555
00:32:07.055 --> 00:32:09.579
OF ONE OF THESE
DITCHES OVER THERE

556
00:32:11.277 --> 00:32:12.539
AND HE SHOT ME TWO TIMES.

557
00:32:18.023 --> 00:32:20.373
I'M HIT IN THE LEG I
KNOW AND IN THE HEAD.

558
00:32:20.416 --> 00:32:22.027
AIN'T NOBODY GOING
TO GET ME IN THE CAR?

559
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:23.506
Man: HERE IT COMES RIGHT NOW.
HERE IT IS.

560
00:32:29.991 --> 00:32:31.471
Reporter: POLICE FIND A MAN

561
00:32:31.514 --> 00:32:33.342
WITH A SHOTGUN
HIDING IN THE BUSHES.

562
00:32:33.386 --> 00:32:35.170
James Meredith: THE ONLY THING
SIGNIFICANT TO ME AT THAT POINT.

563
00:32:35.214 --> 00:32:37.129
HE DIDN'T KILL ME.

564
00:32:37.172 --> 00:32:38.695
Reporter: AND NO ONE ASKS HIM

565
00:32:38.739 --> 00:32:41.568
FOR AN EXPLANATION AND
NONE SEEMS REQUIRED.

566
00:32:41.611 --> 00:32:45.964
James Meredith: NOW. FRANKLY. I
DID NOT PLAN TO GET SHOT.

567
00:32:48.183 --> 00:32:54.842
BUT AFTER I GOT SHOT. EVERYTHING
I HAD HOPED FOR HAPPENED.

568
00:32:55.277 --> 00:32:56.975
Narrator: THE DAY
AFTER MEREDITH IS SHOT.

569
00:32:57.018 --> 00:32:59.542
LEADERS FLY INTO
MEMPHIS FROM ALL FIVE

570
00:32:59.586 --> 00:33:03.024
OF THE NATION'S MAJOR
CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS.

571
00:33:03.068 --> 00:33:06.114
THE SO CALLED BIG FIVE
HAVE ARRIVED IN TOWN.

572
00:33:08.899 --> 00:33:11.076
THE MOVEMENT HAS
BEEN SPLINTERING

573
00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:14.122
WITH SOME PUSHING TO
TURN UP HEAT ON TACTICS.

574

Malcolm X: THE DAY
OF THE SIT-IN.

575

THE LIE-IN. THE CRAWL-IN.

576
00:33:19.954 --> 00:33:24.002
THE CRY-IN AND THE
BEG-IN IS OUTDATED.

577
00:33:24.872 --> 00:33:28.093
Narrator: AND THEY DID
NOT AGREE ON THE NEXT STEPS

578
00:33:28.136 --> 00:33:31.792
Williams: DR. KING DOES NOT WANT
TO REPUDIATE ANY GROUP.

579
00:33:31.835 --> 00:33:34.447
BUT HE IS PUT IN AN
UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION

580
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:37.537
BY FLOYD MCKISSICK.
AND STOKELY CARMICHAEL.

581
00:33:39.191 --> 00:33:40.888
THEY WANT A MARCH
IN WHICH BLACKS

582
00:33:40.931 --> 00:33:42.411
WERE GONNA TAKE
A LEADERSHIP ROLE

583
00:33:42.455 --> 00:33:44.370
IN WHICH THEY WILL NOT
ESCHEW NONVIOLENCE.

584
00:33:44.413 --> 00:33:47.112
IN WHICH THERE SHOULD
BE ARMED SELF-DEFENSE.

585
00:33:47.155 --> 00:33:50.463
WHITNEY YOUNG AND ROY WILKINS
CAN'T SIGN ON TO THIS.

586
00:33:51.725 --> 00:33:53.074
James Meredith: BUT
THE OTHER QUESTION.

587
00:33:53.118 --> 00:33:54.597
"COULD STOKELY CARMICHAEL

588
00:33:54.641 --> 00:33:57.774
USE BLACK POWER?"

589
00:33:58.819 --> 00:34:01.604
AND I SAID STOKELY
CARMICHAEL IS A CITIZEN

590
00:34:01.648 --> 00:34:04.085
HE CAN SAY ANYTHING
HE WANNA SAY.

591
00:34:07.741 --> 00:34:12.006
Dr. King: THIS MARCH. THAT

00:39:19.748 --> 00:39:21.315
FOR A SEAT IN CONGRESS.

672
00:39:25.101 --> 00:39:29.497
BY THE 1970S. HE TURNS
HIS FOCUS TO WALL STREET.

673
00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.675
James Meredith: SINCE I LEFT
MISSISSIPPI SEVEN YEARS AGO.

674
00:39:33.719 --> 00:39:36.417
I'VE SPENT ALMOST ALL
OF MY TIME IN NEW YORK

675
00:39:36.461 --> 00:39:39.855
STUDYING HOW THE CAPITALIST
ECONOMIC SYSTEM WORKS

676
00:39:39.899 --> 00:39:44.294
AND ABOUT THE ACCUMULATION
AND RETAINING OF WEALTH.

677
00:39:44.338 --> 00:39:48.734
BUT THIS HAS NOT REACHED
BLACKS. EVERYONE AGREES WITH ME.

678
00:39:48.777 --> 00:39:50.779
Narrator: HIS
DECISIONS IN LATER LIFE

679
00:39:50.823 --> 00:39:53.652
HAVE SOMETIMES BEEN UNEXPECTED.

680
00:39:53.695 --> 00:39:57.525
IN 1989. HE JOINS THE STAFF
OF SENATOR JESSE HELMS.

681
00:39:57.569 --> 00:40:00.093
AN ARCH CONSERVATIVE
WHO CONSISTENTLY

682
00:40:00.136 --> 00:40:02.704
OPPOSED CIVIL
RIGHTS LEGISLATION.

683
00:40:02.748 --> 00:40:05.881
Doyle: JAMES MEREDITH WENT
TO WORK FOR JESSE HELMS.

684
00:40:05.925 --> 00:40:10.233
THE FORMER ARCH SEGREGATIONIST
OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE.

685
00:40:10.277 --> 00:40:14.934
AT THE TIME. JESSE HELMS
HAD RENOUNCED SEGREGATION

686
00:40:14.977 --> 00:40:18.894
AS A LEGAL DOMINANT THEORY IN
AMERICA. HE HAD REJECTED IT.

687
00:40:20.287 --> 00:40:23.682
Narrator: AND IN 1991.
HE ENDORSES DAVID DUKE.

688
00:40:23.725 --> 00:40:28.121
FORMER KKK LEADER FOR
GOVERNOR OF LOUISIANA.

689
00:40:28.164 --> 00:40:30.297
James Meredith: I ALWAYS
THOUGHT MY JOB WAS

690
00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:34.083
TO CONVERT BAD WHITE FOLKS
INTO GOOD WHITE FOLKS.

691
00:40:34.127 --> 00:40:37.739
I CONSIDER ONE OF MY MOST
SIGNIFICANT VICTORIES

692
00:40:37.783 --> 00:40:42.744
CONVERTING DAVID DUKE FROM A
KLANSMAN TO A FORMER KLANSMAN.

693
00:40:43.615 --> 00:40:47.183
Doyle: DUKE. AT THE TIME.
HAD RENOUNCED THE KLAN.

694
00:40:47.227 --> 00:40:50.056
JAMES MEREDITH THOUGHT
DUKE WAS A FORMER RACIST.

695
00:40:50.099 --> 00:40:52.493
NOW. I THINK HE WAS
PROBABLY WRONG THERE.

696
00:40:53.886 --> 00:40:55.801
Narrator: MEREDITH
REMAINS A FREE THINKING

697
00:40:55.844 --> 00:40:57.846
CHALLENGER TO THE STATUS QUO.

698
00:40:59.065 --> 00:41:01.502
NOT AFRAID TO SIDE
WITH A PERCEIVED ENEMY

699
00:41:01.546 --> 00:41:04.331
IN ORDER TO OPEN UP
AND FACE A DEBATE.

700
00:41:07.813 --> 00:41:10.380
43 YEARS AFTER HE GRADUATED.

701
00:41:10.424 --> 00:41:14.602
OLE MISS ERECTED A STATUE
TO HONOR JAMES MEREDITH.

702
00:41:14.646 --> 00:41:16.735
Kellum: SOME OF OUR
STUDENTS CAME TOGETHER

703
00:41:16.778 --> 00:41:19.955
TO DISCUSS WHAT COULD
THE UNIVERSITY DO

704
00:41:21.087 --> 00:41:24.394
AND THEY ALL FELT WE SHOULD
HAVE A CIVIL RIGHTS MONUMENT.

705
00:41:26.179 --> 00:41:28.442
Lewis: BECAUSE OF INDIVIDUALS
LIKE JAMES MEREDITH.

706
00:41:30.009 --> 00:41:32.794
Kellum: WE WANTED THE
MONUMENT LOCATED BETWEEN

707
00:41:32.838 --> 00:41:36.102
THE LYCEUM THAT
REJECTED MR. MEREDITH

708
00:41:36.145 --> 00:41:39.366
AND THE LIBRARY THAT
WAS MR. MEREDITH'S

709
00:41:39.409 --> 00:41:41.237
OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN KNOWLEDGE.

710
00:41:43.544 --> 00:41:45.894
OH. MY FAVORITE
PART OF THIS WAS.

711
00:41:45.938 --> 00:41:49.245
I LOOKED OUT ONE DAY AND
THERE WAS A LITTLE CHILD.

712
00:41:49.289 --> 00:41:50.899
PROBABLY SEVEN OR EIGHT.

713
00:41:50.943 --> 00:41:52.422
WHO WAS ON A SCHOOL TOUR.

714
00:41:52.466 --> 00:41:56.165
WHO WAS HOLDING MR.
MEREDITH'S STATUE'S HAND

715
00:41:56.209 --> 00:41:58.864
AND I MUST TELL YOU.
I HAD TEARS THAT DAY.

716
00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:09.527
Narrator: OLE MISS HAS
MADE PROGRESS SINCE 1962.

717
00:42:16.751 --> 00:42:18.536
Barnett: I LOVE MISSISSIPPI.

718
00:42:20.712 --> 00:42:24.542
Narrator: IN JULY
2018. AT THE AGE OF 85.

719
00:42:24.585 --> 00:42:28.937
JAMES IS INDUCTED INTO THE
OLE MISS ALUMNI HALL OF FAME.

720
00:42:30.243 --> 00:42:32.898
Judy Meredith: THEY PUT JAMES
ON THE 50-YARD LINE.

721
00:42:34.421 --> 00:42:39.426
THE WHOLE STADIUM STOOD
UP AND JUST APPLAUDED.

722
00:42:41.036 --> 00:42:42.951
Speaker: MR.
JAMES MEREDITH.

723
00:42:42.995 --> 00:42:46.389
[CROWD CHEERING]

724
00:42:46.433 --> 00:42:48.609
Judy Meredith: THAT IS A HECK
OF AN ACCOMPLISHMENT

725
00:42:48.653 --> 00:42:50.568
FOR MISSISSIPPI

726
00:42:50.611 --> 00:42:53.222
AND I HOPE IT CONTINUES
TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION.

727
00:43:00.316 --> 00:43:01.622
Narrator: MEREDITH
REMAINS COMMITTED

728
00:43:01.666 --> 00:43:03.711
TO THE FIGHT HE
STARTED IN MISSISSIPPI

729
00:43:03.755 --> 00:43:06.322
MORE THAN 50 YEARS AGO.

730
00:43:06.366 --> 00:43:07.976
James Meredith: WE'VE GOT
TO HAVE A NEW AGENDA

731
00:43:09.804 --> 00:43:14.809
IF BLACKS ARE EVER TO BECOME
FULL CITIZENS IN THIS COUNTRY

732
00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:17.856
AND ENJOY ALL OF THE
RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES.

733
00:43:17.899 --> 00:43:20.641
Gilliam: THE LEGACY
OF KNOWING THAT.

734
00:43:20.685 --> 00:43:22.861
AS A BLACK PERSON IN AMERICA.

735
00:43:22.904 --> 00:43:24.906
THERE ARE CHANCES
YOU ARE GONNA HAVE

736
00:43:24.950 --> 00:43:28.040
TO TAKE IN ORDER TO
BRING ABOUT CHANGE.

737
00:43:28.083 --> 00:43:30.651
Williams: THE CLASSIC
INDIVIDUAL WHO BELIEVES

738
00:43:30.695 --> 00:43:33.045
IT'S THEIR RESPONSIBILITY
TO INTERROGATE

739
00:43:33.088 --> 00:43:34.655
AND CONSTANTLY
PUSH THE BOUNDARIES

740
00:43:34.699 --> 00:43:36.788
OF OUR DEMOCRACY
TO MAKE IT BETTER.

741
00:43:38.485 --> 00:43:40.966
Judy Meredith: NOT CARING
ABOUT WHAT ANYBODY

742
00:43:41.009 --> 00:43:46.014
ELSE THINKS ABOUT HIM. I
THINK THAT'S HIS LEGACY.

743
00:43:47.799 --> 00:43:50.279
Narrator: ULTIMATELY.
HE FORCES US TO CONFRONT

744
00:43:50.323 --> 00:43:54.022
ONE SIMPLE BUT PROFOUNDLY
POWERFUL QUESTION.

745
00:43:54.066 --> 00:43:57.286
James Meredith: AM I A CITIZEN
OR AM I NOT A CITIZEN?
