that there's no justice here.

73
00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.078
There is no justice. no rule of law.

74
00:18:41.161 --> 00:18:43.914
There are no state institutions.

75
00:18:48.794 --> 00:18:54.007
In this state. fear prevails.

76
00:18:54.091 --> 00:18:56.343

We will hold Governor Javier Duarte

That includes students.
academics. and everyday citizens.

84
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:45.475
We started to see a surge
in the number of disappearances in 2010.

85
00:19:45.559 --> 00:19:47.352
once Javier Duarte took office.

86
00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:51.315
The state police took him.
and we haven't heard from him since.

87
00:19:51.398 --> 00:19:54.985
We are here in the name of all the mothers

I THINK… THEREFORE.
THEY DISAPPEAR ME!

95
00:20:33.190 --> 00:20:36.526
The violence is getting worse.
and we're starting to worry

96
00:20:36.610 --> 00:20:40.822
because it turns out
we're exactly what they need.

97
00:20:41.615 --> 00:20:44.910
We can't forget our friends
who've been killed for speaking the truth.

98
00:20:44.993 --> 00:20:47.371
So we have to cover our faces
when we go out.

99
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.343
Here. you're seen as a commodity.

100
00:21:01.426 --> 00:21:03.887
If you're a woman.
they kidnap you for sex trafficking.

101
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:06.723
If you're a student.
they put you to work as a hit man.

FRIENDS OF NADIA AND RUBÉN

107
00:22:40.067 --> 00:22:42.778
All we wanted was a peaceful protest.

108
00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:45.238
As soon as the cops
started beating demonstrators.

109
00:22:45.322 --> 00:22:50.494
I ran into this photojournalist.
and I asked him to take pictures.

110
00:22:51.828 --> 00:22:55.999
Because this photographer
came over and started taking photos.

111
00:22:56.750 --> 00:23:00.420
this made the police stop
what they were doing.

112
00:23:09.721 --> 00:23:12.849
I was detained by undercover officers.

113
00:23:12.933 --> 00:23:14.976
They beat me and took me away.

114
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:17.604
and I was put
in a patrol car all by myself.

115
00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:23.652
They'd been ordered to bring us all in

116
00:23:23.735 --> 00:23:25.737
so they could ID us.

117
00:23:31.743 --> 00:23:34.079
It was an enforced disappearance.

118
00:23:34.162 --> 00:23:36.873
I was never booked in.
They left me on the side of the road.

119
00:23:36.957 --> 00:23:40.752
But two of the women in our group
<i>were </i>taken to the San José station.

120
00:23:40.836 --> 00:23:42.879
The police made them strip naked

121
00:23:42.963 --> 00:23:47.217
and made them do
the typical exercises like squats.

122
00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:52.347
They humiliate women like that

123
00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:56.393
because they treat us
like the spoils of war.

124
00:24:03.233 --> 00:24:04.985
I kept snapping photos.

125
00:24:05.068 --> 00:24:10.449
and this guy from the Veracruz government
grabbed me

126
00:24:10.532 --> 00:24:16.204
and told me to stop or I'd end up
like my colleague Regina Martínez.

what brought you to leave Veracruz?

I had to leave
because I was being threatened.

157
00:29:24.471 --> 00:29:27.307
It happened right after
the attack on the college students.

158
00:29:27.390 --> 00:29:30.268
It was brutal.
The attackers even used machetes.

Don't you have families?

162
00:30:49.138 --> 00:30:55.144
This vicious attack was carried out
by ten men armed with guns.

163
00:30:55.228 --> 00:30:57.272
machetes. bats. and sticks.

164
00:30:57.355 --> 00:31:00.400
They beat and stabbed these young men
with machetes

165
00:31:00.483 --> 00:31:04.070
while the victims
were celebrating a birthday.

166
00:31:04.571 --> 00:31:07.907

and Arturo Bermúdez Zurita.

168
00:31:11.995 --> 00:31:14.998
We found a group of young men
who had been beaten.

169
00:31:15.081 --> 00:31:19.377
-They claim they were refused assistance.
-No. it's just the protocol is different.

170
00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:21.754
This isn't the first time.

171
00:31:21.838 --> 00:31:26.175
In Coatzacoalcos. police have been accused
of abducting young people.

172
00:31:26.259 --> 00:31:29.679
Whole families have been silenced.
It's not the first time the police--

173
00:31:29.762 --> 00:31:31.514
It's easy to point fingers.

174
00:31:31.598 --> 00:31:36.936
We are doing our jobs.
The Prosecutor's Office is investigating.

175
00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:40.398
The students claim they were preparing
food for poor children.

176
00:31:40.481 --> 00:31:43.902
But their neighbors say
they were having a wild party.

177
00:31:43.985 --> 00:31:45.403
It's not my place to say.

178
00:31:45.486 --> 00:31:49.365
But I can assure you.
my team played no role in this incident.

179
00:32:15.808 --> 00:32:18.937
This one morning.
I saw someone watching me.

180
00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:22.899
I didn't think it was a big deal.
so I headed to work. like usual.

181
00:32:22.982 --> 00:32:24.901
When I left my house. there were three men

182
00:32:24.984 --> 00:32:27.362
on the corner.
next to a cab with the engine running.

183
00:32:27.445 --> 00:32:30.323
I saw one of them snap a photo

184
00:32:30.406 --> 00:32:33.743
and gesture to me as if to say.
"What are you looking at?"

185
00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:45.630
As I walked past them.
they came towards me

186
00:32:45.713 --> 00:32:49.050
and knocked into me.

187
00:32:49.133 --> 00:32:51.594
-They wanted you to know they were there.
-Yeah.

188
00:32:51.678 --> 00:32:54.472
-And that they were coming for <i>you</i>.
-Correct.

189
00:33:02.981 --> 00:33:06.651
Given the current situation.

190
00:33:06.734 --> 00:33:10.947
we can't take these attacks
and threats lightly

191
00:33:11.030 --> 00:33:13.116
because there's no telling
what could happen.

192

MEXICO CITY

193
00:33:55.199 --> 00:34:00.997
This has taken a toll
on me psychologically. emotionally.

194
00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:03.833
as well as financially.

195
00:34:05.334 --> 00:34:08.046
Enough already
with the martyrs and heroes.

196
00:34:08.129 --> 00:34:11.758
We have to remember that we are human

197
00:34:11.841 --> 00:34:15.803
and we can't fix everything overnight.

198
00:34:15.887 --> 00:34:18.765

00:37:02.511 --> 00:37:05.556
This is not being handled

221
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:10.561
by the Veracruz government.

222
00:37:10.645 --> 00:37:15.608
It's being overseen by an administration
that belongs to another political party.

223
00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:30.081
<i>I can't reveal too much information.</i>

Our fellow reporter--

233
00:38:28.264 --> 00:38:32.768
-Let's maintain order.
-He didn't just leave Veracruz.

234
00:38:32.852 --> 00:38:34.020
He fled.

235
00:38:34.103 --> 00:38:37.898
And he told everyone
that Governor Javier Duarte

236
00:38:37.982 --> 00:38:40.234
should be blamed
if anything happened to him.

237

All I can say is--

All right. look.

240
00:38:45.197 --> 00:38:50.244
We're obviously looking
at all lines of investigation.

241
00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:56.083
What worries us most
is that this Prosecutor's Office

242

243
00:38:58.377 --> 00:39:02.006

255
