* When they told me
I was young *

5
00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:17.150
* Hey *

6
00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:21.421
* I thought that
you'd be happy *

7
00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:25.225
* I'll sing your name
and  I'll sing it loud *

8
00:00:25.258 --> 00:00:30.296
* 'cause where I'm from there's
no reason to doubt you *

* I'll sing your name
and I'll sing it loud *

00:00:38.438 --> 00:00:40.340
Here we go. Juniper.

12
00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:43.143
Your dad and I wanted
to save this one for last.

13
00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:46.346
It's a special gift
for a very special Junebug.

14
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:50.550
It's a Junebug. just like me.

15
00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:52.252
That's right.

16
00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:55.822
This box is meant to be your
very own little time capsule.

17
00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.124
Really? That's amazing.

18
00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.460
But what should I put in it?

19
00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:01.628
It's up to you. kiddo.

20
00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:04.631
Could be things you'll wanna
look at when you're older.

21
00:01:04.664 --> 00:01:06.766
Like wishes? In a wish box!

22
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.602
That's terrific. bug.
You're so creative.

23
00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:10.837
Okay.

24
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.206
I know where I can get
some inspiration.

25
00:01:13.239 --> 00:01:15.375
My favorite book.

26
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.383
And when the princess and her
knight defeated the ogre.

27
00:01:23.416 --> 00:01:27.220
she found herself
miraculously transformed

28
00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.856
from a terrifying werewolf.
to once again.

29
00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:31.524
a beautiful princess.

30
00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:36.262
First. I wish everyone in
my kingdom will be happy.

31
00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:40.433
Second. I want all my dreams
to come true.

32
00:01:41.968 --> 00:01:45.705
Third. I wish someday I will
find my knight.

33
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:49.642
May all your wishes come true.

34
00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:51.644
Happy birthday. Junebug.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:56.683
* I sing your name *

Hey. Micah.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.450
Hey. Your Americano's
on the bar.

56
00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:04.451
Thank you.

57
00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:06.486
My rocket fuel for the day.

58
00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:13.393
Uh. excuse me.
Excuse me.

59
00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:15.295
I think you might have
my coffee.

60
00:03:15.328 --> 00:03:16.896
Yeah. I guess you're right.

61
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.332
This doesn't taste like
a caramel latte.

62
00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:22.535
It's not a caramel latte. it's
an Americano. and it's mine.

63
00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.004
Well. it was mine.

64
00:03:24.037 --> 00:03:26.272
Whoopsies. My mistake. Juniper.

65
00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:27.540
I'll fetch you a new one.

66
00:03:27.574 --> 00:03:29.576
Couldn't you tell it
wasn't what you ordered?

67
00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.977
I didn't really think
about it to be honest.

68
00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:32.579
I order something
new every day.

69
00:03:32.612 --> 00:03:35.582
-I stick with what I like.
-Here you go. one Americano.

70
00:03:35.615 --> 00:03:37.517
Oh. thank you. Um...

71
00:03:38.018 --> 00:03:39.986
This is yours and. no...

72
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.022
This... this one's. no...
Yes? Yours?

73
00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:44.491
-Yeah. I'll take that.
-I'll take this one.

74
00:03:44.524 --> 00:03:46.493
You know what.
I'll make you a new one.

75
00:03:46.526 --> 00:03:48.628
-Okay. Well...
-I have my coffee.

76
00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:49.896
And I have no coffee.

77
00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:51.331
Well. have a good day.

78
00:03:51.364 --> 00:03:53.466
Yeah. you too.

[pleasant music]

80
00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:03.810
Morning.

81
00:04:03.843 --> 00:04:05.845
-Hi Kylie.
-Good morning.

82
00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.452
[alerts chiming]

83
00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:15.855
Coming to the meeting?
It's starting now.

84
00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:16.856
Sure.

85
00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:21.828
So. our focus this past year
has skewed toward young adult

86
00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:23.463
and graphic novels.

87
00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:26.599
Where we're falling behind
is in picture book offerings.

88
00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:29.836
People. we are a small company.
virtually the only in-print

89
00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:33.540
left that hasn't been swallowed
up by one of the conglomerates.

90
00:04:33.573 --> 00:04:36.643
So. I'm opening this up to
all of you. to help us find

91
00:04:36.676 --> 00:04:40.613
the next great picture book and
bring us back into that arena.

92
00:04:40.647 --> 00:04:43.083
Paula. I'm sure we'd all
love as much

93
00:04:43.116 --> 00:04:45.418
guidance as possible
from you.

94
00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:47.120
Well. for starters...

95
00:04:47.153 --> 00:04:50.824
no more animal. monster.
or cute alien protagonists.

96
00:04:50.857 --> 00:04:52.792
That was two seasons ago.

97
00:04:52.826 --> 00:04:56.963
But. the key for us
is always going to be in

98
00:04:56.996 --> 00:04:58.865
finding an amazing
new illustrator.

99
00:04:58.898 --> 00:05:02.736
So. any thoughts there.
any ideas?

100
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.338
Nope? Okay. fine.

101
00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:07.007
Well. put the word out.

102
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.644
I wanna see some pitches. even
early concepts. by end of week.

103
00:05:12.512 --> 00:05:13.847
Okay.

104
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.981
That's it.

105
00:05:15.015 --> 00:05:16.616
Juniper. Can I have a word?

106
00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:22.022
I can't downsize anymore.
It's all hands on deck.

107
00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:24.057
We're all happy to pitch in.
Paula.

108
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:26.559
I know the pool seems
shallow right now.

109
00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:29.396
but I am positive that there's
still some fantastic

110
00:05:29.429 --> 00:05:31.097
undiscovered talent out there.

111
00:05:31.131 --> 00:05:32.866
I certainly hope so.

112
00:05:32.899 --> 00:05:36.036
You've been swamped
with administration
the past few months.

113
00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.038
and it's not really
the editor's job.

114
00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:40.006
but you have the best eye here.

115
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.608
I left a few
prospects on your desk.

116
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:43.810
-Have a look.
-Yeah. Happy to.

117
00:05:43.843 --> 00:05:45.412
You're a rockstar. Juniper.

118
00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:47.514
Rock on.

119
00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:54.521

Dropping by after work
with something special.

121
00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:04.798
I regret ever teaching you
where to find the emojis. Mom.

122
00:06:08.668 --> 00:06:09.669
Okay.

123
00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:15.608

[knock at door]
It's us. dear!

125
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:24.718
Coming!

126
00:06:25.752 --> 00:06:26.753
Hey. where's Dad?

127
00:06:26.786 --> 00:06:27.754
He's coming.

128
00:06:27.787 --> 00:06:28.788
Dad. are you coming?

129
00:06:28.822 --> 00:06:29.823
I'm coming!

130
00:06:29.856 --> 00:06:32.659
I told him I'd help.
he would have none of it.

131
00:06:32.692 --> 00:06:33.426
So stubborn!

132
00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.161
Mom. I need
this to be quick.

133
00:06:35.195 --> 00:06:36.930
because I'm meeting
Ethan for dinner tonight.

134
00:06:36.963 --> 00:06:38.998
I have a bunch of submissions
from work to review.

135
00:06:39.032 --> 00:06:42.102
Look what I found cleaning out
the basement. [chuckles]

136
00:06:42.135 --> 00:06:42.969
Ta-da!

137
00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:43.903
What is it?

138
00:06:43.937 --> 00:06:45.572
Don't you recognize it?

139
00:06:45.605 --> 00:06:46.940
It's your wish box.

140
00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:49.476
Your time capsule
from when you were eight.

141
00:06:49.509 --> 00:06:50.744
Don't you remember?

142
00:06:50.777 --> 00:06:52.812
I don't know. vaguely...
I guess?

143
00:06:52.846 --> 00:06:55.215
We thought you might want it
since you've got

144
00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.617
a big birthday coming up.
[whispers] 4-0.

145
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.854
And you got me this instead of.
I don't know. a blender

146
00:07:00.887 --> 00:07:02.856
or something I could
actually use.

147
00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:06.059
It's a chance for
you to reconnect with
the dreams you had

148
00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.660
when you were
a young girl.

149
00:07:08.862 --> 00:07:11.698
And why do I need to reconnect
with them exactly?

150
00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:15.101
Is it 'cause I'm not doing well
in my life. in my career?

151
00:07:15.135 --> 00:07:16.169
It's just. it's...

152
00:07:16.202 --> 00:07:18.938
We can't remember the last time
that we saw you...

153
00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:20.707
Smile. That old Junebug smile.

154
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.276
And birthday parties used
to make you smile. and...

155
00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:25.211
It's been a long time
since you had one

156
00:07:25.245 --> 00:07:26.880
and we could help.

157
00:07:26.913 --> 00:07:29.049
Dad. I don't really have time
for birthday parties. Okay?

158
00:07:29.082 --> 00:07:32.052
I'm very busy and
I really need to get dressed.

159
00:07:32.085 --> 00:07:33.286
Of course. of course.

160
00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:35.055
We've got euchre
tonight anyway.

161
00:07:35.088 --> 00:07:36.656
Uh. we were just
dropping by.

162
00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.857
Yep. Just dropping by.

163
00:07:37.891 --> 00:07:40.026
I hear it when just one
of you says it.

164
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:42.562
Don't forget you're coming
for dinner tomorrow night.

165
00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:44.130
-Dinner tomorrow night.
-Yup. dinner tomorrow night.

166
00:07:44.164 --> 00:07:45.231
Okay.

167
00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:46.700
[exhales]

168
00:07:48.902 --> 00:07:51.905
[upbeat music]

169
00:07:57.911 --> 00:08:01.281
I'm getting the team ready for
this tech symposium we're doing

170
00:08:01.314 --> 00:08:03.550
and the managers just
keep micromanaging

171
00:08:03.583 --> 00:08:04.851
our process development.

172
00:08:04.884 --> 00:08:07.554
They want market projections.
sales projections.

173
00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:08.722
finance projections.

174
00:08:08.755 --> 00:08:10.657
Sounds like a lot of projection.

175
00:08:10.690 --> 00:08:11.524
Exactly.

176
00:08:11.558 --> 00:08:13.693
Okay. you two.
Something for dessert?

177
00:08:14.194 --> 00:08:15.662
-Just the check.
-Ooh. I--

178
00:08:16.329 --> 00:08:18.765
-Sorry. Did you want something?
-No. no. no.

179
00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:20.567
We don't normally bother
with dessert.

180
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.168
No. no. I changed
my mind. yeah.

181
00:08:22.202 --> 00:08:23.570
It's okay. Yeah.

182
00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:25.038
We'll take the check.

183
00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:26.639
Bien. Just the check.

184
00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:30.310
Listen. I wanted to ask you
a question.

185
00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:32.712
I know in the past I've
sometimes gotten you

186
00:08:32.746 --> 00:08:34.147
the wrong thing
for your birthday.

187
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.815
[chuckles]

188
00:08:35.849 --> 00:08:37.751
I thought I'd just tell you
what I was planning on getting.

189
00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:39.586
A pen.

190
00:08:40.787 --> 00:08:41.321
A pen.

191
00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:42.689
A nice one.

192
00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:44.290
Every editor needs
a quality pen. right?

193
00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:46.593
To mark up the manuscripts
you work on.

194
00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:49.062
I gave you my heart
and you gave me a pen.

195
00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:50.230
Hmm?

196
00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:52.132
It's a quote from
my favorite movie.

197
00:08:52.165 --> 00:08:53.099
"Say Anything".

198
00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:55.902
Lloyd Dobler. Diane Court.

199
00:08:56.636 --> 00:08:59.339
Oh. yeah. Right. Yeah.
I think you showed me that one.

200
00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.608
Merci. madame.

201
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:07.347
Yeah. I mean. I was thinking
that writing is really

202
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.949
more of a childhood dream
anyway.

203
00:09:09.983 --> 00:09:14.721
And Paula was even saying that
if I continue on this path

204
00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:17.257
then eventually she'll...

205
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.858
bring me into...

206
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:21.861
Hmm?

207
00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:23.863
A pen would be lovely.

208
00:09:24.664 --> 00:09:26.099
Thank you. Ethan.

209
00:09:26.132 --> 00:09:29.169
[emotional music]

210
00:09:29.202 --> 00:09:31.171
So. what about a nightcap?

211
00:09:31.938 --> 00:09:34.274
I'm a little zapped.
Had a long day at work.

212
00:09:34.307 --> 00:09:36.710
I still have a lot of files
to get through.

213
00:09:36.743 --> 00:09:38.912
Okay then. I'll just
drive you home.

214
00:09:38.945 --> 00:09:41.214
You know. actually. I think
I wanna walk.

215
00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.283
It's still such a pretty
night out.

216
00:09:43.316 --> 00:09:44.984
Well. I'll come with.

217
00:09:45.018 --> 00:09:49.089
It's okay. I'm not very far.
Thank you so much for dinner.

218
00:09:49.122 --> 00:09:50.623
I'll call you tomorrow.

219
00:09:51.758 --> 00:09:52.926
He's giving you a pen?

220
00:09:52.959 --> 00:09:55.995
It's... an early birthday
surprise.

221
00:09:56.029 --> 00:09:56.730
Some surprise.

222
00:09:56.763 --> 00:09:58.865
And see this.
this right here.

223
00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:01.968
This is why you're my best
friend because you always know

224
00:10:02.002 --> 00:10:04.771
when I need an early birthday
glass of Pinot.

225
00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:06.006
See? There are advantages

226
00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:08.274
to having your best friend
so close by.

227
00:10:08.308 --> 00:10:09.976
Plus. I had a full day

228
00:10:10.010 --> 00:10:12.112
of mothering twins
so I need this too.

229
00:10:13.913 --> 00:10:17.217
He's really giving you a
pen for your 40th birthday?

230
00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.185
He assured me it'd be
a nice one.

231
00:10:19.219 --> 00:10:21.021
You know what that
reminds me of?

232
00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:21.888
Lloyd...

233
00:10:21.921 --> 00:10:23.056
Dobler. [gasps]

234
00:10:23.089 --> 00:10:25.025
[in unison] Let's do it!

235
00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:35.301
Where's the guy in my life
holding up a boombox

236
00:10:35.335 --> 00:10:36.803
to serenade me?

237
00:10:36.836 --> 00:10:38.338
That's what I wanna know.

238
00:10:38.938 --> 00:10:42.075
Maybe you could find a guy
to hold up a phone?

239
00:10:42.909 --> 00:10:45.045
-Not the same.
-Right. Not the same.

240
00:10:45.078 --> 00:10:45.945
Nuh uh.

241
00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:12.906
[clears throat]

242
00:11:13.907 --> 00:11:17.711
I wish everyone in my kingdom
will be happy.

243
00:11:19.012 --> 00:11:20.980
Well. clearly not quite
everyone.

244
00:11:25.418 --> 00:11:29.222
I want all my dreams
to come true.

245
00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:33.827
I think we're batting
above average there.

246
00:11:38.798 --> 00:11:42.802
I wish someday...
I will find...

247
00:11:43.503 --> 00:11:45.271
my knight.

248
00:11:52.512 --> 00:11:56.016
[melancholy music]

249
00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:16.336
[magical music]

250
00:12:20.173 --> 00:12:21.174
Hello!

251
00:12:21.207 --> 00:12:23.977
[screams]

252
00:12:24.577 --> 00:12:26.112
How did you get in here?

253
00:12:26.146 --> 00:12:27.280
You scared me.

254
00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:29.282
How are you here?

255
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:32.819
Where... where are your parents
exactly?

256
00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:34.854
I'm you. and you're me.

257
00:12:34.888 --> 00:12:37.257
I've lost my mind.
It's finally happened.

258
00:12:37.290 --> 00:12:38.992
No. you haven't.

259
00:12:39.025 --> 00:12:42.195
You were born June 17th. 1984.

260
00:12:42.228 --> 00:12:44.964
Your favorite ice cream flavor
is Raspberry Swirl.

261
00:12:44.998 --> 00:12:47.467
Your mom made you take
two years of figure skating

262
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:49.202
'til you fell and chipped
a tooth.

263
00:12:49.235 --> 00:12:50.170
That made you happy

264
00:12:50.203 --> 00:12:52.205
'cause it meant you
could read more books.

265
00:12:52.238 --> 00:12:54.607
You look up words in the
dictionary you don't know

266
00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:56.042
and put a check mark next
to them--

267
00:12:56.076 --> 00:12:56.710
Okay. I get it.

268
00:12:56.743 --> 00:12:58.078
Oh! And you had a crush on--

269
00:12:58.111 --> 00:12:59.179
Okay. Okay.

270
00:12:59.212 --> 00:13:02.182
I do not need to be reminded
of ancient crushes.

271
00:13:03.483 --> 00:13:05.185
How is this possible?

272
00:13:05.218 --> 00:13:08.188
You seemed like you needed
a little help.

273
00:13:08.221 --> 00:13:09.289
And here I am.

274
00:13:09.322 --> 00:13:11.858
Did my mom put you up to this?

275
00:13:11.891 --> 00:13:14.260
[chuckles] Is this like...

276
00:13:14.294 --> 00:13:18.465
some kind of hidden camera show
or something?

277
00:13:18.498 --> 00:13:20.300
You look exactly like me.

278
00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:22.602
She gave you my old
pink overalls to wear?

279
00:13:22.635 --> 00:13:24.137
This is insane.

280
00:13:24.170 --> 00:13:25.205
I...

281
00:13:25.238 --> 00:13:28.475
I need you to go.
I need you  to go back wherever

282
00:13:28.508 --> 00:13:31.945
you came from because I have to
go to work in the morning.

283
00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:34.047
Oh. goodie!
Let's pick out our outfit.

284
00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.882
No! We're not picking out
an outfit.

285
00:13:35.915 --> 00:13:37.384
Stop right there.

286
00:13:37.417 --> 00:13:40.253
Look. I need you to go back to
wherever you came from. Okay?

287
00:13:40.286 --> 00:13:41.654
I need some sleep.

288
00:13:41.688 --> 00:13:46.026
I can't get fired because I'm...
seeing little people.

289
00:13:46.059 --> 00:13:47.394
You don't want me here?

290
00:13:47.427 --> 00:13:48.428
No.

291
00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:49.429
Fine!

292
00:13:49.462 --> 00:13:50.397
Fine.

293
00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:54.234
Okay. look...

294
00:13:54.267 --> 00:13:57.070
I don't know who you are
or where you came...

295
00:14:03.977 --> 00:14:06.546
You're perfectly fine.
Yeah. things like this happen

296
00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:08.948
to people all the time.
It's normal.

297
00:14:08.982 --> 00:14:10.950
In fact. you probably
dreamed it.

298
00:14:10.984 --> 00:14:13.453
And dreams are a perfectly
normal part of life.

299
00:14:14.287 --> 00:14:15.288
Oh. no.

300
00:14:15.321 --> 00:14:16.890
No. no. no. no. no.

301
00:14:19.392 --> 00:14:22.195
Apparently my breakdown
isn't over yet after all.

302
00:14:25.432 --> 00:14:26.366
I'm back!

303
00:14:27.167 --> 00:14:27.767
You're back.

304
00:14:27.801 --> 00:14:32.005
Those clothes are boring.

305
00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:34.074
Oh. thank you.
A little fashion critic.

306
00:14:34.107 --> 00:14:35.675
This is exactly what I need.

307
00:14:35.709 --> 00:14:38.278
Okay. well then. by all means.
what should I wear?

308
00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:40.413
That one.
So bright.

309
00:14:40.447 --> 00:14:42.115
I can't wear this to work.

310
00:14:42.148 --> 00:14:45.218
This is a stupid impulse buy.
I was just about to return it.

311
00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:46.119
[groans]

312
00:14:48.321 --> 00:14:49.456
[groans]

313
00:14:49.489 --> 00:14:53.326
Okay. Okay.
Um... there.

314
00:14:54.527 --> 00:14:55.395
Happy?

315
00:14:55.428 --> 00:14:56.429
Good.

316
00:14:56.463 --> 00:14:57.464
What am I doing?

317
00:14:59.666 --> 00:15:02.635
Stay right there.
Okay? Just...

318
00:15:02.669 --> 00:15:03.670
[dialing]

319
00:15:03.703 --> 00:15:05.105
Don't move.

320
00:15:05.672 --> 00:15:07.340
Stay right there.

321
00:15:07.374 --> 00:15:09.542
Kate. Hi.
I need you.

322
00:15:10.610 --> 00:15:12.512
Kate! Come with me.

323
00:15:12.545 --> 00:15:13.513
Okay.

324
00:15:13.546 --> 00:15:14.714
Okay. This way.

325
00:15:14.748 --> 00:15:16.983
-Where are we going?
-Right up there.

326
00:15:17.017 --> 00:15:19.452
Just right over here.

327
00:15:20.453 --> 00:15:22.022
And... [gasps]
Okay.

328
00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:24.491
Do you see what I see?

329
00:15:25.425 --> 00:15:28.128
You're thinking about
a wardrobe purge?

330
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:30.230
I did it last month.
Regret it bitterly.

331
00:15:30.263 --> 00:15:32.098
I've need to go to
the thrift store

332
00:15:32.132 --> 00:15:33.533
and buy all my stuff back.

333
00:15:33.566 --> 00:15:35.335
She can't see me
because I'm you.

334
00:15:35.368 --> 00:15:38.171
It would be like double vision
or something like that.

335
00:15:38.204 --> 00:15:39.773
What do you know about
double vision?

336
00:15:39.806 --> 00:15:43.176
I didn't think you had
that much to drink last night.

337
00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:45.011
I didn't. I was just...

338
00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:47.547
Let's get a coffee in you
and you'll be fine.

339
00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:49.549
Better get back.
Twins have swimming.

340
00:15:49.582 --> 00:15:51.418
Love the scarf on you.
by the way.

341
00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:54.054
Nothing wrong with a little
splash of color.

342
00:15:54.087 --> 00:15:56.222
Why is this happening to me?

343
00:15:56.256 --> 00:15:57.123
I'm only eight.

344
00:15:57.157 --> 00:15:59.259
I don't know
how stuff like this works.

345
00:15:59.292 --> 00:16:02.395
Believe me. I think you could
be 100 and still not know.

346
00:16:03.129 --> 00:16:04.531
[gasps] Ooh.

347
00:16:04.564 --> 00:16:07.634
I guess you gotta get back
to your publishing job.

348
00:16:07.667 --> 00:16:09.302
You got all those meetings.

349
00:16:09.836 --> 00:16:11.304
How do you know all that?

350
00:16:11.338 --> 00:16:15.175
I told you. I'm you!
Just young you.

351
00:16:15.208 --> 00:16:17.377
If you're really me.
then you should know

352
00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.413
that I don't really have
time for this right now. I...

353
00:16:24.718 --> 00:16:26.286
[sighs]

354
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.058
-What's that?

355
00:16:32.092 --> 00:16:33.526
Is that one of our books?

356
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.128
How did you get back there?

357
00:16:35.161 --> 00:16:37.330
I wanted to see what stories
we've written.

358
00:16:37.364 --> 00:16:39.499
No. I mean. what's with
the popping up

359
00:16:39.532 --> 00:16:41.201
and disappearing all the time?

360
00:16:41.234 --> 00:16:43.336
I don't know.
It's just fun.

361
00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:49.442
If that's our book...
we sure didn't get famous.

362
00:16:52.278 --> 00:16:55.849
I actually did better
than getting famous.

363
00:16:55.882 --> 00:16:58.818
I am the person who helps
writers get published.

364
00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:04.524
So... you're helping other
people tell their stories?

365
00:17:04.557 --> 00:17:05.692
Yes. exactly.

366
00:17:05.725 --> 00:17:07.627
What about our stories?

367
00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.363
What about my Junebug stories?

368
00:17:11.431 --> 00:17:15.301
Okay. this might be hard
to explain to a child.

369
00:17:15.335 --> 00:17:19.205
but when you're an adult you
have to make compromises and...

370
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:26.479
Apparently you can get too
in touch with your inner child.

371
00:17:37.657 --> 00:17:39.325
Hey. Americano's coming up.

372
00:17:39.359 --> 00:17:40.260
Thanks.

373
00:17:40.760 --> 00:17:42.629
Are you okay?

374
00:17:42.662 --> 00:17:44.497
Oh yeah. Yeah. Why?

375
00:17:44.531 --> 00:17:47.133
You just look a little
different. I guess.

376
00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:49.869
Well. yeah. I had dinner with
my boyfriend last night.

377
00:17:49.903 --> 00:17:51.638
so... probably had too much fun.

378
00:17:52.639 --> 00:17:53.673
Thank you so much.

379
00:17:53.707 --> 00:17:54.774
Yeah. have a great day.

380
00:17:54.808 --> 00:17:55.709
Okay.

381
00:17:59.913 --> 00:18:01.481
I wanna look.

382
00:18:02.949 --> 00:18:04.584
Oh. oh. oh.
What are you doing?

383
00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:06.353
But it's so pretty.

384
00:18:06.386 --> 00:18:06.920
Well. I... uh...

385
00:18:06.953 --> 00:18:07.821
[giggling]

386
00:18:07.854 --> 00:18:09.155
Oh...
[metal clangs]

387
00:18:09.622 --> 00:18:10.523
[cans thudding]

388
00:18:12.392 --> 00:18:13.426
[paint splashes]

389
00:18:13.827 --> 00:18:15.161
Oh no!

390
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:19.165
[gasps]

391
00:18:21.735 --> 00:18:23.269
[groans]

392
00:18:23.303 --> 00:18:25.772
If it isn't Miss Americano.
What a turn of events.

393
00:18:25.805 --> 00:18:27.874
Uh... I'm so sorry.

394
00:18:27.907 --> 00:18:29.142
It's okay.

395
00:18:29.676 --> 00:18:30.910
I'm so sorry.

396
00:18:30.944 --> 00:18:33.646
It's okay. It's okay.
Things happen. Okay?

397
00:18:34.481 --> 00:18:37.250
How can you say that?
I just destroyed your mural.

398
00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:39.519
No. it's a sign.
It wasn't right. anyway.

399
00:18:39.552 --> 00:18:42.355
I was thinking of starting
over. to be honest.

400
00:18:42.389 --> 00:18:44.190
You're being so nice
about this.

401
00:18:44.224 --> 00:18:45.925
It'll be even better
once I figure out

402
00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:47.527
what it's actually
supposed to be.

403
00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.695
Um...

404
00:18:49.362 --> 00:18:51.664
I might have a way
to make it up to you.

405
00:18:51.698 --> 00:18:52.732
Nothing to make up.

406
00:18:52.766 --> 00:18:54.768
Nope. Nope.
I think there is.

407
00:18:54.801 --> 00:18:58.471
It just so happens that I work
for Little Light Publishing

408
00:18:58.505 --> 00:19:00.407
and we're looking
for illustrators.

409
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.709
for new and different
illustrators.

410
00:19:02.742 --> 00:19:04.411
I think your work is...

411
00:19:04.444 --> 00:19:07.781
was beautiful and you might be
a perfect fit for us.

412
00:19:08.381 --> 00:19:11.251
I appreciate the interest.
but no thanks.

413
00:19:12.318 --> 00:19:13.219
Oh.

414
00:19:13.953 --> 00:19:15.321
You sure?

415
00:19:15.355 --> 00:19:16.423
Yeah.

416
00:19:16.456 --> 00:19:19.492
I'm just gonna finish
this mural and be on my way.

417
00:19:19.526 --> 00:19:20.460
That's what I do.

418
00:19:21.594 --> 00:19:24.330
If you don't mind. I'm gonna
start the cleanup here.

419
00:19:24.364 --> 00:19:26.399
Oh sure. Yeah. of course.

420
00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:27.467
Um...

421
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.437
Well. if you change your mind.
I'm Juniper James

422
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.605
and I work for Little Light
Publishing.

423
00:19:33.473 --> 00:19:34.741
You said. Yeah.

424
00:19:34.774 --> 00:19:35.709
-Okay.
-I got it.

425
00:19:35.742 --> 00:19:36.743
Yeah. Sorry again.

426
00:19:36.776 --> 00:19:37.977
It's okay. It's okay.

427
00:19:38.645 --> 00:19:41.448
I like him.
And his paintings are pretty.

428
00:19:41.481 --> 00:19:43.750
Well. I don't know what
to think.

429
00:19:43.783 --> 00:19:46.753
Yeah. he's intriguing.
that one.

430
00:19:46.786 --> 00:19:48.455
He's been working for over
a month

431
00:19:48.488 --> 00:19:50.457
and I still don't
know his name.

432
00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.791
Huh. Really?

433
00:19:51.825 --> 00:19:52.726
Mm-hmm.

434
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.528
Hey. do you see her?

435
00:19:58.498 --> 00:19:59.599
Do I see who?

436
00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:01.601
Nobody.

437
00:20:02.369 --> 00:20:04.304
I think I need
another espresso.

438
00:20:04.971 --> 00:20:06.306
It's on the house.

439
00:20:06.339 --> 00:20:08.475
And I'm gonna give you
my cousin's email.

440
00:20:08.508 --> 00:20:10.510
He's a really great therapist.

441
00:20:10.543 --> 00:20:12.512
Have you heard of
Imago Therapy?

442
00:20:17.617 --> 00:20:20.353
[cheerful music]

443
00:20:30.797 --> 00:20:32.065
Kylie?

444
00:20:32.098 --> 00:20:34.501
Hey. can you help me find
the right link here?

445
00:20:34.534 --> 00:20:35.402
Sure.

446
00:20:35.435 --> 00:20:36.469
Just right there.

447
00:20:39.039 --> 00:20:41.875
Wait. you're interested
in Alex Ripley?

448
00:20:41.908 --> 00:20:43.410
You know him?

449
00:20:43.443 --> 00:20:46.312
I think I may have met him
this morning.

450
00:20:46.346 --> 00:20:48.815
I was hoping to bring him in
as a new illustrator.

451
00:20:48.848 --> 00:20:52.419
He's an art world icon.
Shot straight to the top.

452
00:20:52.452 --> 00:20:54.954
It was sad though. after
his second exhibition.

453
00:20:54.988 --> 00:20:57.023
he was absolutely savaged
by the critics.

454
00:20:57.057 --> 00:20:57.957
Hmm.

455
00:20:57.991 --> 00:21:00.326
Yeah. Just brutal.

456
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:02.896
He walked out of his own
opening and hasn't signed

457
00:21:02.929 --> 00:21:04.664
a piece of artwork since.

458
00:21:04.698 --> 00:21:06.733
Word on the street is
he's the muralist

459
00:21:06.766 --> 00:21:09.569
that's been popping up
all around the city.

460
00:21:09.602 --> 00:21:12.605
Look. I don't even know if this
guy is who you said he is.

461
00:21:12.639 --> 00:21:15.475
but I really liked his artwork.

462
00:21:15.508 --> 00:21:18.745
[chuckles] All I can say is.
if you found Alex Ripley...

463
00:21:19.646 --> 00:21:20.747
nice play.

464
00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:22.749
I think we should have
a quick meeting

465
00:21:22.782 --> 00:21:23.683
now that the Brennan book

466
00:21:23.717 --> 00:21:24.818
has fallen off the spring
release list.

467
00:21:24.851 --> 00:21:25.752
Of course.

468
00:21:25.785 --> 00:21:27.454
Juniper may have stumbled

469
00:21:27.487 --> 00:21:29.889
across a new illustrator
this morning.

470
00:21:29.923 --> 00:21:32.726
Really? Well. that's great.
Show me their stuff.

471
00:21:33.593 --> 00:21:34.561
Sure.

472
00:21:34.594 --> 00:21:36.930
Well. actually that's gonna be
a little hard

473
00:21:36.963 --> 00:21:39.733
because he's a muralist.

474
00:21:39.766 --> 00:21:41.134
A muralist.

475
00:21:41.167 --> 00:21:43.470
Oh no. [laughs]
No. that's not gonna work.

476
00:21:43.503 --> 00:21:44.904
-Why not?
-Someone who works

477
00:21:44.938 --> 00:21:46.539
on such a large scale
like that?

478
00:21:46.573 --> 00:21:47.874
No. we need
illustrators. miniaturists.

479
00:21:47.907 --> 00:21:48.942
Juniper. I'm sorry.

480
00:21:48.975 --> 00:21:49.943
I think you're barking up
the wrong tree there.

481
00:21:49.976 --> 00:21:52.912
Excuse me. Paula.
Can I just get one minute?

482
00:21:52.946 --> 00:21:54.414
One minute.

483
00:21:56.649 --> 00:21:57.751
Raise your hand.

484
00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:01.421
This is not a classroom.

485
00:22:01.454 --> 00:22:03.023
We don't need to raise
our hand to speak.

486
00:22:03.056 --> 00:22:04.924
So just keep trying.

487
00:22:04.958 --> 00:22:06.126
It is not that easy.

488
00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.794
Why not?

489
00:22:07.827 --> 00:22:10.497
Wouldn't you tell me not to
give up after just trying once?

490
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.766
Well... yes. of course I would.

491
00:22:12.799 --> 00:22:13.867
Did you say something?

492
00:22:14.668 --> 00:22:15.769
Nothing.

493
00:22:15.802 --> 00:22:16.670
Okay.

494
00:22:20.607 --> 00:22:22.442
Do it or I'll scream.

495
00:22:22.475 --> 00:22:24.444
You will not.

496
00:22:24.477 --> 00:22:25.812
-[screams]
-Oh!

497
00:22:25.845 --> 00:22:27.947
Actually. I do have
something to say.

498
00:22:27.981 --> 00:22:30.617
Paula. I believe I've
tracked down an artist
who's really special

499
00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:32.519
and I don't think it matters
if he paints on walls

500
00:22:32.552 --> 00:22:35.488
or draws on papers because his
work is incredibly compelling

501
00:22:35.522 --> 00:22:37.490
and you said yourself I have the
best eye in this place.

502
00:22:37.524 --> 00:22:41.194
And so that is...
what I wanted to say.

503
00:22:41.227 --> 00:22:43.196
Okay. I shouldn't have
shut you down.

504
00:22:43.229 --> 00:22:45.165
If you're this passionate
about his work.

505
00:22:45.198 --> 00:22:46.533
I'll take a look.

506
00:22:46.566 --> 00:22:48.535
Great. Just one problem.
which is

507
00:22:48.568 --> 00:22:50.804
that he doesn't really
wanna work with us.

508
00:22:50.837 --> 00:22:52.138
I'm sorry.

509
00:22:52.172 --> 00:22:54.641
You're offering me
someone who not only
has never illustrated

510
00:22:54.674 --> 00:22:56.776
but he's not actually interested
in the job.

511
00:22:56.810 --> 00:22:57.877
This is your solve?

512
00:22:57.911 --> 00:22:59.045
Yes.

513
00:22:59.079 --> 00:23:00.847
Well. best of luck with that.
Okay.

514
00:23:02.816 --> 00:23:04.918
You do have the best eye
in the place.

515
00:23:04.951 --> 00:23:05.819
Thank you. Rob.

516
00:23:06.886 --> 00:23:08.955
Okay. listen. my workplace
has gotta be off-limits

517
00:23:08.988 --> 00:23:10.090
for these visits.

518
00:23:10.123 --> 00:23:11.858
So. let's do something
else then.

519
00:23:11.891 --> 00:23:12.826
Ice cream!

520
00:23:12.859 --> 00:23:13.993
Ice cream?

521
00:23:14.027 --> 00:23:16.196
I can't go for ice cream in
the middle of the morning.

522
00:23:16.229 --> 00:23:18.798
I'm a responsible
adult with an important job.

523
00:23:18.832 --> 00:23:20.967
Not to mention all the meetings
I have.

524
00:23:21.001 --> 00:23:23.670
Just looks like homework
for grown-ups. [shudders]

525
00:23:23.703 --> 00:23:25.538
I think you have a point there.

526
00:23:25.572 --> 00:23:27.841
Let's go talk to that painter
you like.

527
00:23:27.874 --> 00:23:29.776
I don't like him. Okay?

528
00:23:29.809 --> 00:23:33.179
I just think he has talent and
it would be mutually beneficial

529
00:23:33.213 --> 00:23:35.081
for us to... hey. where
are you going?

530
00:23:35.882 --> 00:23:37.117
Come on.

531
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:38.651
What? I...

532
00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.788
Aren't you coming?

533
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:46.860
[Paula] Juniper? My office.

534
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:48.528
Coming.

535
00:23:50.997 --> 00:23:52.799
So. what is this exactly. Mom?

536
00:23:52.832 --> 00:23:55.168
Just a new recipe I've been
meaning to try.

537
00:23:55.201 --> 00:23:57.170
Is that code for I just
threw in everything

538
00:23:57.203 --> 00:23:59.072
I happen to have laying
around the kitchen?

539
00:23:59.105 --> 00:24:00.740
-Oh. Junebug.
-Mom.

540
00:24:00.774 --> 00:24:03.510
Juniper. I always have a plan.
Don't you worry.

541
00:24:03.543 --> 00:24:04.744
[straining]

542
00:24:04.778 --> 00:24:05.679
Here.

543
00:24:06.046 --> 00:24:06.913
[cork pops]

544
00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:07.814
I loosened it.

545
00:24:09.015 --> 00:24:10.250
Can I ask you a question?

546
00:24:11.451 --> 00:24:14.120
Why did you give me that
time capsule wish box thingy?

547
00:24:15.555 --> 00:24:18.158
I told you. just found it
cleaning out the basement.

548
00:24:18.191 --> 00:24:19.292
We thought it was cute.

549
00:24:19.325 --> 00:24:20.860
Yeah. Very cute.

550
00:24:20.894 --> 00:24:24.597
So you weren't trying
to send me a message?

551
00:24:24.631 --> 00:24:27.634
What kind of message
would we be sending?

552
00:24:27.667 --> 00:24:29.602
Oh. I don't know.
The 'Are you happy?

553
00:24:29.636 --> 00:24:30.970
Get your life together.

554
00:24:31.004 --> 00:24:33.206
Why aren't you living
your dreams?' kind of message.

555
00:24:33.239 --> 00:24:35.675
No. Uh. no message dear.

556
00:24:35.709 --> 00:24:37.010
Just thought it was cute.

557
00:24:37.043 --> 00:24:37.944
So cute.

558
00:24:39.212 --> 00:24:41.648
Oh. you were such a spitfire
back then.

559
00:24:41.681 --> 00:24:43.650
Do you remember you started
writing that novel

560
00:24:43.683 --> 00:24:45.051
when you were just eight?

561
00:24:45.085 --> 00:24:46.319
Yes. I do.

562
00:24:46.353 --> 00:24:48.688
It is one of the four novels
I have started

563
00:24:48.722 --> 00:24:49.689
and never finished.

564
00:24:49.723 --> 00:24:52.192
-You should wrap those up.
-Yeah. wrap it up!

565
00:24:52.225 --> 00:24:53.993
Oh my gosh you guys. enough!

566
00:24:54.027 --> 00:24:55.161
I know you don't like Ethan.

567
00:24:55.195 --> 00:24:57.230
I know you think I should be
doing something different

568
00:24:57.263 --> 00:24:58.665
with my life.

569
00:24:58.698 --> 00:24:59.899
But you know what. not everybody
gets to choose

570
00:24:59.933 --> 00:25:02.335
what they do for a
living. and not everybody

571
00:25:02.369 --> 00:25:04.237
met their perfect person
in 10th grade

572
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:05.939
like the two of you. so...

573
00:25:06.906 --> 00:25:07.874
[exhales]

574
00:25:09.342 --> 00:25:11.678
-We like Ethan.
-Mm-hmm.

575
00:25:11.711 --> 00:25:15.949
His clothes are always so...
carefully chosen.

576
00:25:15.982 --> 00:25:17.083
Ties especially.

577
00:25:17.117 --> 00:25:20.220
That is hardly a compliment
in the world of you two.

578
00:25:20.253 --> 00:25:21.955
I am going to set the table.

579
00:25:25.392 --> 00:25:27.894
[Junebug] Psst!
Set a place for me.

580
00:25:35.902 --> 00:25:37.937
I used to curl up right
in that spot

581
00:25:37.971 --> 00:25:39.906
when I was pretending
to be sick

582
00:25:39.939 --> 00:25:43.243
because I wanted to stay
home from school to read.

583
00:25:43.276 --> 00:25:45.178
You should tell Mom and Dad
I'm here.

584
00:25:45.211 --> 00:25:46.079
What?

585
00:25:47.414 --> 00:25:49.883
Are you joking? They would
have me sent away.

586
00:25:51.184 --> 00:25:52.986
Anyway. you heard Dad.

587
00:25:53.019 --> 00:25:55.722
It was just something they
found in the basement. Okay?

588
00:25:55.755 --> 00:25:58.258
They didn't mean
anything by it.

589
00:25:58.291 --> 00:26:00.727
I think they're fooling
with you.

590
00:26:01.861 --> 00:26:04.197
You know. I think you
might be right.

591
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:05.899
Dinner's served.

592
00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:08.868
What are you doing in there.
dear?

593
00:26:08.902 --> 00:26:09.903
Nothing.

594
00:26:11.037 --> 00:26:12.038
Let's eat.

595
00:26:28.421 --> 00:26:31.725
Oh. he's just such an
interesting character.

596
00:26:32.692 --> 00:26:35.729
So confident.
It's a little unnerving.

597
00:26:35.762 --> 00:26:36.963
You should be confident too.

598
00:26:36.996 --> 00:26:41.835
Well. it's not that easy. Okay?
You can't just be confident.

599
00:26:41.868 --> 00:26:43.636
It's something that...

600
00:26:44.170 --> 00:26:49.776
grows in you over time as you
acquire life experiences

601
00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:52.712
and you surmount challenges.

602
00:26:52.746 --> 00:26:54.080
But I'm confident.

603
00:26:54.114 --> 00:26:55.248
Well. you are a child.

604
00:26:55.949 --> 00:26:58.118
An imaginary child.
not even a real one.

605
00:26:59.319 --> 00:27:00.920
I think.

606
00:27:01.354 --> 00:27:04.157
Do like Daddy says. Just
pretend you have confidence

607
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:07.093
and then before you know it.
you do have it.

608
00:27:07.127 --> 00:27:08.028
Huh.

609
00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:12.198
I think you might be right.

610
00:27:13.767 --> 00:27:16.136
Okay.
Let's do this.

611
00:27:22.142 --> 00:27:23.376
Uh. hello.

612
00:27:23.410 --> 00:27:25.879
Hi. Not sure if you
remember me.

613
00:27:26.413 --> 00:27:27.914
How could I forget you?

614
00:27:28.782 --> 00:27:30.984
I'm still really. really
sorry about that.

615
00:27:31.017 --> 00:27:33.386
And you really. really need
to stop apologizing.

616
00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:34.821
I wasn't satisfied
with the work

617
00:27:34.854 --> 00:27:36.189
and you gave me
the second chance

618
00:27:36.222 --> 00:27:37.390
to take a second
run at it.

619
00:27:37.424 --> 00:27:39.759
Okay. then I will stop
apologizing.

620
00:27:40.527 --> 00:27:42.495
I'm Juniper. Juniper James.

621
00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:44.497
Yeah. I remember.

622
00:27:44.531 --> 00:27:45.899
Oh. Right.

623
00:27:46.499 --> 00:27:47.767
And you are?

624
00:27:48.301 --> 00:27:49.903
Not a fan of this weather.

625
00:27:51.171 --> 00:27:52.238
Yeah.

626
00:27:52.272 --> 00:27:53.873
Makes it impossible to paint.

627
00:27:54.274 --> 00:27:56.843
Well look. I know I already
talked to you about this.

628
00:27:56.876 --> 00:28:00.814
but I would really like you
to consider trying a new way

629
00:28:00.847 --> 00:28:02.415
to get your art out there.

630
00:28:02.449 --> 00:28:03.817
Oh. I don't know.

631
00:28:05.018 --> 00:28:08.822
I like murals.
I like to beautify the world.

632
00:28:09.422 --> 00:28:12.092
Do you... sign them?

633
00:28:13.226 --> 00:28:14.761
I leave them unsigned

634
00:28:14.794 --> 00:28:17.063
because when people
learn who did them. they...

635
00:28:18.064 --> 00:28:20.433
start adding your story
onto what you did.

636
00:28:20.467 --> 00:28:22.068
And is that bad?

637
00:28:22.102 --> 00:28:24.771
It is when they care more
about your story than the work.

638
00:28:24.804 --> 00:28:27.974
Well... that wouldn't be true
with a picture book.

639
00:28:28.008 --> 00:28:29.776
The children wouldn't care.

640
00:28:29.809 --> 00:28:32.012
I like books.
I do. but...

641
00:28:32.912 --> 00:28:34.347
I'm gonna stick with murals.

642
00:28:36.016 --> 00:28:38.785
Okay. Yeah.
Um. no problem.

643
00:28:38.818 --> 00:28:40.453
Thanks. Thanks so much
for your time.

644
00:28:40.487 --> 00:28:41.821
Yeah.

645
00:28:47.494 --> 00:28:49.129
Why are you leaving him there?

646
00:28:49.162 --> 00:28:51.297
You have to get him
to come with you.

647
00:28:51.331 --> 00:28:52.332
You're so bossy.

648
00:28:53.266 --> 00:28:55.869
Look. you heard him.
He's not interested.

649
00:28:55.902 --> 00:28:57.470
And I asked him twice.

650
00:28:57.504 --> 00:28:59.973
Listen to the voice inside
that tells you

651
00:29:00.006 --> 00:29:01.441
when things are important.

652
00:29:01.474 --> 00:29:03.109
Well. I thought
that was you.

653
00:29:03.143 --> 00:29:04.344
So listen!

654
00:29:04.377 --> 00:29:06.046
Okay. I'll try one last thing.

655
00:29:08.081 --> 00:29:09.516
Okay. Sorry to disturb again.

656
00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:12.485
But I just need to say that
children's books are sacred.

657
00:29:12.519 --> 00:29:14.954
They are the bedrock
of our imagination.

658
00:29:14.988 --> 00:29:16.856
They're where I first
came alive as a kid.

659
00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:19.025
where I first found humor
and adventure

660
00:29:19.059 --> 00:29:21.394
and sheer joy and
they make us who we are

661
00:29:21.428 --> 00:29:24.431
and who we're going to become
and they are important.

662
00:29:26.266 --> 00:29:29.135
So... I think you're making
a mistake.

663
00:29:31.338 --> 00:29:33.006
Bedrock of imagination. huh?

664
00:29:34.908 --> 00:29:36.009
I like that.

665
00:29:36.042 --> 00:29:36.910
You do?

666
00:29:37.410 --> 00:29:38.511
Oh. Um...

667
00:29:39.145 --> 00:29:41.281
Then give me an hour.
Just one hour and...

668
00:29:41.314 --> 00:29:43.416
and then if you're still
not interested

669
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:45.185
then I'll leave you be.

670
00:29:45.218 --> 00:29:46.052
One hour.

671
00:29:46.486 --> 00:29:47.354
One hour.

672
00:29:48.355 --> 00:29:49.255
Okay. fine.

673
00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:52.258
Because this light is
breaking my heart.

674
00:29:53.460 --> 00:29:54.894
Here. Gimme a hand.

675
00:30:06.006 --> 00:30:09.109
[cheerful music]

676
00:30:12.612 --> 00:30:17.283
Okay. so... we have some books
that Little Light has published

677
00:30:17.317 --> 00:30:22.922
and some classics
and a Caldecott Award winner.

678
00:30:23.523 --> 00:30:24.557
What about you?

679
00:30:24.591 --> 00:30:25.892
What do you mean?

680
00:30:25.925 --> 00:30:27.427
I don't wanna see
the award winners.

681
00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:29.963
I want the book that means
something to you.

682
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:31.464
Only you.

683
00:30:34.634 --> 00:30:36.670
Okay. Stay right here.
Don't move.

684
00:30:36.703 --> 00:30:38.104
I'll be back.

685
00:30:48.381 --> 00:30:52.318
[upbeat cheerful music]

686
00:30:55.422 --> 00:30:57.190
[whispers] Thank you.

687
00:30:57.223 --> 00:30:58.324
[giggles]

688
00:31:00.226 --> 00:31:02.395
-The Princess Werewolf.
-Mm-hmm.

689
00:31:02.429 --> 00:31:03.263
Wow.

690
00:31:05.065 --> 00:31:07.334
So this was your favorite
book growing up?

691
00:31:07.367 --> 00:31:09.302
My absolute favorite.

692
00:31:09.336 --> 00:31:11.304
What did you love most
about it?

693
00:31:11.338 --> 00:31:14.407
I think how the princess works
together with the knight

694
00:31:14.441 --> 00:31:16.042
to reclaim the kingdom.

695
00:31:17.644 --> 00:31:19.346
It was just very inspiring.

696
00:31:19.379 --> 00:31:22.148
I mean. every eight-year-old
wishes she could rule

697
00:31:22.182 --> 00:31:24.384
benevolently over her own
kingdom. Right?

698
00:31:27.187 --> 00:31:28.655
I can see why you loved it.

699
00:31:29.255 --> 00:31:33.059
But your face right now.
looking at the images.

700
00:31:33.093 --> 00:31:36.129
that is why you should share
your work in picture books.

701
00:31:37.197 --> 00:31:40.400
Just think of all the little
kids reading your book.

702
00:31:41.234 --> 00:31:43.636
Their faces lighting up
the way yours just did.

703
00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:46.673
Are you implying I have the
mentality of an eight-year-old?

704
00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:49.676
Look. at the very least.
you could take a meeting

705
00:31:49.709 --> 00:31:51.745
and then decide. Right?

706
00:31:51.778 --> 00:31:53.313
What do you have to lose?

707
00:31:54.014 --> 00:31:55.382
Okay. well...

708
00:31:56.416 --> 00:31:59.052
We're gonna need your
library card to take it out

709
00:31:59.085 --> 00:32:00.420
because I don't have one.

710
00:32:00.453 --> 00:32:01.588
All set.

711
00:32:08.561 --> 00:32:09.629
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

712
00:32:11.364 --> 00:32:12.032
There you go.

713
00:32:12.065 --> 00:32:14.034
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

714
00:32:14.067 --> 00:32:16.369
So you said this book inspired
you back there.

715
00:32:16.403 --> 00:32:18.571
Is that what got you
into publishing?

716
00:32:18.605 --> 00:32:21.141
Yes. Well. kind of.

717
00:32:21.174 --> 00:32:23.710
When I was a little kid.
I wanted to be a writer.

718
00:32:23.743 --> 00:32:26.112
I mean. what book-smart
little girl doesn't.

719
00:32:26.146 --> 00:32:28.081
but publishing.
that came later.

720
00:32:29.049 --> 00:32:31.618
All I heard is little Juniper
wanted to be a writer.

721
00:32:32.552 --> 00:32:33.520
Junebug.

722
00:32:35.088 --> 00:32:37.724
And yeah. I think most
little kids think they know

723
00:32:37.757 --> 00:32:39.426
what their life
is gonna be like

724
00:32:39.459 --> 00:32:41.661
but it doesn't always
work out that way.

725
00:32:41.695 --> 00:32:45.031
That's why we have professions
other than astronaut.

726
00:32:45.065 --> 00:32:47.167
movie star and firefighter.
Right?

727
00:32:48.168 --> 00:32:50.437
Maybe that eight-year-old
knew something.

728
00:32:50.470 --> 00:32:53.740
Well. she certainly
is headstrong... was.

729
00:32:53.773 --> 00:32:55.342
Was headstrong.

730
00:32:56.176 --> 00:32:58.111
You should tell me some
of her ideas.

731
00:32:58.144 --> 00:32:59.212
I'd love to hear 'em.

732
00:32:59.245 --> 00:33:01.047
No. they're nonsense.

733
00:33:01.081 --> 00:33:03.283
You know. mostly the ideas
of an eight-year-old.

734
00:33:03.316 --> 00:33:06.119
Isn't that who we're talking
about making a book for?

735
00:33:06.152 --> 00:33:07.554
Eight-year-olds?

736
00:33:07.587 --> 00:33:08.355
Are we?

737
00:33:09.222 --> 00:33:11.291
Are we talking about
making a book?

738
00:33:12.225 --> 00:33:14.527
I tell you what. you tell
me some of those ideas

739
00:33:14.561 --> 00:33:16.696
and I'll consider taking
the meeting.

740
00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.498
No. I can't even
remember them.

741
00:33:18.531 --> 00:33:20.066
Oh. I don't believe you.

742
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.068
Because I can see
your eyes light up

743
00:33:22.102 --> 00:33:24.137
every time you talk
about writing.

744
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:25.605
I see the passion.

745
00:33:25.638 --> 00:33:26.806
Okay. That's cute.

746
00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.209
You're using my technique
back on me.

747
00:33:30.276 --> 00:33:32.479
Because we see the same things.

748
00:33:35.582 --> 00:33:37.784
I don't even know your name.

749
00:33:37.817 --> 00:33:39.386
Alex.

750
00:33:39.753 --> 00:33:41.154
Alex Ripley.

751
00:33:42.589 --> 00:33:43.423
Hi.

752
00:33:45.458 --> 00:33:49.329
Anyway. Um. so...
do we have a deal?

753
00:33:50.397 --> 00:33:52.699
Sure. Yes. I will try
to remember my ideas.

754
00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.268
Okay.

755
00:33:55.802 --> 00:33:58.238
Here. let me give you
my number.

756
00:33:59.639 --> 00:34:02.542
Okay. Just gimme a call...

757
00:34:03.810 --> 00:34:05.445
when you're ready to talk.

758
00:34:05.478 --> 00:34:06.413
Thanks.

759
00:34:07.147 --> 00:34:07.881
There you go.

760
00:34:07.914 --> 00:34:09.249
Thank you.

761
00:34:09.282 --> 00:34:11.384
Oh. wait.
I think this one's yours.

762
00:34:11.418 --> 00:34:13.753
Yeah. Okay. Definitely.
There you go.

763
00:34:15.188 --> 00:34:16.623
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

764
00:34:21.194 --> 00:34:22.529
You coming?

765
00:34:24.664 --> 00:34:25.465
Yeah.

766
00:34:32.772 --> 00:34:36.343
[peaceful music]

767
00:35:02.702 --> 00:35:04.671
You found my stories.

768
00:35:06.706 --> 00:35:07.774
I did.

769
00:35:12.712 --> 00:35:13.580
[chuckles]

770
00:35:14.347 --> 00:35:16.216
Not bad for an eight-year-old.

771
00:35:17.884 --> 00:35:20.253
Not bad for yourself.

772
00:35:29.362 --> 00:35:32.365
[phone alarm beeping]

773
00:35:33.333 --> 00:35:36.302
I hate waking up so early.

774
00:35:38.972 --> 00:35:39.873
Me too.

775
00:35:41.274 --> 00:35:43.576
[phone alarm continues to beep]

776
00:35:46.946 --> 00:35:48.581
[phone buzzing]

777
00:35:49.816 --> 00:35:51.584
Pasta night again?

778
00:35:52.585 --> 00:35:54.454
Yeah. Pasta nights are great.

779
00:35:54.487 --> 00:35:57.290
Once a week. Ethan and I
indulge ourselves

780
00:35:57.323 --> 00:36:00.593
with a nice pasta dinner
that we make together.

781
00:36:05.465 --> 00:36:07.334
[sighs]

782
00:36:07.367 --> 00:36:09.803
Why do you make the
same dinner every week?

783
00:36:10.704 --> 00:36:13.773
I don't know.
'cause it's easier.

784
00:36:13.807 --> 00:36:14.674
[spits]

785
00:36:16.576 --> 00:36:18.278
Boring.

786
00:36:18.311 --> 00:36:20.613
It's not boring.
It's fun.

787
00:36:23.483 --> 00:36:27.554
How is it fun to do the same
thing over and over again?

788
00:36:27.587 --> 00:36:31.358
Remember how Mommy used to say.
no such thing as being bored.

789
00:36:31.391 --> 00:36:32.525
just being boring?

790
00:36:32.559 --> 00:36:35.295
Please don't quote Mom
back at me.

791
00:36:35.328 --> 00:36:38.631
And anyway.
Ethan is not boring.

792
00:36:38.665 --> 00:36:40.000
He is stable.

793
00:36:40.633 --> 00:36:43.403
That's what he is.
He's extremely stable.

794
00:36:46.373 --> 00:36:48.808
We are not boring.
I'll prove it.

795
00:36:48.842 --> 00:36:49.976
[dialing]

796
00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:51.044
Hi.

797
00:36:51.077 --> 00:36:52.912
[Ethan] Hey you.
Everything okay?

798
00:36:52.946 --> 00:36:54.347
Yeah.

799
00:36:54.381 --> 00:36:57.751
I was just. um... thinking
maybe we could

800
00:36:57.784 --> 00:37:00.854
try something different
for dinner tonight.

801
00:37:00.887 --> 00:37:02.722
Oh. Not pasta then?

802
00:37:02.756 --> 00:37:05.458
No. no. no. We could still
have pasta. but...

803
00:37:05.492 --> 00:37:07.894
what about a different
type of pasta?

804
00:37:07.927 --> 00:37:09.596
Isn't all pasta sorta the same?

805
00:37:09.629 --> 00:37:10.663
Uh...

806
00:37:10.697 --> 00:37:12.966
I just wanna try
something different.

807
00:37:13.633 --> 00:37:16.002
For sure.
What kind would you like?

808
00:37:16.036 --> 00:37:18.505
I don't know. Surprise me.
Okay. gotta go.

809
00:37:22.876 --> 00:37:23.910
Not one word.

810
00:37:36.923 --> 00:37:39.726
I know you said you wanted
to try something new.

811
00:37:39.759 --> 00:37:43.029
Honestly babe. I looked at the
different boxes and I thought...

812
00:37:43.063 --> 00:37:44.931
if it ain't broke. why fix it?

813
00:37:44.964 --> 00:37:47.701
So I just got us penne.
as usual.

814
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:50.570
I can. uh...

815
00:37:50.603 --> 00:37:52.772
I can go back and get
something else?

816
00:37:52.806 --> 00:37:54.874
No. It's fine.

817
00:37:55.675 --> 00:37:56.810
What's all this?

818
00:37:56.843 --> 00:37:57.811
Dessert.

819
00:37:59.112 --> 00:38:02.048
I got a... amaretti
and sultana cheesecake

820
00:38:02.082 --> 00:38:04.951
and. um... I got some ice cream.

821
00:38:05.819 --> 00:38:07.854
Raspberry swirl for fun.

822
00:38:07.887 --> 00:38:09.089
Is everything okay?

823
00:38:09.122 --> 00:38:11.891
Did. uh... something
happen at work today?

824
00:38:12.592 --> 00:38:14.361
You didn't get fired.
did you?

825
00:38:14.761 --> 00:38:17.530
What? Why would you think
I got fired?

826
00:38:17.564 --> 00:38:20.033
I don't know. you've just been
acting odd lately.

827
00:38:21.701 --> 00:38:22.502
[sighs]

828
00:38:24.637 --> 00:38:27.574
Ethan. I think we need
to go sit down.

829
00:38:30.176 --> 00:38:34.581
Ethan... what do you see
in the future for us?

830
00:38:34.614 --> 00:38:36.850
-The future?
-Mm-hmm.

831
00:38:36.883 --> 00:38:37.951
I don't know.

832
00:38:37.984 --> 00:38:40.520
I hadn't really given it much
thought. truthfully.

833
00:38:40.553 --> 00:38:41.988
I like our little routines.

834
00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:46.426
I don't understand where
this is coming from.

835
00:38:46.459 --> 00:38:48.561
Okay. look. If you could
spend time

836
00:38:48.595 --> 00:38:52.399
with your eight-year-old self.
do you think he would be happy

837
00:38:52.432 --> 00:38:53.700
with where you are today?

838
00:38:53.733 --> 00:38:55.769
When I was eight. I wanted
to be a pilot

839
00:38:55.802 --> 00:38:58.104
and travel the world. so...
probably not.

840
00:38:58.138 --> 00:39:00.473
I think you would've made
a great pilot

841
00:39:00.507 --> 00:39:03.510
and you should...
you should travel the world.

842
00:39:03.543 --> 00:39:04.978
That's kid stuff.

843
00:39:05.011 --> 00:39:08.481
I didn't know about real life
when I was eight years old.

844
00:39:08.515 --> 00:39:11.518
I think you might've known
a lot more than you think.

845
00:39:12.952 --> 00:39:14.754
And maybe I did too.

846
00:39:15.822 --> 00:39:16.890
All I know...

847
00:39:18.525 --> 00:39:20.560
is that I don't wanna
end up with a bunch of regrets.

848
00:39:21.161 --> 00:39:24.764
And you're saying being with me
might be one of those regrets.

849
00:39:25.932 --> 00:39:27.600
Sorry. Ethan.

850
00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:33.707
[melancholy music]

851
00:39:38.912 --> 00:39:39.779
[sighs]

852
00:39:45.785 --> 00:39:46.619
Are you sad?

853
00:39:46.653 --> 00:39:49.756
I don't know.
I'm a little stunned.

854
00:39:49.789 --> 00:39:52.826
Three years.
It's a long time.

855
00:39:54.227 --> 00:39:56.896
We had a nice thing
going sometimes.

856
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:58.498
I don't know.

857
00:39:58.531 --> 00:40:00.700
Just felt like the right
thing to do.

858
00:40:00.734 --> 00:40:02.769
You know I'm just a kid. right?

859
00:40:02.802 --> 00:40:04.904
I don't understand
any of this stuff.

860
00:40:06.172 --> 00:40:07.474
Junebug...

861
00:40:07.907 --> 00:40:10.043
You don't seem like
a kid sometimes.

862
00:40:10.076 --> 00:40:13.513
Mommy always says we're like
eight going on 30.

863
00:40:13.546 --> 00:40:15.915
Yes. well we're past 30 now.

864
00:40:15.949 --> 00:40:17.183
[laughs]

865
00:40:17.217 --> 00:40:19.085
Oh. you think that's funny.
Do you?

866
00:40:19.119 --> 00:40:20.954
[both laughing]

867
00:40:24.657 --> 00:40:26.659
[knock at door]
-Juniper!

868
00:40:26.693 --> 00:40:28.762
[doorbell ringing]
-You home?

869
00:40:32.899 --> 00:40:35.068
It's Saturday and you're
sleeping in?

870
00:40:35.101 --> 00:40:36.636
What gives?

871
00:40:36.670 --> 00:40:39.105
Hmm. I thought I was doing
a pretty good job of it.

872
00:40:39.139 --> 00:40:39.939
Is everything okay?

873
00:40:39.973 --> 00:40:42.275
You haven't answered
any of my texts.

874
00:40:42.308 --> 00:40:44.044
Ethan and I broke up
last night.

875
00:40:44.077 --> 00:40:44.978
Really?

876
00:40:45.845 --> 00:40:46.513
Was it the pen?

877
00:40:46.546 --> 00:40:48.114
It was kinda
the pen. yeah.

878
00:40:48.782 --> 00:40:52.052
No. I just think it was...
time.

879
00:40:52.652 --> 00:40:53.953
Wait a second.

880
00:40:53.987 --> 00:40:56.990
You've met somebody.
I can see it from your eyes.

881
00:40:57.023 --> 00:40:58.091
No. I...

882
00:40:58.792 --> 00:41:00.727
I mean. I met this
new illustrator

883
00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.162
I'm really excited about.

884
00:41:02.195 --> 00:41:03.530
if that's what you mean.

885
00:41:03.563 --> 00:41:04.898
Yeah. you like his work.

886
00:41:04.931 --> 00:41:08.001
Really excited about his
illustrations. I'm sure.

887
00:41:08.668 --> 00:41:10.637
I'm sorry you ended things
with Ethan.

888
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:11.971
That must've been hard.

889
00:41:12.005 --> 00:41:13.073
Yeah. it was.

890
00:41:15.709 --> 00:41:17.777
Thank you for being there
for me

891
00:41:17.811 --> 00:41:20.013
and for basically
my entire life.

892
00:41:20.046 --> 00:41:21.681
[laughs]

893
00:41:22.882 --> 00:41:24.184
Katydid.

894
00:41:24.217 --> 00:41:25.218
Katydid.

895
00:41:25.852 --> 00:41:28.288
Oh. I can't believe you
remember that.

896
00:41:28.321 --> 00:41:30.156
You hated our little
kid nicknames

897
00:41:30.190 --> 00:41:32.025
once we got to high school.

898
00:41:32.058 --> 00:41:35.628
Well yeah. because who wants
to be nicknamed after bugs?

899
00:41:35.662 --> 00:41:37.864
You're the one
who made them up.

900
00:41:37.897 --> 00:41:40.800
Remember. you wrote that
little story about us as bugs?

901
00:41:40.834 --> 00:41:42.736
Junebug and Katydid Forever.

902
00:41:42.769 --> 00:41:44.871
Oh. I can't believe
you'd forget that.

903
00:41:44.904 --> 00:41:45.772
Forever.

904
00:41:45.805 --> 00:41:46.940
Forever.

905
00:41:48.842 --> 00:41:50.744
* Ooh *

906
00:41:51.277 --> 00:41:52.946
* I found you *

907
00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:57.183
* I feel like I'm
finally home *

908
00:42:02.155 --> 00:42:03.790
Do you want another espresso?

909
00:42:03.823 --> 00:42:06.593
You might need it to finish
all that work you got there.

910
00:42:06.626 --> 00:42:08.762
Oh. uh... sure.

911
00:42:08.795 --> 00:42:10.764
No. that's probably
not a good idea.

912
00:42:10.797 --> 00:42:12.232
I never heard from you.

913
00:42:12.265 --> 00:42:13.933
Oh. hi.

914
00:42:13.967 --> 00:42:14.834
Hi.

915
00:42:16.369 --> 00:42:18.872
I'm glad you're here.
I need you.

916
00:42:19.372 --> 00:42:20.740
You do?

917
00:42:20.774 --> 00:42:22.042
Yeah. Come on.

918
00:42:23.109 --> 00:42:25.245
-Micah. watch my table?
-Yeah. I got it.

919
00:42:26.813 --> 00:42:28.748
Time for some penance.

920
00:42:28.782 --> 00:42:30.617
No. no. no. no. no.

921
00:42:30.650 --> 00:42:32.752
Oh yeah.
It's happening.

922
00:42:32.786 --> 00:42:34.054
Besides. you owe me.

923
00:42:34.721 --> 00:42:36.222
-I kind of do.
-Yeah.

924
00:42:36.256 --> 00:42:37.991
Have a seat.

925
00:42:38.024 --> 00:42:38.658
Alright.

926
00:42:38.692 --> 00:42:40.160
What if I mess it up again?

927
00:42:40.193 --> 00:42:42.328
You won't mess it up.
Do the background.

928
00:42:42.362 --> 00:42:44.064
I'll handle the detail work.

929
00:42:44.097 --> 00:42:46.800
We're using acrylics.
but you have to move fast.

930
00:42:46.833 --> 00:42:48.968
This is what painters call
open time

931
00:42:49.002 --> 00:42:52.672
because paints are still wet.
you can still mix them.

932
00:42:52.706 --> 00:42:55.308
Open time.
Alright. I kinda of like that.

933
00:42:57.043 --> 00:43:00.914
[peaceful music]

934
00:43:02.115 --> 00:43:03.283
[chuckles]

935
00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:05.752
This is pretty fun.

936
00:43:06.986 --> 00:43:09.689
I haven't really done anything
like this since I was a kid.

937
00:43:09.723 --> 00:43:11.424
A huge part of creativity
is connecting

938
00:43:11.458 --> 00:43:12.892
with that kid part
of yourself.

939
00:43:12.926 --> 00:43:16.029
Can I ask you something?
Why are you here?

940
00:43:16.062 --> 00:43:16.963
What do you mean?

941
00:43:16.996 --> 00:43:20.900
Well. you achieved
unprecedented success.

942
00:43:20.934 --> 00:43:22.402
I've done my homework on you.

943
00:43:22.435 --> 00:43:23.937
I don't see it that way.

944
00:43:23.970 --> 00:43:27.107
What I mean is you could be
in Barcelona or Lucerne

945
00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:30.310
or Kyoto and you're
right here in Seattle.

946
00:43:31.111 --> 00:43:32.245
Why?

947
00:43:32.278 --> 00:43:33.146
Easy.

948
00:43:34.914 --> 00:43:37.050
I grew up not far from here.
Part of keeping the work fresh

949
00:43:37.083 --> 00:43:40.387
is reconnecting with where you
came from. what your story is.

950
00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.056
Yeah. I think that could be
my problem.

951
00:43:43.089 --> 00:43:45.925
Sort of lost who I was
the last few years.

952
00:43:45.959 --> 00:43:48.194
It's one of my biggest
regrets right now.

953
00:43:48.228 --> 00:43:49.863
I don't believe in regrets.

954
00:43:49.896 --> 00:43:51.831
But... if I had any.

955
00:43:51.865 --> 00:43:53.800
it would be not finishing
what I started.

956
00:43:53.833 --> 00:43:55.301
I can relate to that.

957
00:43:55.335 --> 00:43:58.838
I started writing so many times
and it's always the same.

958
00:43:58.872 --> 00:44:01.408
I get spooked and never finish.

959
00:44:01.441 --> 00:44:03.076
Doesn't sound worthy
of regret.

960
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:05.145
it just sounds worthy
of finishing.

961
00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.415
What about your story idea?

962
00:44:08.448 --> 00:44:12.819
I've got notions and ideas.
but nothing solid really.

963
00:44:12.852 --> 00:44:15.055
Well. we have a deal.

964
00:44:15.088 --> 00:44:16.189
No story...

965
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:18.158
no meeting.

966
00:44:18.191 --> 00:44:20.927
But I can team you with
so many amazing writers.

967
00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.363
I've already found who
I wanna collaborate with.

968
00:44:37.043 --> 00:44:39.279
Actually. I think I do
have an idea.

969
00:44:39.312 --> 00:44:40.980
Okay.

970
00:44:41.014 --> 00:44:43.950
You have my number. so text me
some times for a meeting.

971
00:44:43.983 --> 00:44:44.517
Okay.

972
00:44:44.551 --> 00:44:45.852
For real this time.

973
00:44:45.885 --> 00:44:46.920
You got it.

974
00:44:47.987 --> 00:44:51.224
Alright. I should get back
so I can get my stuff.

975
00:44:51.257 --> 00:44:52.492
Yeah. Thanks for the help.

976
00:44:52.525 --> 00:44:53.393
Yeah.

977
00:44:59.966 --> 00:45:03.269
[singing] Alex and Juniper
sittin' in a tree.

978
00:45:03.303 --> 00:45:05.939
-K-I-S-S-I-N-G.
-Okay.

979
00:45:05.972 --> 00:45:06.840
Shh!

980
00:45:06.873 --> 00:45:08.975
Well. at least now you know
his name.

981
00:45:09.009 --> 00:45:11.845
First comes love.
then comes marriage.

982
00:45:28.862 --> 00:45:29.562
[exhales]

983
00:45:29.596 --> 00:45:31.164
You're unhappy.

984
00:45:31.197 --> 00:45:34.000
I just don't know what
I'm gonna tell Alex tomorrow.

985
00:45:34.034 --> 00:45:37.170
He expects me to have a story
to pitch and...

986
00:45:37.203 --> 00:45:38.972
I just don't wanna
let him down.

987
00:45:39.005 --> 00:45:41.274
You won't.
He likes you.

988
00:45:41.908 --> 00:45:43.510
You need to get some sleep.

989
00:45:43.543 --> 00:45:46.212
Yeah. We're up way past
our bedtimes.

990
00:45:46.246 --> 00:45:47.480
Yes. we are.

991
00:45:53.086 --> 00:45:54.254
Whoa!

992
00:45:54.287 --> 00:45:55.088
You cleaned up.

993
00:45:55.121 --> 00:45:56.990
Feels like the first
day of school.

994
00:45:57.023 --> 00:45:58.558
I hated the
first day of school.

995
00:45:58.591 --> 00:46:00.960
Well. it won't be
that bad... I hope.

996
00:46:01.628 --> 00:46:03.096
I've got a mural to paint.

997
00:46:03.129 --> 00:46:04.564
Wait. Don't you dare.

998
00:46:04.597 --> 00:46:07.000
No. We're in this together.

999
00:46:08.635 --> 00:46:09.536
So...

1000
00:46:11.271 --> 00:46:13.907
Think of this as talking to
someone who admires your work.

1001
00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:15.909
If Paula came by and saw
the mural.

1002
00:46:15.942 --> 00:46:18.445
you would just
talk to her. Right?

1003
00:46:18.478 --> 00:46:20.480
-Okay. Alright. fine.
-Yeah.

1004
00:46:20.513 --> 00:46:21.414
What's that?

1005
00:46:21.948 --> 00:46:24.484
Um... nothing.

1006
00:46:24.517 --> 00:46:25.585
Ready to go in?

1007
00:46:25.618 --> 00:46:26.586
Uh. wait. Hold on.

1008
00:46:26.619 --> 00:46:29.189
What's our story here?
What are we telling her?

1009
00:46:29.222 --> 00:46:31.424
Okay. so I wanted to talk
to you about that.

1010
00:46:31.458 --> 00:46:35.128
Um... I am really struggling
with the writing.

1011
00:46:35.161 --> 00:46:37.630
so we need to go in there
and ask Paula

1012
00:46:37.664 --> 00:46:39.332
to pair you with
a real writer.

1013
00:46:39.366 --> 00:46:42.068
I'll still be your editor.
so we will have a very

1014
00:46:42.102 --> 00:46:43.236
creative relationship.

1015
00:46:43.269 --> 00:46:45.271
but this is really
the best decision.

1016
00:46:45.305 --> 00:46:46.973
-No.
-What?

1017
00:46:47.007 --> 00:46:49.142
No. Didn't you just say
we're in this together?

1018
00:46:49.175 --> 00:46:51.044
You're the writer.
I'm the artist.

1019
00:46:51.077 --> 00:46:53.046
and that's what
we tell your boss.

1020
00:46:53.079 --> 00:46:55.181
-Come on.
- But. Alex...

1021
00:46:55.215 --> 00:46:56.282
Alex...

1022
00:46:58.651 --> 00:47:00.220
It's very impressive.

1023
00:47:00.253 --> 00:47:02.922
You have a distinctive style.
which we're always

1024
00:47:02.956 --> 00:47:05.091
on the lookout for
in new illustrators.

1025
00:47:05.125 --> 00:47:06.659
It's a great portfolio.

1026
00:47:06.693 --> 00:47:09.396
Yeah. I. uh. didn't compile it.

1027
00:47:09.429 --> 00:47:10.630
What do you mean?

1028
00:47:10.663 --> 00:47:12.999
Well. I put it together. Paula.

1029
00:47:13.466 --> 00:47:16.136
There are pictures of his work
all over the internet

1030
00:47:16.169 --> 00:47:18.271
and people really love it.

1031
00:47:19.406 --> 00:47:20.306
That's funny.

1032
00:47:21.241 --> 00:47:23.209
I've always resisted
having a portfolio.

1033
00:47:23.243 --> 00:47:25.512
You'll make a a great addition
to our team.

1034
00:47:26.279 --> 00:47:28.114
Okay? Yeah.

1035
00:47:28.148 --> 00:47:32.652
So the next stage is to find
an author to team you up with.

1036
00:47:32.686 --> 00:47:35.255
Which. uh. Little Light
is small.

1037
00:47:35.288 --> 00:47:38.091
but we are a highly thought
of children's book publisher

1038
00:47:38.124 --> 00:47:39.592
so I'm sure it won't be
a problem.

1039
00:47:39.626 --> 00:47:42.295
Oh. well. I've already found
who I wanna work with.

1040
00:47:42.328 --> 00:47:44.564
You have?
Is it someone I'd know?

1041
00:47:45.465 --> 00:47:46.499
[chuckles nervously]

1042
00:47:47.434 --> 00:47:49.135
It's me. Paula.

1043
00:47:50.437 --> 00:47:51.571
I'm sorry?

1044
00:47:51.604 --> 00:47:54.040
I'm going to be writing
the text.

1045
00:47:55.041 --> 00:47:57.510
I wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for Juniper.

1046
00:47:57.544 --> 00:48:00.280
She has a real passion
for children's literature

1047
00:48:00.313 --> 00:48:03.016
and a great idea for a book
I think you'd find exciting.

1048
00:48:03.049 --> 00:48:04.918
Great. Hit me.

1049
00:48:05.418 --> 00:48:09.289
Well. we're not exactly
ready to present it yet.

1050
00:48:09.322 --> 00:48:11.591
But she told me many great
things about you

1051
00:48:11.624 --> 00:48:13.293
so I really wanted to meet.

1052
00:48:13.326 --> 00:48:14.327
I see.

1053
00:48:14.361 --> 00:48:16.563
And it's very nice Juniper
said those things.

1054
00:48:16.596 --> 00:48:18.565
She's a very talented editor.

1055
00:48:18.598 --> 00:48:22.135
But writing a book is a
whole other kettle of fish.

1056
00:48:22.168 --> 00:48:24.738
so I'm gonna have to give
this some more thought.

1057
00:48:24.771 --> 00:48:26.740
It's the first time
an employee's ever

1058
00:48:26.773 --> 00:48:28.608
presented themselves to me
as an author.

1059
00:48:28.641 --> 00:48:29.943
[notification alert]
-Um...

1060
00:48:30.543 --> 00:48:33.046
Yes. I have a new fire
to deal with here.

1061
00:48:33.079 --> 00:48:34.614
so Alex. you're
very talented.

1062
00:48:34.647 --> 00:48:36.249
and Juniper. you
just let me know

1063
00:48:36.282 --> 00:48:39.452
when you are ready to
take it to the next stage.

1064
00:48:39.486 --> 00:48:40.553
Okay. great.

1065
00:48:41.421 --> 00:48:42.022
Well. off you go.

1066
00:48:42.055 --> 00:48:43.723
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay.

1067
00:48:43.757 --> 00:48:45.091
Thank you.

1068
00:48:45.125 --> 00:48:47.127
-Get the door.
-Of course. yes. Always.

1069
00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:48.328
-Got you.
-Okay.

1070
00:48:48.361 --> 00:48:49.396
I got you.

1071
00:48:50.130 --> 00:48:51.164
Thank you.

1072
00:48:52.532 --> 00:48:53.733
I thought it went well.

1073
00:48:53.767 --> 00:48:55.602
I liked her more
than I expected to.

1074
00:48:55.635 --> 00:48:58.571
Don't you understand?
She expects something soon.

1075
00:48:58.605 --> 00:49:00.507
Like soon. soon.

1076
00:49:01.274 --> 00:49:02.609
I'm not ready as a writer.

1077
00:49:02.642 --> 00:49:04.477
I am not ready
as a human being.

1078
00:49:04.511 --> 00:49:06.479
Breathe. Breathe.
It's gonna be okay.

1079
00:49:06.513 --> 00:49:07.380
Okay.

1080
00:49:08.081 --> 00:49:09.282
Thank you.

1081
00:49:09.315 --> 00:49:11.217
What's the worst
that could happen?

1082
00:49:11.251 --> 00:49:14.421
Well. Paula will resent that
I put myself forward as writer.

1083
00:49:14.454 --> 00:49:16.556
Our entire relationship
will be soured.

1084
00:49:16.589 --> 00:49:19.459
Eventually she'll start to
question all of my work.

1085
00:49:19.492 --> 00:49:22.295
Before I know it. she'll
fire me and I won't be able

1086
00:49:22.328 --> 00:49:24.497
to pay my rent.
Then I'll have to move in

1087
00:49:24.531 --> 00:49:27.767
with my parents and when I'm
living in my parents' basement..

1088
00:49:27.801 --> 00:49:30.236
Okay. Okay.
I get it. I get it.

1089
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:33.273
And you've proven you have
a very crazy imagination.

1090
00:49:33.306 --> 00:49:33.873
I do.

1091
00:49:33.907 --> 00:49:35.342
Watch out.
Watch out.

1092
00:49:36.409 --> 00:49:37.310
Whoa.

1093
00:49:38.745 --> 00:49:40.113
Jeez.

1094
00:49:40.146 --> 00:49:42.148
Okay. that was a total
Lloyd Dobler move.

1095
00:49:43.116 --> 00:49:45.385
I gave up my boombox
and Peter Gabriel tapes

1096
00:49:45.418 --> 00:49:46.186
a long time ago.

1097
00:49:46.219 --> 00:49:48.621
Stop it. You know
"Say Anything".

1098
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:53.326
Of course. Yeah. It's...
Yeah. it's a classic.

1099
00:49:58.565 --> 00:50:00.667
Anyway. I have a commission
to finish.

1100
00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:02.202
I gotta get back.

1101
00:50:06.373 --> 00:50:09.275
So... where should we start?

1102
00:50:09.309 --> 00:50:11.811
Let's start tonight at 8:00
at the café.

1103
00:50:11.845 --> 00:50:13.413
We'll go over some stuff.

1104
00:50:13.446 --> 00:50:14.381
Okay.

1105
00:50:17.517 --> 00:50:19.419
-Anyway. see you tonight.
-Yeah.

1106
00:50:19.452 --> 00:50:20.353
Um...

1107
00:50:20.387 --> 00:50:21.654
-This... yeah.
-That way.

1108
00:50:22.522 --> 00:50:23.390
Ooh!

1109
00:50:27.594 --> 00:50:28.461
Hi Mom.

1110
00:50:28.795 --> 00:50:30.263
What a surprise.

1111
00:50:30.296 --> 00:50:31.831
To what do we owe this honor?

1112
00:50:31.865 --> 00:50:32.966
Oh. I don't know.

1113
00:50:32.999 --> 00:50:35.368
You and Dad are always so sweet
about keeping in touch.

1114
00:50:35.402 --> 00:50:37.804
I just kinda thought
it was my turn.

1115
00:50:37.837 --> 00:50:38.805
And look!

1116
00:50:38.838 --> 00:50:40.340
Groceries.

1117
00:50:40.373 --> 00:50:42.676
Oh. thank you so much. dear.
Dad. Juniper's here.

1118
00:50:45.211 --> 00:50:47.247
Building a house
for the birds. Dad?

1119
00:50:47.280 --> 00:50:49.849
Yep. Just gotta a put a
coat of paint on this thing.

1120
00:50:49.883 --> 00:50:53.353
I could help with that. I just
had my first painting lesson.

1121
00:50:53.386 --> 00:50:54.087
Kind of.

1122
00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:56.189
Anyway. I wanted
to let you know

1123
00:50:56.222 --> 00:50:58.191
I won't be available
much this week

1124
00:50:58.224 --> 00:50:59.526
because I'm going to be

1125
00:50:59.559 --> 00:51:01.461
submitting a project
to Little Light.

1126
00:51:01.494 --> 00:51:03.163
Oh. that's wonderful. dear.

1127
00:51:03.196 --> 00:51:04.597
You're such a good editor.

1128
00:51:04.631 --> 00:51:07.334
Oh. I'm actually gonna be
the writer on this one.

1129
00:51:07.367 --> 00:51:09.336
Yeah. I mean. there's
no guarantees

1130
00:51:09.369 --> 00:51:11.638
because we have absolutely
no track record.

1131
00:51:11.671 --> 00:51:14.474
But Paula really loves
Alex's artwork.

1132
00:51:14.507 --> 00:51:17.277
Alex is the muralist
I told you about.

1133
00:51:17.310 --> 00:51:18.578
I don't think you did.

1134
00:51:18.611 --> 00:51:19.779
No?

1135
00:51:19.813 --> 00:51:22.482
Oh. well I met him down in
Capitol Hill working on a mural

1136
00:51:22.515 --> 00:51:25.218
and we just decided to
give this thing a go.

1137
00:51:25.251 --> 00:51:26.720
Oh. that sounds nice.

1138
00:51:26.753 --> 00:51:27.787
Yeah.

1139
00:51:29.622 --> 00:51:32.325
So your dad and I were
wondering about. um...

1140
00:51:32.359 --> 00:51:34.561
the possibility of having
a little party.

1141
00:51:34.594 --> 00:51:35.628
Just a little one.

1142
00:51:35.662 --> 00:51:38.365
For your birthday.
towards the end of the month.

1143
00:51:38.398 --> 00:51:40.567
-End of the month.
-Just friends and family.

1144
00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.402
-Friends and family.
-Nothing to...

1145
00:51:42.435 --> 00:51:43.303
Maybe.

1146
00:51:44.270 --> 00:51:45.905
-[in unison] Really?
-Sure.

1147
00:51:45.939 --> 00:51:49.576
Uh... well you can let us know
and you can invite this Alex.

1148
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:52.679
-And Ethan. of course.
-Of course.

1149
00:51:52.712 --> 00:51:53.780
Ethan and I broke up.

1150
00:51:55.348 --> 00:51:56.583
I gotta run. Love you!

1151
00:51:57.984 --> 00:52:00.520
Okay. so our heroine
is a young girl.

1152
00:52:00.553 --> 00:52:05.358
She's imaginative. spirited.
occasionally exasperating.

1153
00:52:05.392 --> 00:52:07.660
I bet that probably
described you.

1154
00:52:07.694 --> 00:52:11.765
Well. actually. I found some
visual inspiration for us.

1155
00:52:12.599 --> 00:52:15.935
And I think she's
a little girl...

1156
00:52:15.969 --> 00:52:17.737
a lot like this.

1157
00:52:18.405 --> 00:52:20.740
-Ah. you liked it.
-I did.

1158
00:52:20.774 --> 00:52:23.576
I think that's exactly
what she should look like.

1159
00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:24.678
I love it.

1160
00:52:24.711 --> 00:52:25.912
-You do?
-Yeah.

1161
00:52:25.945 --> 00:52:27.714
Can't wait to start
drawing her.

1162
00:52:29.282 --> 00:52:30.483
So we're doing this.

1163
00:52:31.418 --> 00:52:32.719
We're really doing this.

1164
00:52:32.752 --> 00:52:33.820
Yeah. We are.

1165
00:52:35.655 --> 00:52:39.225
You know you're gonna have to
put your name on this. right?

1166
00:52:39.259 --> 00:52:41.294
Because Paula won't
publish a book

1167
00:52:41.327 --> 00:52:43.463
that doesn't credit
the illustrator.

1168
00:52:44.798 --> 00:52:45.865
I think that...

1169
00:52:47.434 --> 00:52:49.436
I would be more than okay
to put my name on this.

1170
00:52:52.038 --> 00:52:54.808
[inspirational music]

1171
00:53:01.348 --> 00:53:02.716
[clears throat]

1172
00:53:03.917 --> 00:53:06.686
I have two coffees for you.

1173
00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.987
Thanks Micah. Um...

1174
00:53:08.722 --> 00:53:11.291
[chuckles] We're not gonna be
too much longer.

1175
00:53:11.324 --> 00:53:12.926
No. Take your time.

1176
00:53:22.435 --> 00:53:24.904
[cheerful music]

1177
00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:34.481
[exhales]

1178
00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:41.654
[alert chimes]

1179
00:53:51.631 --> 00:53:53.500
[contained cheers]
Yes!

1180
00:53:54.367 --> 00:53:55.568
[giggles]

1181
00:53:56.636 --> 00:53:58.371
I like your dance.

1182
00:53:59.506 --> 00:54:01.641
You'll never guess
what just happened.

1183
00:54:01.675 --> 00:54:03.476
I know. I know it all.

1184
00:54:04.978 --> 00:54:06.479
Of course you do.

1185
00:54:08.915 --> 00:54:11.284
You haven't been
around as much lately.

1186
00:54:12.919 --> 00:54:14.387
You know why.

1187
00:54:17.524 --> 00:54:19.492
I haven't needed you.

1188
00:54:20.860 --> 00:54:21.961
Hm.

1189
00:54:25.799 --> 00:54:27.067
[chuckles]

1190
00:54:31.004 --> 00:54:33.573
You know it's bad when you
can count the amount

1191
00:54:33.606 --> 00:54:36.409
of sleep you've gotten in
minutes instead of hours.

1192
00:54:36.443 --> 00:54:39.579
But I guess that's life when
you're the mother of twins.

1193
00:54:39.612 --> 00:54:42.649
Well. you can hide out here
all day if you want.

1194
00:54:42.682 --> 00:54:46.619
No. I should get back soon.
or else chaos will erupt again.

1195
00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:50.390
You ever wonder how you managed
to end up where you are?

1196
00:54:50.423 --> 00:54:53.860
Yeah. I hear you. I guess I'm
just shocked at how I managed

1197
00:54:53.893 --> 00:54:56.830
to make one little compromise
after another

1198
00:54:56.863 --> 00:55:00.000
until suddenly I didn't even
remember who I was anymore.

1199
00:55:00.033 --> 00:55:01.935
They have a word for that.
you know?

1200
00:55:01.968 --> 00:55:02.969
Which is?

1201
00:55:03.003 --> 00:55:04.070
Adulting.

1202
00:55:04.104 --> 00:55:05.905
That is a terrible word.

1203
00:55:05.939 --> 00:55:08.508
And an even worse concept.

1204
00:55:08.541 --> 00:55:10.577
I guess I'm happy
I'm writing again.

1205
00:55:10.610 --> 00:55:13.813
but I forgot how hard it was.
I'm totally stuck.

1206
00:55:13.847 --> 00:55:16.816
Yeah. I get it.
I mean. I love my kids.

1207
00:55:16.850 --> 00:55:20.086
They're all I've ever wanted.
they're my whole life. but...

1208
00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:23.023
sometimes I just wish I could
get a vacation.

1209
00:55:23.056 --> 00:55:24.958
Or even just a day or two.

1210
00:55:24.991 --> 00:55:28.561
Yeah. Just...
just a day or two.

1211
00:55:29.062 --> 00:55:30.663
What are you thinking?

1212
00:55:30.697 --> 00:55:32.032
Nothing. I gotta make a call.

1213
00:55:32.065 --> 00:55:33.633
Yeah. back to real life.

1214
00:55:33.667 --> 00:55:35.035
-Okay. Love you.
-Love you.

1215
00:55:35.802 --> 00:55:36.803
Morning.

1216
00:55:37.737 --> 00:55:38.772
Americano.

1217
00:55:39.906 --> 00:55:41.708
-Thanks.
-It's Wednesday.

1218
00:55:42.709 --> 00:55:43.810
Yes. All day.

1219
00:55:44.844 --> 00:55:46.880
He goes to the art supply
store on Wednesday.

1220
00:55:46.913 --> 00:55:50.116
Otherwise the paints dry up
and become hard to work with.

1221
00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:52.719
Or at least that's what
he mentioned last week.

1222
00:55:53.219 --> 00:55:55.121
-Thank you.
-Mmhmm.

1223
00:55:57.524 --> 00:55:59.426
Can I get another one of these?

1224
00:56:02.629 --> 00:56:05.665
[upbeat cheerful music]

1225
00:56:05.699 --> 00:56:07.167
Rocket fuel for the day?

1226
00:56:07.934 --> 00:56:08.835
Hey you.

1227
00:56:09.936 --> 00:56:11.438
That was nice of you.

1228
00:56:12.072 --> 00:56:14.140
-I have something for you.
-Hm.

1229
00:56:15.809 --> 00:56:16.910
Are those the...

1230
00:56:16.943 --> 00:56:18.111
The finished drawings.

1231
00:56:18.144 --> 00:56:19.112
I sent a link to your email

1232
00:56:19.145 --> 00:56:21.448
so you can download the
digital version. but...

1233
00:56:21.481 --> 00:56:23.216
I thought you'd want
the real thing.

1234
00:56:23.249 --> 00:56:24.851
Can't wait to see 'em.

1235
00:56:24.884 --> 00:56:27.721
Just drew what was in my head
because of what you wrote.

1236
00:56:27.754 --> 00:56:30.123
So. uh... how are the rest
of the words coming?

1237
00:56:30.156 --> 00:56:33.226
Honestly. I'm a little stuck.

1238
00:56:33.259 --> 00:56:35.528
Could use some inspiration.

1239
00:56:38.665 --> 00:56:39.666
Road trip?

1240
00:56:41.234 --> 00:56:43.636
Wow. Is that yours?
That's a classic.

1241
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:44.571
I know.

1242
00:56:45.472 --> 00:56:47.707
Not exactly what I had
in mind for you.

1243
00:56:47.741 --> 00:56:50.076
Well. Mr. Ripley. I have
hidden depths.

1244
00:56:51.044 --> 00:56:51.945
Shall we?

1245
00:56:51.978 --> 00:56:53.646
Your boss... what about work?

1246
00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.481
I already called Paula.

1247
00:56:54.514 --> 00:56:56.516
even she thinks I need
a vacation.

1248
00:56:56.549 --> 00:56:58.752
Don't worry. Micah can watch
your stuff.

1249
00:56:59.552 --> 00:57:00.453
Coming?

1250
00:57:00.887 --> 00:57:02.155
Coming.

1251
00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.161
Wow.

1252
00:57:09.262 --> 00:57:12.565
[upbeat cheerful music]

1253
00:57:16.536 --> 00:57:18.805
I recognize this area
from when I was a kid.

1254
00:57:20.173 --> 00:57:22.742
Did you ever come here
with your parents?

1255
00:57:22.776 --> 00:57:24.144
No. I don't think so.

1256
00:57:25.011 --> 00:57:27.113
You should take the next
turn off.

1257
00:57:27.147 --> 00:57:28.581
Trust me.

1258
00:57:29.015 --> 00:57:30.684
It's what you're looking for.

1259
00:57:31.885 --> 00:57:33.253
I trust you.

1260
00:57:40.894 --> 00:57:44.798
[upbeat cheerful music]

1261
00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:55.742
This is exactly what I needed.

1262
00:57:55.775 --> 00:57:57.777
Me too. It's nice not
to be staring

1263
00:57:57.811 --> 00:57:59.279
at a brick wall for a while.

1264
00:57:59.312 --> 00:58:02.649
I thought getting out on the
road might spark some ideas.

1265
00:58:02.682 --> 00:58:05.051
Yeah. It seems like
you're winning that fight.

1266
00:58:05.085 --> 00:58:06.319
You doing a book.

1267
00:58:06.353 --> 00:58:08.154
Well. that's thanks
to you.

1268
00:58:08.822 --> 00:58:11.324
And to this friend.

1269
00:58:11.358 --> 00:58:13.126
She came along and reminded me

1270
00:58:13.159 --> 00:58:15.095
of all of my childhood
passions.

1271
00:58:15.995 --> 00:58:19.165
So now you're gobbling down
pop rocks any chance you get?

1272
00:58:19.199 --> 00:58:21.968
Okay. okay. So maybe not
all my childhood passions.

1273
00:58:23.636 --> 00:58:25.839
No. I think she just
helped me remember

1274
00:58:25.872 --> 00:58:28.008
that writing can be play.

1275
00:58:28.808 --> 00:58:32.312
I don't have to think about
the logistics and the marketing

1276
00:58:32.345 --> 00:58:37.117
and the analytics. that I
could just write something.

1277
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:38.785
Anything. anything at all.

1278
00:58:39.953 --> 00:58:41.855
Something similar
happened to me.

1279
00:58:41.888 --> 00:58:42.789
Yeah?

1280
00:58:43.156 --> 00:58:44.257
Yeah.

1281
00:58:44.290 --> 00:58:45.825
I had my first gallery show.

1282
00:58:45.859 --> 00:58:48.228
Actually my first show
anywhere. really.

1283
00:58:48.261 --> 00:58:50.764
And it went great. It did.

1284
00:58:51.664 --> 00:58:53.633
But when it came time
for the second.

1285
00:58:53.667 --> 00:58:55.669
I guess there were resentments.

1286
00:58:57.103 --> 00:58:59.272
And people were not kind.

1287
00:59:00.874 --> 00:59:01.708
And just like that...

1288
00:59:02.742 --> 00:59:04.944
All my passion for painting
was gone.

1289
00:59:04.978 --> 00:59:06.746
literally in a single night.

1290
00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:07.814
I guess I was naive.

1291
00:59:09.182 --> 00:59:10.817
But it really crushed me.

1292
00:59:12.352 --> 00:59:14.921
I didn't wanna be a part
of that world anymore.

1293
00:59:14.954 --> 00:59:15.822
Yeah.

1294
00:59:17.123 --> 00:59:19.893
And now you're
stuck here with me.

1295
00:59:21.961 --> 00:59:23.196
I am suffering for my art.

1296
00:59:23.229 --> 00:59:24.831
Oh yes. clearly.

1297
00:59:27.901 --> 00:59:29.936
I can see little Juniper
down there.

1298
00:59:33.206 --> 00:59:34.974
Wait. what? You can?

1299
00:59:35.008 --> 00:59:37.243
Yeah. Running around.

1300
00:59:37.277 --> 00:59:39.279
Feeling the sunlight
on your face.

1301
00:59:41.181 --> 00:59:44.818
Dreaming about all the books
you're gonna write someday.

1302
00:59:44.851 --> 00:59:45.752
[chuckles]

1303
00:59:47.153 --> 00:59:49.089
Come on. let's go
check out the town.

1304
00:59:49.122 --> 00:59:49.989
Okay.

1305
00:59:52.025 --> 00:59:54.861
[upbeat cheerful music]

1306
01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:08.208
Everything okay?

1307
01:00:08.842 --> 01:00:11.878
Yeah. Just ironic to be
talking about the past.

1308
01:00:12.479 --> 01:00:14.414
It's a text from
my old art dealer.

1309
01:00:14.447 --> 01:00:15.148
Yeah?

1310
01:00:15.181 --> 01:00:16.082
Yeah.

1311
01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:19.052
She has interest from
the Venice Biennial

1312
01:00:19.085 --> 01:00:21.054
to exhibit some
of my pieces. but...

1313
01:00:21.087 --> 01:00:22.389
I'll pass.

1314
01:00:23.189 --> 01:00:24.391
Hold on.

1315
01:00:24.424 --> 01:00:27.694
You're going to pass
on going to Venice.

1316
01:00:28.161 --> 01:00:29.029
Uh huh.

1317
01:00:30.830 --> 01:00:32.866
Will they pay some
of your expenses?

1318
01:00:34.034 --> 01:00:35.735
Sure. yeah. But...

1319
01:00:35.769 --> 01:00:38.138
I just don't feel connected
to that work anymore.

1320
01:00:38.171 --> 01:00:40.073
It'd feel false
to put my name on it.

1321
01:00:41.908 --> 01:00:42.909
Okay.

1322
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:45.278
What's that face for?

1323
01:00:45.311 --> 01:00:46.946
Okay. fine.

1324
01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:49.482
By turning down the chance
to exhibit that work.

1325
01:00:49.516 --> 01:00:51.851
you are pretending
you don't have a past.

1326
01:00:51.885 --> 01:00:53.853
Instead of just reckoning
with it.

1327
01:00:53.887 --> 01:00:55.822
If you come with me.
I'll say yes.

1328
01:00:55.855 --> 01:00:57.157
How's that sound?

1329
01:00:57.190 --> 01:00:58.091
Why?

1330
01:00:58.124 --> 01:00:59.392
Simple.

1331
01:00:59.426 --> 01:01:01.895
Because this can't possibly
be your only vacation.

1332
01:01:05.131 --> 01:01:06.833
[laughs]

1333
01:01:12.005 --> 01:01:15.275
[cheerful music]

1334
01:01:17.410 --> 01:01:19.079
You are going to have
to eat that quick.

1335
01:01:19.112 --> 01:01:20.413
You're gonna
get ice creamy fingers.

1336
01:01:20.447 --> 01:01:22.782
Oh. you seriously do not
have to worry about that.

1337
01:01:23.183 --> 01:01:25.285
You were pretty excited
they had raspberry swirl.

1338
01:01:25.318 --> 01:01:28.021
but I'll say... interesting
choice of toppings.

1339
01:01:28.054 --> 01:01:30.256
I'm an extra cookie crumbs
kinda gal.

1340
01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:31.224
Mm.

1341
01:01:32.125 --> 01:01:33.393
[in unison] You know
I could see myself

1342
01:01:33.426 --> 01:01:35.161
living in a place like this...

1343
01:01:35.195 --> 01:01:36.296
...someday.

1344
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:39.099
Jinx. You owe me a Coke.

1345
01:01:43.303 --> 01:01:45.939
Come on. Come on.
This place is awesome!

1346
01:01:47.841 --> 01:01:50.477
If you wanna go in there. you
gotta finish your ice cream.

1347
01:01:51.077 --> 01:01:53.079
You do not have to worry
about that.

1348
01:01:53.113 --> 01:01:54.014
Alright.

1349
01:01:54.047 --> 01:01:55.215
-I got that...
-Let's go.

1350
01:01:55.248 --> 01:01:56.349
-I got that covered.
-Okay.

1351
01:01:56.383 --> 01:01:57.150
Mmhmm.

1352
01:02:03.056 --> 01:02:05.258
I like this one.
Buy this one.

1353
01:02:06.326 --> 01:02:07.227
No.

1354
01:02:08.094 --> 01:02:11.231
But... maybe this one?

1355
01:02:12.999 --> 01:02:15.869
Oh. that is one of
my favorites.

1356
01:02:16.336 --> 01:02:19.305
You know what I think will
fall really nicely on you?

1357
01:02:19.339 --> 01:02:21.841
I think I have the perfect
something something for that.

1358
01:02:21.875 --> 01:02:22.976
Okay.

1359
01:02:24.044 --> 01:02:25.178
What do you think?

1360
01:02:34.888 --> 01:02:36.856
Uh. excuse me.

1361
01:02:36.890 --> 01:02:39.125
I came in with someone.
Did she leave? Or...

1362
01:02:39.159 --> 01:02:40.393
No. she's right over...

1363
01:02:40.994 --> 01:02:42.395
I'm right here.

1364
01:02:44.864 --> 01:02:47.400
You look incredible.

1365
01:02:49.235 --> 01:02:50.070
Thank you.

1366
01:02:50.103 --> 01:02:52.072
No. I mean incredible.

1367
01:02:53.406 --> 01:02:54.541
Thank you again.

1368
01:02:54.574 --> 01:02:57.010
Here. What do you think?

1369
01:02:59.212 --> 01:03:01.848
I love it.
I'll take both of them.

1370
01:03:01.881 --> 01:03:03.550
Thank you Roz.
for all your help.

1371
01:03:04.551 --> 01:03:07.554
Okay. I'll get changed and then
we can get back on the road.

1372
01:03:07.587 --> 01:03:09.189
Oh no. With you dressed
like that.

1373
01:03:09.222 --> 01:03:10.557
we're going to dinner.

1374
01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:13.326
Uh. excuse me. What's the
nicest restaurant in town?

1375
01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.929
I would definitely say
The Lookout.

1376
01:03:15.962 --> 01:03:17.964
Great wine list.
It's beautiful.

1377
01:03:17.997 --> 01:03:19.499
Right on the water too.

1378
01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.067
Um...

1379
01:03:21.568 --> 01:03:23.303
You're an inspiration.

1380
01:03:23.336 --> 01:03:24.304
Do you...

1381
01:03:25.138 --> 01:03:26.973
Can you do the same for me?

1382
01:03:27.007 --> 01:03:28.508
I have the perfect thing.

1383
01:03:28.541 --> 01:03:29.442
Alright.

1384
01:03:31.511 --> 01:03:32.345
Wow.

1385
01:03:33.546 --> 01:03:35.148
[laughs]

1386
01:03:35.915 --> 01:03:37.250
Wow.

1387
01:03:43.056 --> 01:03:44.557
You make me feel
self-conscious.

1388
01:03:44.591 --> 01:03:47.293
At least I was able to
pick up this cool jacket.

1389
01:03:47.327 --> 01:03:49.529
Try to pull off my best
James Dean here.

1390
01:03:49.562 --> 01:03:51.164
Oh yeah. Yeah.

1391
01:03:51.197 --> 01:03:53.366
I honestly can't tell
the difference.

1392
01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.135
Ah... you flatter.

1393
01:03:58.171 --> 01:03:59.472
This feels really good.

1394
01:04:01.941 --> 01:04:03.643
So much in my life has changed.

1395
01:04:04.944 --> 01:04:06.479
I think I really needed this.

1396
01:04:06.513 --> 01:04:08.014
Oh. and...

1397
01:04:08.481 --> 01:04:10.950
I think I have the title
for our book.

1398
01:04:10.984 --> 01:04:11.918
Oh yeah?

1399
01:04:11.951 --> 01:04:13.453
It's pretty simple actually.

1400
01:04:14.621 --> 01:04:16.022
Junebug.

1401
01:04:16.056 --> 01:04:17.290
Junebug.

1402
01:04:19.559 --> 01:04:20.593
It's perfect.

1403
01:04:20.627 --> 01:04:22.328
It's a lot easier
to be creative

1404
01:04:22.362 --> 01:04:23.963
when you shake
up your routine.

1405
01:04:23.997 --> 01:04:25.398
Yeah. Seriously.

1406
01:04:26.966 --> 01:04:29.069
I spent the last five years
never living in the same city

1407
01:04:29.102 --> 01:04:30.503
for more than a few weeks.

1408
01:04:32.339 --> 01:04:34.541
It's hard to have a
healthy relationship.

1409
01:04:35.308 --> 01:04:38.111
You can only live your
life like that for so long.

1410
01:04:38.144 --> 01:04:40.313
I feel like that part
of my life is ending.

1411
01:04:41.681 --> 01:04:44.484
Alex. you don't have
to say that.

1412
01:04:45.685 --> 01:04:47.620
I'm saying it
because it's true.

1413
01:04:52.325 --> 01:04:54.461
So... what are we thinking
for dessert?

1414
01:04:55.128 --> 01:04:57.364
Oh. uh... well. we just had
ice cream.

1415
01:04:57.397 --> 01:04:59.399
Oh. come on.
We're on vacation.

1416
01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.401
I'll get menus.

1417
01:05:01.434 --> 01:05:04.170
* I write love songs
but they're not about you *

1418
01:05:05.672 --> 01:05:10.410
* They pour out like that.
I'm so misconstrued *

1419
01:05:12.012 --> 01:05:14.381
* Some would say that
that's a sign *

1420
01:05:14.414 --> 01:05:17.617
* But I sit back and close
my eyes *

1421
01:05:19.452 --> 01:05:21.421
* I'm waiting for
the big bang *

1422
01:05:21.454 --> 01:05:23.356
* The one that takes us out *

1423
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:26.159
* The big bang that
kicks me out the house *

1424
01:05:26.192 --> 01:05:29.262
* The big bang. the ones
out of my mouth *

1425
01:05:37.437 --> 01:05:38.371
Well...

1426
01:05:38.405 --> 01:05:40.974
thanks for taking me
on your little vacation

1427
01:05:41.741 --> 01:05:43.443
And you're... you're nearby?

1428
01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:45.545
Yeah. Yeah.

1429
01:05:46.246 --> 01:05:47.580
Got a studio over there.

1430
01:05:48.214 --> 01:05:49.649
Okay. Good.

1431
01:05:50.583 --> 01:05:51.451
Um...

1432
01:05:52.385 --> 01:05:53.987
well. I'd better get going.

1433
01:05:55.555 --> 01:05:56.656
It was fun.

1434
01:05:56.690 --> 01:05:58.191
A lot of fun.

1435
01:05:59.592 --> 01:06:00.760
Yeah.

1436
01:06:06.800 --> 01:06:07.734
Okay.

1437
01:06:08.468 --> 01:06:09.669
Alright.

1438
01:06:11.071 --> 01:06:12.305
I meant to tell you.

1439
01:06:12.339 --> 01:06:14.574
I have just a few details left
on the mural.

1440
01:06:16.276 --> 01:06:17.510
I'll finish tomorrow.

1441
01:06:17.544 --> 01:06:19.346
I'd love you to come by
and see it.

1442
01:06:19.379 --> 01:06:21.214
Yeah. I'd love that.

1443
01:06:21.681 --> 01:06:24.050
Great. Text me?

1444
01:06:24.084 --> 01:06:26.186
-Yeah. I'll text you.
-Or I'll text you.

1445
01:06:26.219 --> 01:06:29.689
Yeah. or you can... we can just
exchange texts.

1446
01:06:31.458 --> 01:06:32.359
Great.

1447
01:06:32.392 --> 01:06:33.493
Okay.

1448
01:06:34.394 --> 01:06:36.496
-Good night.
-Good night.

1449
01:06:44.537 --> 01:06:45.605

[cheerful music]

1451
01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:28.515
Juniper!

1452
01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:32.118
Hey.

1453
01:07:32.152 --> 01:07:33.319
Ethan.

1454
01:07:33.353 --> 01:07:34.387
How are you?

1455
01:07:34.421 --> 01:07:35.522
I'm doing good. You?

1456
01:07:36.556 --> 01:07:39.359
It's really good to hear.
I'm doing well too.

1457
01:07:39.392 --> 01:07:41.728
I'm glad we ran into each
other. you know.

1458
01:07:41.761 --> 01:07:43.797
I had something I wanted
to tell you.

1459
01:07:43.830 --> 01:07:46.466
I signed up for my first
flying lesson next week.

1460
01:07:46.499 --> 01:07:47.634
What?

1461
01:07:47.667 --> 01:07:49.369
Wow. That's amazing.

1462
01:07:49.402 --> 01:07:50.603
What about you?

1463
01:07:50.637 --> 01:07:52.472
You look. uh...
you look different.

1464
01:07:52.505 --> 01:07:53.807
I guess I am.

1465
01:07:54.574 --> 01:07:55.642
I'm writing.

1466
01:07:55.675 --> 01:07:56.843
That's fantastic.

1467
01:07:57.911 --> 01:08:00.347
I guess I should still give you
that birthday pen.

1468
01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:02.682
Oh. that's very sweet.
but totally unnecessary.

1469
01:08:02.716 --> 01:08:05.352
No. no. I want to.
I wanna thank you.

1470
01:08:05.385 --> 01:08:07.687
You know. when you broke up
with me.

1471
01:08:07.721 --> 01:08:10.790
well... to be honest.
it was hard.

1472
01:08:10.824 --> 01:08:13.493
But it was the right thing
for both of us.

1473
01:08:13.526 --> 01:08:16.429
I really. really appreciate
you saying that. Ethan.

1474
01:08:18.531 --> 01:08:20.200
Nice to see you.

1475
01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:30.243
[upbeat music]

1476
01:08:31.578 --> 01:08:32.512
Morning.

1477
01:08:46.626 --> 01:08:48.461
So. did you have
a good day off?

1478
01:08:48.495 --> 01:08:49.929
I did. Thank you.

1479
01:08:49.963 --> 01:08:52.265
I hope I didn't leave you
in the lurch.

1480
01:08:52.298 --> 01:08:54.234
Oh no. we survived.
Kylie stepped up.

1481
01:08:54.267 --> 01:08:55.902
Took over some of your
meetings.

1482
01:08:55.935 --> 01:08:57.303
Okay. Glad to hear it.

1483
01:08:57.337 --> 01:08:59.673
Could you bring Alex by.
maybe end of day?

1484
01:08:59.706 --> 01:09:01.574
We could have a meeting.
all of us.

1485
01:09:01.608 --> 01:09:02.742
Sure. I was gonna pop out

1486
01:09:02.776 --> 01:09:04.377
and see the unveiling
of his mural.

1487
01:09:04.411 --> 01:09:06.546
so I'll just grab him then.
-Perfect. Okay.

1488
01:09:13.586 --> 01:09:16.489
Wait. wait. wait. wait.
Let's do this right.

1489
01:09:17.557 --> 01:09:19.426
Keep your eyes closed. Okay?

1490
01:09:19.459 --> 01:09:20.727
Here we go.

1491
01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:21.795
Drum roll please.

1492
01:09:21.828 --> 01:09:23.229
[chuckles]

1493
01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:24.731
Drum roll please.

1494
01:09:24.764 --> 01:09:25.899
Oh!

1495
01:09:25.932 --> 01:09:27.767
[imitates drum roll]

1496
01:09:27.801 --> 01:09:29.936
I'm really more of a
reader than a musician.

1497
01:09:29.969 --> 01:09:32.205
You mean more of a writer.

1498
01:09:34.641 --> 01:09:36.276
What do you think?

1499
01:09:37.544 --> 01:09:39.479
It's so beautiful.

1500
01:09:40.914 --> 01:09:43.850
Wait. I don't understand.
You could see her?

1501
01:09:43.883 --> 01:09:45.218
Who?

1502
01:09:46.386 --> 01:09:47.253
Junebug.

1503
01:09:48.521 --> 01:09:50.757
I told you. that was
my vision of Junebug

1504
01:09:50.790 --> 01:09:52.525
from when we were
on the beach.

1505
01:09:53.693 --> 01:09:56.429
But I thought I was the
only one who could see her.

1506
01:10:00.633 --> 01:10:02.802
I guess this means my
eight-year-old self

1507
01:10:02.836 --> 01:10:04.004
approves of you.

1508
01:10:04.738 --> 01:10:06.439
Not sure what that means. but...

1509
01:10:07.674 --> 01:10:09.342
I'm happy about it.

1510
01:10:16.516 --> 01:10:18.685
Hey. are you free
later this afternoon?

1511
01:10:19.085 --> 01:10:21.888
When I'm finished with this.
I'm a man of leisure.

1512
01:10:21.921 --> 01:10:23.490
At least for a few
days anyway.

1513
01:10:23.523 --> 01:10:26.326
Good. Paula wants to have
a meeting with us.

1514
01:10:27.594 --> 01:10:28.628
I look forward to it.

1515
01:10:28.661 --> 01:10:29.963
Mm-hmm.

1516
01:10:42.809 --> 01:10:44.978
I wanted to meet with you
in person

1517
01:10:45.011 --> 01:10:47.047
because I like and
respect you both.

1518
01:10:47.814 --> 01:10:51.451
But we are not going to move
forward with this project.

1519
01:10:51.951 --> 01:10:54.587
That's... too bad.

1520
01:10:54.621 --> 01:10:56.990
Can you...
tell me why?

1521
01:10:57.023 --> 01:10:58.692
Of course.

1522
01:10:58.725 --> 01:11:03.063
Juniper. it's a lovely story.
but we're a small boutique firm

1523
01:11:03.096 --> 01:11:06.066
and this would be
a risk for us.

1524
01:11:06.099 --> 01:11:08.368
It's a risk I just
can't take right now.

1525
01:11:08.835 --> 01:11:12.806
And Alex. it's more
than evident you're talented.

1526
01:11:12.839 --> 01:11:16.643
But the worry I voiced
to Juniper is still there.

1527
01:11:16.676 --> 01:11:19.646
The scale of your drawings
feels off.

1528
01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:23.516
You're still thinking in terms
of painting large walls

1529
01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:26.453
instead of the delicacy
of book illustrations.

1530
01:11:26.486 --> 01:11:28.888
Maybe if you had stayed
with your gallery work.

1531
01:11:28.922 --> 01:11:30.590
it would be less of a problem.

1532
01:11:30.623 --> 01:11:31.758
Maybe.

1533
01:11:33.159 --> 01:11:37.597
Well. um. thank you very much
for considering it.

1534
01:11:37.630 --> 01:11:38.698
[Paula] Of course.

1535
01:11:43.603 --> 01:11:44.504
Hey.

1536
01:11:47.173 --> 01:11:48.775
It's happening again.

1537
01:11:48.808 --> 01:11:50.410
No. Alex. It isn't.

1538
01:11:50.443 --> 01:11:52.145
This is not why
I make my work.

1539
01:11:52.178 --> 01:11:54.581
to have somebody tell me
what market it's right for?

1540
01:11:54.614 --> 01:11:56.983
Look. that's just
how she talks. Okay?

1541
01:11:57.017 --> 01:11:58.585
It doesn't mean anything.

1542
01:11:58.618 --> 01:12:00.420
It doesn't mean we can't
take our book someplace else.

1543
01:12:00.453 --> 01:12:02.055
No. I was happy
doing my work.

1544
01:12:02.088 --> 01:12:04.424
Alright. now I'm back
in the place I hated.

1545
01:12:04.457 --> 01:12:06.659
Don't. Okay. Alex.
Don't do this.

1546
01:12:08.561 --> 01:12:09.662
I gotta go.

1547
01:12:14.668 --> 01:12:17.671
Why is he going?
I don't want him to go.

1548
01:12:17.704 --> 01:12:19.039
Don't let him go.

1549
01:12:19.072 --> 01:12:20.774
Well. I wish you would
just go.

1550
01:12:20.807 --> 01:12:22.575
Fine. So I will.

1551
01:12:35.955 --> 01:12:37.691
[knock at door]

1552
01:12:37.724 --> 01:12:39.559
Come in. Katydid.

1553
01:12:39.592 --> 01:12:42.962
What exactly is going on here?

1554
01:12:42.996 --> 01:12:45.598
Well. at the moment
I'm making a rosé float.

1555
01:12:45.632 --> 01:12:48.535
Thing is that it's supposed
to be made with sorbet.

1556
01:12:48.568 --> 01:12:51.071
which I do not have.
But you know what I do have?

1557
01:12:51.104 --> 01:12:52.739
Is so much raspberry swirl
ice cream.

1558
01:12:52.772 --> 01:12:54.207
Yeah. That's not how
you make a float.

1559
01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.543
I'm gonna take this
away now.

1560
01:12:56.576 --> 01:12:58.812
You're not eight years old
anymore.

1561
01:12:58.845 --> 01:13:00.480
No. but those eight-year-olds

1562
01:13:00.513 --> 01:13:02.482
are still very much
a part of us.

1563
01:13:02.515 --> 01:13:04.551
Okay. What's going on?

1564
01:13:04.584 --> 01:13:07.087
I can't even really begin
to tell you. so...

1565
01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:10.790
let's just say that every dream
I ever thought I had

1566
01:13:10.824 --> 01:13:14.094
seemed to somehow magically
vanish into thin air today.

1567
01:13:14.127 --> 01:13:16.730
Dreams seem like magic.
but they're actually

1568
01:13:16.763 --> 01:13:18.565
the hardest work

1569
01:13:18.598 --> 01:13:20.800
if you ever stand a chance of
having them come true.

1570
01:13:20.834 --> 01:13:21.701
Who said that?

1571
01:13:21.735 --> 01:13:22.535
You did.

1572
01:13:22.569 --> 01:13:24.471
You said that to me
in high school

1573
01:13:24.504 --> 01:13:27.540
and I remembered it when I
wanted to drop out of college.

1574
01:13:27.574 --> 01:13:29.676
when I couldn't find
a job afterward.

1575
01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:31.811
when Ryan and I had trouble
getting pregnant

1576
01:13:31.845 --> 01:13:32.712
with the twins.

1577
01:13:32.746 --> 01:13:34.114
Okay. I get it.

1578
01:13:34.147 --> 01:13:37.117
You're the hardest working
person I know. Junebug.

1579
01:13:37.150 --> 01:13:38.918
Why would you give that up now?

1580
01:13:38.952 --> 01:13:40.754
No matter what's going on.

1581
01:13:43.690 --> 01:13:44.624
Thank you.

1582
01:13:45.792 --> 01:13:46.926
Come here.

1583
01:13:50.296 --> 01:13:52.165
What did I do to deserve you?

1584
01:13:52.999 --> 01:13:56.236
You pushed our mats together
at kindergarten nap time.

1585
01:13:57.570 --> 01:14:00.173
People really underestimate
the importance of that.

1586
01:14:00.206 --> 01:14:01.975
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

1587
01:14:03.710 --> 01:14:04.577
No.

1588
01:14:07.313 --> 01:14:08.214
No.

1589
01:14:11.951 --> 01:14:12.886
No.

1590
01:14:14.788 --> 01:14:16.022
It looks so good though.

1591
01:14:16.056 --> 01:14:17.257
It does not look good.

1592
01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:19.159
It really does.
Can I just lick it?

1593
01:14:19.192 --> 01:14:20.994
-No. please no.

[peaceful music]

1595
01:14:54.194 --> 01:14:56.830
I wish for...

1596
01:15:00.100 --> 01:15:01.968
Junebug to return.

1597
01:15:12.379 --> 01:15:16.716

Hey. Micah.

1602
01:15:48.014 --> 01:15:48.915
Hey.

1603
01:15:50.850 --> 01:15:53.586
Feels strange not to see
him out there anymore. huh?

1604
01:15:54.988 --> 01:15:56.389
Yeah. I guess he's moved on.

1605
01:15:56.423 --> 01:15:57.323
Yeah.

1606
01:15:58.024 --> 01:15:59.626
He's working across town...

1607
01:16:00.427 --> 01:16:03.797
on a mural on Fremont
by the park.

1608
01:16:03.830 --> 01:16:05.632
You know the
intersection there.

1609
01:16:05.665 --> 01:16:06.733
I know it.

1610
01:16:06.766 --> 01:16:09.703
Well... I'll get
your Americano.

1611
01:16:09.736 --> 01:16:10.937
Thanks.

1612
01:16:11.338 --> 01:16:12.339
Actually. wait.

1613
01:16:14.174 --> 01:16:16.810
I'm gonna try something
different today.

1614
01:16:16.843 --> 01:16:18.244
What would you like?

1615
01:16:18.278 --> 01:16:19.846
Surprise me.

1616
01:16:40.867 --> 01:16:43.336
[alerts chiming]

1617
01:16:45.872 --> 01:16:47.841
Hey. are you going
to the meeting

1618
01:16:47.874 --> 01:16:49.109
about the production timetable

1619
01:16:49.142 --> 01:16:51.011
or are we going to discuss
the next few weeks--

1620
01:16:51.044 --> 01:16:53.847
No. no. no.
No more meetings.

1621
01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:55.749
Juniper. could we move
the Handel book

1622
01:16:55.782 --> 01:16:57.717
to the fall release schedule.
-No!

1623
01:16:57.751 --> 01:16:58.918
I'm sorry. what?

1624
01:16:58.952 --> 01:17:00.854
I'm not going to the
production meeting.

1625
01:17:00.887 --> 01:17:01.988
I'm not going to
the morning meeting.

1626
01:17:02.022 --> 01:17:03.189
I'm not going to
the meeting meeting.

1627
01:17:03.223 --> 01:17:05.692
I'm not going to any more
meetings because I am quitting.

1628
01:17:06.326 --> 01:17:09.396
Yes. I am quitting.

1629
01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:16.403
See? Quitting.

1630
01:17:16.436 --> 01:17:19.105
Okay. I think we need to discuss
this in my office.

1631
01:17:19.139 --> 01:17:21.908
Look. I just had a glimpse
of another life.

1632
01:17:21.941 --> 01:17:24.077
a different life.
for one day.

1633
01:17:24.110 --> 01:17:26.846
And it has apparently made it
impossible for me

1634
01:17:26.880 --> 01:17:28.848
to go back to my old life.

1635
01:17:28.882 --> 01:17:31.317
Is this because I passed
on your project?

1636
01:17:31.351 --> 01:17:32.952
No. it really isn't Paula.

1637
01:17:32.986 --> 01:17:36.322
But I get to concentrate on
publishing my first book.

1638
01:17:38.358 --> 01:17:40.026
[Junebug] Yay!

1639
01:17:44.297 --> 01:17:45.131
Hi.

1640
01:17:46.966 --> 01:17:48.902
Thought you might be gone
for good.

1641
01:17:48.935 --> 01:17:51.771
I won't ever go.
How could I?

1642
01:17:51.805 --> 01:17:53.940
I'll always be you.

1643
01:18:03.516 --> 01:18:05.251
-Paula.
-Mm?

1644
01:18:05.285 --> 01:18:06.319
Oh.

1645
01:18:06.353 --> 01:18:09.089
I thank you for everything.
I really mean that.

1646
01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:12.158
Rob. it's been a pleasure.

1647
01:18:16.363 --> 01:18:17.997
Cheerio.

1648
01:18:18.932 --> 01:18:23.069
[inspirational music]

1649
01:18:32.579 --> 01:18:34.047
Oh. hey.

1650
01:18:34.881 --> 01:18:36.516
Hey Dad. Um...

1651
01:18:37.884 --> 01:18:39.853
Can you go into
the basement for me?

1652
01:18:39.886 --> 01:18:42.088
I need you to see if
you can find something.

1653
01:18:42.122 --> 01:18:44.090
Do you know where
my old CDs are?

1654
01:18:44.491 --> 01:18:45.992
Great.

1655
01:18:55.001 --> 01:18:57.270
* If you ever want me *

1656
01:18:57.904 --> 01:19:00.774
* If you change your mind *

1657
01:19:03.276 --> 01:19:06.479
* There's no river too wide *

1658
01:19:06.513 --> 01:19:09.015
* No ocean too deep *

01:19:09.616 --> 01:19:11.284

1660
01:19:13.486 --> 01:19:17.057
* I'll be there for you *

1661
01:19:19.159 --> 01:19:23.229
* And nothing would keep me
from loving you *

1662
01:19:25.031 --> 01:19:26.533
[groans] Sorry.

1663
01:19:26.566 --> 01:19:28.101
I have to put this thing down.
it's actually really heavy.

1664
01:19:28.134 --> 01:19:30.270
Easy.
Don't hurt yourself.

1665
01:19:30.303 --> 01:19:32.439
Woo! I need to do more
strength training.

1666
01:19:33.606 --> 01:19:37.610
Anyway... I did it.
I quit my job.

1667
01:19:37.644 --> 01:19:38.511
What?

1668
01:19:39.145 --> 01:19:41.047
That's a huge move.

1669
01:19:42.115 --> 01:19:43.016
I'm proud of you.

1670
01:19:43.049 --> 01:19:45.318
Thank you. but I have
something to say.

1671
01:19:46.119 --> 01:19:48.521
Alex. it was just one no.

1672
01:19:49.322 --> 01:19:51.358
I'm not stopping
at the first no.

1673
01:19:51.391 --> 01:19:53.259
You haven't learned the
lesson of your life.

1674
01:19:53.293 --> 01:19:55.528
You didn't like how your work
was being presented

1675
01:19:55.562 --> 01:19:57.097
so you changed all that.

1676
01:19:57.597 --> 01:20:00.266
Why can't we do the same thing
for our book?

1677
01:20:01.034 --> 01:20:02.302
What do you mean?

1678
01:20:02.335 --> 01:20:04.237
We can find another publisher.
or if we don't.

1679
01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:06.206
we can publish it ourselves.

1680
01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.608
Isn't that the lesson?

1681
01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:12.078
I guess so. Yeah.

1682
01:20:12.112 --> 01:20:15.482
I really want to bring Junebug
into the world with you.

1683
01:20:18.051 --> 01:20:19.619
And more importantly...

1684
01:20:21.488 --> 01:20:23.123
I don't wanna lose you.

1685
01:20:24.157 --> 01:20:26.626
Even if you don't wanna be
a part of the project.

1686
01:20:32.232 --> 01:20:34.467
I guess there's only
one thing left to say.

1687
01:20:35.435 --> 01:20:36.603
What's that?

1688
01:20:40.006 --> 01:20:43.410

1689
01:20:52.185 --> 01:20:54.320

should have ended.

It looks perfect.

1693
01:21:20.747 --> 01:21:21.681
It is.

1694
01:21:23.683 --> 01:21:24.551
What's this?

1695
01:21:26.019 --> 01:21:27.654
Just something from my past.

1696
01:21:28.588 --> 01:21:30.223
Or it could be my future.

1697
01:21:31.024 --> 01:21:32.158
It's complicated.

1698
01:21:32.692 --> 01:21:34.027
Huh.

1699
01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:35.628
How long until everyone's here?

1700
01:21:35.662 --> 01:21:37.130
I think about an hour.

1701
01:21:37.163 --> 01:21:39.499
You're sure you don't want
a big birthday banner?

1702
01:21:39.532 --> 01:21:42.002
Oh no. Dad. I don't need
anything like that.

1703
01:21:42.035 --> 01:21:43.003
Or balloons.

1704
01:21:43.036 --> 01:21:44.204
I'm not eight
years old.

1705
01:21:44.237 --> 01:21:46.039
Well. speak for yourself.

1706
01:21:46.072 --> 01:21:48.008
We've basically
already established

1707
01:21:48.041 --> 01:21:49.442
I'm a child at heart. right?

1708
01:21:50.176 --> 01:21:51.578
[chuckles]

1709
01:21:51.611 --> 01:21:53.646
I think maybe we all are.

1710
01:21:58.351 --> 01:22:02.422
Okay. I would like to give
a little birthday toast.

1711
01:22:02.455 --> 01:22:07.260
Um. not to myself. but...
to all of you.

1712
01:22:08.428 --> 01:22:10.663
I think birthdays are
a time that we should

1713
01:22:10.697 --> 01:22:13.967
look around and we should see
how fortunate we truly are.

1714
01:22:14.701 --> 01:22:17.437
To have such amazing parents.

1715
01:22:18.038 --> 01:22:20.373
Who raised me from
a little Junebug.

1716
01:22:21.107 --> 01:22:25.679
And such incredible colleagues
who have taught me so much.

1717
01:22:26.413 --> 01:22:29.349
And someone special...

1718
01:22:30.550 --> 01:22:31.751
who truly sees me.

1719
01:22:36.823 --> 01:22:38.258
Cheers.

1720
01:22:38.291 --> 01:22:39.592

1724
01:22:44.297 --> 01:22:45.532
I love you.

* Through every closed
and open door *

1726
01:22:50.637 --> 01:22:54.741
* I didn't even know
what I was looking for *

1727
01:22:54.774 --> 01:22:56.710
I wanted to ask you something.

1728
01:22:56.743 --> 01:23:00.613
On the jacket of the book
it says Alex K. Ripley.

1729
01:23:00.647 --> 01:23:02.248
What's the K stand for?

1730
01:23:03.116 --> 01:23:04.351
Oh. I didn't tell you?

1731
01:23:05.852 --> 01:23:09.456
Knight.
But I don't have any armor.

1732
01:23:11.658 --> 01:23:12.726
It's okay.

1733
01:23:12.759 --> 01:23:15.795
I'd rather have less armor
and more vulnerability.

1734
01:23:16.396 --> 01:23:18.765
After all. isn't that
the theme of our book?

1735
01:23:19.466 --> 01:23:22.535
I wouldn't know.
I'm not the writer.

1736
01:23:23.536 --> 01:23:24.804

1737
01:23:25.839 --> 01:23:27.240
* I found the love *

1738
01:23:27.273 --> 01:23:28.541
* I found the love *

1739
01:23:28.575 --> 01:23:31.678
* I found the love in you *
