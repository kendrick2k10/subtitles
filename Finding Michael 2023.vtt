3
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.160
Michael was my big brother.

4
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.280
He was a wonderful child.
very loving. very kind.

5
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.440
Mike was a very happy boy.

6
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.240
Good sportsman.

7
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.480
Lots of friends.

8
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.680
He was a bit of a superhero.

9
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.520
You know. if I had any problems.
I'd just go to Mike.

10
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.960
Mikey was tremendously sharp.

11
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.880
He was at the top level
of what he was doing.

12
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.120
but you'd never guess it.

13
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.040
I think he was just doing it
because he wanted to do it.

14
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.400
To reach the highest peak in the world.

15
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.080
Mike just really wanted to test himself.

16
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.600
To see how far he could go.

17
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.080
how high he could go.

18
00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.800
He died at the age of 22.

19
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.080
Having just become the youngest Brit
to reach the summit of Mount Everest.

20
00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.880
He was left alone on the mountain.

21
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.960
It's an awful way to die.

22
00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.200
Twenty odd years later
and completely out of the blue.

23
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.440
we're sent this photograph of a body up
near the summit.

24
00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.440
It looks like it could be Michael.

25
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.960
My heart says we should go and find him.

26
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.960
And if we can...

27
00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.560
bring him home.

28
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:04.520
Attaboy.

29
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.560
Eyes on the front. eyes on front.

30
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.120
Theodore is called
"Theodore Frederick Michael Matthews."'

31
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.880
We kind of both wanted
Frederick and Michael as a first name.

32
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.360
because Frederick is my dad's name
who passed away.

33
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.320
and Michael is Spenny's brother's name.

34
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.080
Oh.

35
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.720
I was 10 years old when Mike died.

36
00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.400
Careful. Focus.

37
00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.880
It seems so strange. right.

38
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.880
because I'm 33 now
and he died when he was 22.

39
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.120
so I'm much older than he ever was.

40
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.040
Good job. T.T.

41
00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.320
But I see him very much
as my older brother.

42
00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.200
I can do it.

43
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.280
And pedal. pedal.

44
00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.920
When we were getting
to know each other

45
00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.040
at the very early stages
of our relationship.

46
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.840
he told me about Michael.

47
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.000
and I just found
the whole thing quite shocking.

48
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.120
It's really sad.

49
00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.960
I think losing him was more difficult
than he can even probably comprehend.

50
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:11.400
None of us had even considered
the possibility of a body recovery.

51
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.720
It had been about two decades
since Mike died.

52
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.600
and it literally just came out of nowhere.

53
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.120
We received the photo.

54
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:25.320
and it's of a body
at about eight-and-a-half thousand meters.

55
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.160
similar to where we believed
to have lost Mike.

56
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.040
It feels like we could go and get him.

57
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.560
If that is something
that we're gonna consider.

58
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.400
we all need to be
on the same page with it.

59
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.880
Particularly my mom Jane
and my sister Nina.

60
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.680
Do you remember we all wore
red roses at the memorial?

61
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.720
Mm.

62
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.120
-Wow.
-This is. yeah. As in...

63
00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.480
And then just lots of
letters of condolence.

64
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.560
Could just read for hours actually.

65
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.280
Here's the Yorkshire Post.

66
00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:23.160
"Young Briton missing after record climb.
Storm turns Everest joy to tragedy."

67
00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.440
Mike was supposed
to summit on the 13th.

68
00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.240
and I think by the 14th.
we hadn't heard anything.

69
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.720
The phone rang.

70
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.280
I was called upstairs.

71
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.440
As soon as I walked on the room.

72
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.880
there was just this...

73
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.400
awful kind of palpable tension.

74
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.720
and Mom and Dad
just weren't themselves at all.

75
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.520
They said that a storm had come in
and. um. Mike was missing.

76
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.480
but. um. it was too long after by then.

77
00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.600
and I sort of knew that that was it.
he was... he was dead.

78
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.880
You don't know if he's fallen
into a crevasse or over the edge.

79
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.840
or whether he just. from exhaustion.

80
00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.280
sat down and collapsed.

81
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.760
I don't think
we laughed together as a family

82
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:32.520
for what seemed like
you know. years. as a kid.

83
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:39.760
I didn't really understand
what was happening.

84
00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.560
It hadn't registered
that I would never see my brother again.

85
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:50.000
I just assumed that even if he was frozen
in a block of ice. that he'd unfreeze it.

86
00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.360
- I love this.
- Yes.

87
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:59.440
- He loved that one. funnily enough.
- Yes.

88
00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.440
Spen.

89
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.680
That's a great photo.

90
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.680
Seventeen.

91
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.200
Seventeen.

92
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.360
Do you think now is a kind
of the right time.

93
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.880
I mean. given that it's been so long?

94
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:15.920
I think it's the perfect time
to try and bring Mike home to rest.

95
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.840
- To be with him. Yeah.
- I'm sure that's what he'd love.

96
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:19.240
Absolutely.

97
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.720
-More than anything.
-Not just for us. but actually for...

98
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.600
- Yeah. For him as well.
- ...for him also.

99
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.120
This is definitely something
that we want to do.

100
00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:32.640
But are we getting a bit carried away...

101
00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:36.560
with the dream of bringing Mike home?

102
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.200
All we're going on is this grainy photo.

103
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.280
There is one name
from Mike's expedition

104
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.160
that really stuck with me. um. as a kid.
and that's Dave Rodney.

105
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.880
Dave and Mike became really close.

106
00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:07.440
They shared a tent and climbed together.

107
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.320
More importantly. Dave was one
of the last people to see Mike alive.

108
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:21.680
-Dave.
-Spencer.

109
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.400
-How are you. mate?
-Great to see you.

110
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.360
-Welcome to your Alberta home.
-Thanks so much for having me.

111
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.000
Come on in. come right in.

112
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:30.480
Wow. the view's insane.

113
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.760
So. I wanted to show you
a little piece of history here.

114
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:41.080
This is indeed
what we shot on back in 1999.

115
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.200
-That's amazing.
-I know. right?

116
00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:45.600
-Look at it.
-And I have a little something

117
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:46.520
I can pop in there.

118
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:48.000
What does it say? What does it say?

119
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:49.560
That's the summit push.

120
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:53.040
Summit push.
I have. like. no video footage of Mike.

121
00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.120
-Mm.
-Like I haven't seen...

122
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:57.760
-Really?
-...Mike on camera like ever.

123
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:58.640
Wow.

124
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.480
-So. yeah. I'd love to see it.
-You're ready for this?

125
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.640
-Yeah. yeah. absolutely.
-You sure?

126
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.840
- Yeah. All right.
- All right. let's do it.

127
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.520
Is that the icefalls?

128
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.320
This is the Khumbu Icefall
above base camp.

129
00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.080
heading up towards Camp One.

130
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.040
There's Mike.

131
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.520
Nicely done. Mikey!

132
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.400
Cheers. mate.

133
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.560
Good job on you.

134
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.720
He took to it like a pro. he really did.

135
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:26.960
Michael will test this.

136
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.960
See? And Mike's going across
like it ain't no thing.

137
00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.280
- Look at that. skipping steps.
- Yeah. it's Michael.

138
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:35.720
Yes?

139
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:39.520
- He looks pretty comfortable. eh?
- Oh. completely.

140
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.240
- Yeah. pretty good.
- Yeah.

141
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:43.840
What's up. Michael?

142
00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.560
You had a nice base and bath
with one of the other group members

143
00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.120
didn't you. Dave. today?

144
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.720
That was you.

145
00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.400
Anyway...

146
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.120
Can I show you something?

147
00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.600
The family got an email
with photos of a body.

148
00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.480
Oh. boy.

149
00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.480
On Everest. saying that they thought
it could be Mike.

150
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.560
And I was wondering.
well. firstly. what you thought.

151
00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:11.440
Okay.

152
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.640
And secondly.
if you think it could be him.

153
00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:14.720
-Okay.
-Here.

154
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.600
-Oh. boy.
-So. there's the body.

155
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.480
Oh. wow...

156
00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.840
I don't wanna see that. that whole...

157
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.480
Does that look like it could be...

158
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:32.160
It might be.

159
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:35.000
I instantly recognize this.

160
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.680
So. Spencer.
this is my summit suit from 1999.

161
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.040
Oh. my God!

162
00:11:57.800 --> 00:12:00.560
But it also would have been
the exact same for Michael.

163
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.120
This is what he was wearing that day.

164
00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:08.720
I've seen this suit in kind of pictures.
right. of him and on the summit.

165
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.720
- so it's amazing to see it.
- Right.

166
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:11.840
It's. uh...

167
00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:14.360
It's strange.

168
00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.520
I mean. do you think it's the same suit?

169
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:19.400
From this angle. my goodness.

170
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:23.040
this red section here where we see
the loop and the Velcro.

171
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.080
that's it. right there.

172
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.720
-The Velcro...
-Yeah. There.

173
00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.920
And then you might say.
"Well. I don't see a black sleeve."

174
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.120
Well. it's because it's out of view.
This is covering it.

175
00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:32.200
Right?

176
00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.760
-Let's have a look.
-Yeah.

177
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.040
Then there's black as well.

178
00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.840
-So. yeah. Look. it looks like that.
-Mm-hm.

179
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.480
That's the only shot we have. huh?

180
00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:42.000
Yes. That is all we've got.

181
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.480
-Oh. no.
-I know.

182
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:44.520
Um...

183
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:47.000
But it could be. eh?

184
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:53.280
It... Listen. my God. this gives me hope
that I haven't had before.

185
00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:00.160
I feel like finding Mike
is achievable now.

186
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.440
It could become a reality.

187
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.560
So. you know.
we need to look at how to do this.

188
00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.720
how to plan it.

189
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.880
I'd love to go up Everest.

190
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.600
Don't tell mom. um.
that would be a problem.

191
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.880
I'm not a mountaineer.

192
00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.600
but there is somebody
that I've known for a very long time

193
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.000
whose advice on this
I would really value.

194
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:40.560
I remember we were at school
and we were in the theatre.

195
00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.840
There were a good four
or five hundred kids.

196
00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.360
you know. in the room.

197
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.520
and in walks this guy

198
00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:49.960
talking all about being the youngest Brit
to climb Mt. Everest.

199
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.760
- Bear!
- Hey.

200
00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:58.840
How you getting on. mate?

201
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.560
- You doing all right?
- Yeah. yeah.

202
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:01.440
Too long?

203
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:02.600
- How are you?
- Yeah.

204
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.880
It's exciting. Come on board!

205
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.160
Thanks.

206
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:09.360
So. this is... this is fun.
this is river living. Spen. at its best.

207
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.920
This is the kind of day you wish
you had a house boat. yeah.

208
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.840
After I returned from Everest

209
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.720
I spent a lot of time
in between expeditions going around.

210
00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.840
you know. speaking at schools.
did lots of schools.

211
00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:25.280
And. uh. one time I remember
really caught me off guard.

212
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:31.560
I remember being sat with all my peers
who thought he was amazing.

213
00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:33.840
And I remember thinking.
"Well. my brother is better."

214
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.800
I was a cocky little thing.

215
00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:37.480
This kid put up his hand.

216
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.560
Super cool. super confident.

217
00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:42.640
And he said.
"Do you know Michael Matthews?"

218
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.080
I mentioned something to him like.

219
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.040
"Oh. I think my brother was
the youngest Brit to reach the summit."

220
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:50.320
You could. you know.
hear a pin drop in that place.

221
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:55.440
He knew exactly who... who Michael was
and that surprised me.

222
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.240
I went down and I hugged him.

223
00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.440
and just said.
"Your brother was incredible."

224
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:05.280
And as for the record. it was always his.

225
00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.800
He put his arm around me
at the end of it all

226
00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.200
and was talking to me about
how brilliant Mike was.

227
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.920
and how he'd met him.
and how sorry he was.

228
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.200
And I remember saying to him.

229
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.360
"I'm never going to be able
to fill a hole of an older brother.

230
00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.960
but I'll always have your back."

231
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.000
So. tell me. what's been going on
with the whole Everest stuff.

232
00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:28.600
You know. Everest has been there
throughout my life. obviously.

233
00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.160
uh. with a kind of big Red Cross on it.

234
00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.280
I'm thinking that I would love to go
to the mountain and bring him home.

235
00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.680
And I wanted to talk to you just about
where would you go to?

236
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:42.480
-Would you stay at base...
-Well. the problem is. the problem is.

237
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.320
it's one of the most dangerous parts
of the mountain. as you know.

238
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.200
is base camp to Camp One.
through that Khumbu Icefall.

239
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.960
If you think of it like water.
tumbling over a waterfall.

240
00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.520
that's how the Khumbu Icefall is.
apart from it's frozen.

241
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:58.360
It's not about how big or strong
or determined you are.

242
00:15:58.440 --> 00:16:00.240
if you're in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

243
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.960
and one of these giant cathedral
sized blocks of ice starts.

244
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.280
you know. it's game over.

245
00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:07.640
In a way. it's kind of.

246
00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.640
you go through the jaws of death
at the beginning.

247
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.520
What for?

248
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:12.400
To get to Camp One.
to get a little bit closer?

249
00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:15.520
Stay safe.
don't let your ego rule that one.

250
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.080
And if you end up at base camp.

251
00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.360
remember you're already at 18.000 feet.
you're super high.

252
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.840
You need to be.
you need to be compos mentis.

253
00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:26.680
As soon as you start going up high.
less oxygen. worse decisions.

254
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:31.240
If you get hold of Mike.
I hear his voice screaming that one loud.

255
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.120
On average. seven people every year...

256
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.360
of those attempting Everest
will lose their lives.

257
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.240
and you know.
is that a stat you want to take

258
00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.120
when you're trying to find resolution
for your family

259
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.560
rather than create more heartache?

260
00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.040
Go to base camp.

261
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:52.960
Be a rock. and help coordinate stuff.
but stay at base camp.

262
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:54.480
I'll struggle with that.

263
00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:57.320
-Well. that's the Matthews in you.
-Yeah.

264
00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:58.680
You know? And I get that.

265
00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.680
But at the same time. as you know.

266
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.880
no mountain's worth dying
for second time over.

267
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.840
Stay alive. you've got a lot to live for.
you've got a lot of people that love you.

268
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:08.720
Yeah.

269
00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.720
There's only a brief window each year
in which you can physically climb Everest.

270
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:21.720
and straight away.
there's a pretty significant timing clash.

271
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.120
We're waiting on baby three.
which I'm very excited to have

272
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:28.440
so I don't have to be pregnant any more.

273
00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:29.560
-Can you sit?
-Sit.

274
00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.440
-Sit.
-Hear me? Sit.

275
00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:36.280
A little boy is due
just as I would have to leave.

276
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.480
Good boy.

277
00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:41.040
If it was our first child. um.

278
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:44.240
I think it would seem worse than it is.

279
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.880
But because it's the third.
maybe it's okay?

280
00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.320
I don't know.

281
00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.640
Gigi. Gigi. do you wanna tickle Theodore?

282
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.480
Gigi. go tickle Theodore.

283
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.120
For Spencer.
to be able to bring his brother back

284
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.080
would be like a really good thing for him.

285
00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:10.080
Because I think there's probably
a lot of emotions

286
00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:12.240
that he's kind of paved over.

287
00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.960
Losing your brother is a hard thing
to kind of process when you're that young.

288
00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.800
No!

289
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.760
I had a fantastic childhood.

290
00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:28.200
but showing weakness
and crying and showing pain

291
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.520
was not frowned upon.
it just wasn't really done.

292
00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:33.560
You know. our family was a real.

293
00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.800
you know. get up and crack on
kind of family.

294
00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.840
my mom included.

295
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.600
Have I ever seen him cry?

296
00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:46.600
Yeah. I have seen him cry.
He doesn't cry at the births.

297
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.520
But. uh. no.
I've seen him cry maybe twice.

298
00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.640
Pop The Lion King on. he'll cry at that.

299
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.640
See you later. Pig!

300
00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.960
- See you.
- Night-night.

301
00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.680
I love you. Gigi.

302
00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.280
Love you. Mama.

303
00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:01.880
Night-night. Gigi Bear.

304
00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.320
Done.

305
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:09.800
How are you feeling about the trip?

306
00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:14.760
Um. I think it's going to be great.
I think you'll find it hard.

307
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.720
-Find what hard?
-I think you'll find it

308
00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:19.600
harder than you think you will.

309
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:20.880
Oh. you mean emotionally?

310
00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.120
Yeah.

311
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.200
I'll have to ID the body.

312
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:26.080
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

313
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:27.640
How would you feel about that?

314
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:32.280
Well. I think if anyone has to do it.
it's probably a good thing that it's me.

315
00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:33.320
Yeah.

316
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.920
Um...

317
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.720
I don't know.
I'm hoping it'll be quite cathartic.

318
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.160
I'm hoping it'll be quite...

319
00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.200
-You know.
-I think it'll be like a lot of emotions

320
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.720
that you won't even realize

321
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.200
that you had about his death
and stuff like that.

322
00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:52.080
I think it'll be very difficult
to see your brother like that.

323
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.120
I would just. I think I'd...
I think I'd struggle with it.

324
00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:56.600
I think you need to prepare yourself

325
00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.640
that it might be very difficult
to have to look at him like that.

326
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.040
but somebody has to.

327
00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:05.880
Yeah. uh. I like. the whole thing
kind of feels exciting to me.

328
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:15.600
We know that Mike went missing somewhere
between the summit and Camp Four.

329
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:20.720
which would make this one of the highest
search and recovery missions in history.

330
00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:28.760
So. I need a search team like none other.
The best people possible.

331
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:37.400
I've been put in touch
with a remarkable climber. Nims Purja.

332
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:43.080
Who climbed the 14 highest peaks
in the world in seven months.

333
00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.880
We have to look all over the mountain.

334
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.680
We have to look at The Balcony
face around here.

335
00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.040
We're going to have to look
into the north side.

336
00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:07.560
and we're gonna have to look here
around this slope as well.

337
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.840
So searching even at sea level.

338
00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:12.600
like around a football pitch itself
is a huge task.

339
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:17.120
and at this big mountain
where. like. you're literally dying

340
00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:20.480
because no one can survive
above 8.000-metre peak.

341
00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:32.320
We will be probably conducting.
you know. at least minimum two searches.

342
00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:38.200
and in order to have two searches
we have to go four times on 8.000 meters.

343
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.040
Putting the abseil line.
flying the drones.

344
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.920
conducting the search in this death zone.

345
00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:50.160
We know all too well just
how dangerous Everest can be.

346
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.880
And if something were to happen
to anyone else.

347
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.240
um. looking for Michael...

348
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.120
then it just wouldn't be worth it.

349
00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.360
There's a risk involved
with everything what we do in life.

350
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.160
but this is. you know.
what I'm good at and I'm optimistic.

351
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.160
Otto is eight days old. Spen?

352
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.840
-Eight days old indeed. Yup.
-Eight days old.

353
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.600
Quite the looker already.

354
00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.800
The timing's obviously unfortunate.

355
00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:52.640
but you know.
summit season's summit season and...

356
00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.080
I think if we don't do it now.
it's kind of next year.

357
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.600
I'd prefer to be here with my family

358
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.880
but I think what we're doing
is pretty great. so...

359
00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:09.040
I don't feel great
about Spenny leaving. I'll be honest.

360
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.360
It's okay. my love.

361
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.800
I'll be in touch all the time.

362
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.160
No. you won't.

363
00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.120
-I will!
-You're on Everest.

364
00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:22.360
-Yeah. there's Wi-Fi there now.
-Okay.

365
00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.440
I think the kids are going
to drive me insane when you're gone

366
00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:29.200
because they'll want you to be back.

367
00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:31.960
I'm going to have a full bed
with three kids.

368
00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:43.760
It's a good thing what we're doing.
I think.

369
00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:47.040
and we'll be back before you know it.

370
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:50.480
-Yeah. hopefully with Mike.
-Um.

371
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.120
God. I hope you find him.

372
00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.880
I just can't wait till it's done.

373
00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.680
- I'm gonna miss you. darling.
- I'm gonna miss you. Spenny.

374
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:06.360
Come back in three weeks.

375
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.480
I'm gonna come back...

376
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.440
as soon as we can find him.

377
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.800
but it won't be. it won't be long.
don't worry.

378
00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:54.920
It's amazing to actually
have boots on the ground.

379
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.920
There's so much thought
that's gone into being here.

380
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.160
-Here. sir.
-Thank you. sir. Thank you. Thank you.

381
00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:03.480
I did. brother.

382
00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.640
Good. Yeah. Let's go.

383
00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.920
Sonam. the guide
who is with me. is fantastic.

384
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.960
Feels good to be in such good hands.

385
00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.480
- This is the team.
- Yeah.

386
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.640
This is our team who is going with us
all the way to base camp.

387
00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.280
Strong. strong.

388
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:22.640
Thank you. brother.

389
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:25.480
We have an eight-day trek to base camp

390
00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.400
in which we'll be acclimatizing
to the altitude.

391
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.360
and we're gonna take
the exact same route that Mike took.

392
00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:38.880
I'm really looking forward to re-living
what he went through in his final days.

393
00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.160
- Prayer wheel?
- Yes.

394
00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.920
-Should I make a wish?
-Yeah. You can. you can.

395
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.360
Mike went to Everest
with a guy called Jamie Everett.

396
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:02.040
We worked in the same office
in London.

397
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.720
And one afternoon.
Mikey was sitting at his desk.

398
00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:10.640
and I just came along
and just through down a brochure and said.

399
00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:12.680
"Shall we go and climb Everest?"

400
00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:14.520
And I remember it vividly.

401
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.440
he just looked up at me
and went. "Yeah. all right."

402
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.520
We'd both done some stuff before.

403
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.040
Switzerland.
we did some climbing out there.

404
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.960
and then we went to Aconcagua
in south America.

405
00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.680
Special Interview Jamie Everett.
Camp One. nine o'clock.

406
00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.600
We called him The Bull. actually.

407
00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.840
like the old bull.
he would just go slowly off

408
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:39.840
and just keep going and going and going.

409
00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:45.080
And then we went to Everest.

410
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.600
The trek in with Mike was amazing.

411
00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.480
It was like being in your own little
sort of National Geographic movie.

412
00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.760
They had to walk in to acclimatize.
so I joined on.

413
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.240
Jayne and I just got engaged.

414
00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:08.200
And we had a video camera.

415
00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.320
It's lovely.

416
00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.400
We're at Chaurikharka.

417
00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.560
and this is the little lodge
we're staying in tonight.

418
00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:20.040
Very much to have a record of
leading up. you know. to getting married.

419
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:23.160
We've got here.
it's a quarter past two.

420
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.240
We're sort of the advanced party.

421
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.360
Mike was always one
of the first to arrive.

422
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.480
Whereas Mike got here
about an hour ago.

423
00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:32.480
The advanced advanced party.

424
00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:37.440
We were all exhausted and he was there.
he'd showered. he got ready.

425
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.680
I was always the fat slow one

426
00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.960
and Mikey was always the one
who was. you know.

427
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.200
up the mountain
like a rat up a drain pipe.

428
00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.440
Wow. the yaks really run
across that bridge. huh?

429
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.200
No hands.

430
00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.280
Mike says it's just like a jacuzzi.

431
00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.280
I'm pretty sure it's the same river. Look.

432
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.040
Oh. that's fresh.

433
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.000
Yeah. Mike chose a good spot for a swim.

434
00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.320
We're near by the Namche.

435
00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.320
Wow. it's amazing.
How does stuff get in there?

436
00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.480
We have made it.

437
00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:46.280
A nice little climb up a hill.

438
00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.680
I remember getting there.
A little bit of civilization.

439
00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.360
That's like a full on pharmacy.

440
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:54.280
- It is. it is. Yeah.
- It's wild.

441
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.600
Here's Jamie
and Mike playing pool in Namche.

442
00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:00.600
Highest pool table
in the world apparently.

443
00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.360
I actually read about it
in the guide books

444
00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.160
and thought it was a swimming pool.

445
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:09.920
Very good.

446
00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Honestly. I wasn't expecting
the trek to be as beautiful as it is.

447
00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.880
I thought it was very much a kind
of head down. get on and go.

448
00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:24.480
The trek will be the boring bit.

449
00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:31.160
But actually. I'm absolutely blown away
by what we're seeing.

450
00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:32.920
You'll be able to see Everest here.

451
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.200
Is it the one there

452
00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:36.040
-or the one to the left?
-Yeah. in the middle.

453
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.600
- It looks like a pyramid. you know.
- Oh. wow.

454
00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:39.720
There she is.

455
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.520
Well. that's it.

456
00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:49.600
First ever view
of the highest mountain in the world.

457
00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:55.080
It became instantly clear that it really
is quite a big thing that we're doing.

458
00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.320
-Perfect. Yeah. Give us a hug. brother.
-And it's beautiful. Yeah.

459
00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.200
We're here.

460
00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:02.600
-Finally. huh?
-Fantastic.

461
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:10.120
This is the closest I've been
to Michael in 23 years.

462
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.520
And knowing that Mike is literally
just there brings a sense of...

463
00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.280
magnitude to what we're doing.

464
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.360
You can see how fast the wind
is coming off it.

465
00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:43.600
It's probably blowing about
a hundred miles an hour up there.

466
00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.600
This is the. uh.
this is the monastery of Tengboche.

467
00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:49.960
and there's a mug.

468
00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.280
Come here.

469
00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.040
I think there was a willingness
to engage with the idea that...

470
00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.400
by doing things in the correct manner...

471
00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:23.920
...then fortune might be more favorable.

472
00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:33.120
It's very important to them
to have the blessing of the monks.

473
00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:38.360
It was part of almost the passage
to then continue up.

474
00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:45.080
Yeah. you don't take it lightly.

475
00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.960
You kind of felt like prayer
in there was almost necessary.

476
00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.120
and I found myself praying
for a successful trip

477
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.480
and that we would find Mike.

478
00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:11.640
and you know.
he was really prominent in my thoughts.

479
00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:50.720
So. there is one memorial
around the corner.

480
00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:52.360
for the people who died on Everest.

481
00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.400
For everyone that's been lost
on the mountain?

482
00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:55.480
Lost on the mountain.

483
00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.800
Oh. that's cute.

484
00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.440
That date.

485
00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:11.000
God. it goes back to the 1920s.

486
00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.680
1922 is the earliest on record.

487
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.760
And they were all Sherpas. wow.

488
00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:24.080
1924. 8th of June. George Mallory.
Andrew Irvine.

489
00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.960
God. there's so many of them.

490
00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.280
There you go.

491
00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.680
Michael Matthews.

492
00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:56.160
- British. 13th of May. Sonam. look.
- Yes?

493
00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.160
-It's my brother. here.
-Oh. yeah?

494
00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.280
Look.

495
00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.800
-Yeah. Michael Matthews.
-Oh. Michael Matthews.

496
00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:06.320
British. 13th of May.
That would be end of next week.

497
00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.560
-Oh. it is. it is. yeah.
-Imagine if... Imagine if we found him

498
00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:11.720
on the 13th of May. that would be amazing.

499
00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:23.840
We've had no choice
as a family but to live with Mike's death.

500
00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:30.720
And seeing his name written
in cold metal dredged up old feelings

501
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:37.800
of kind of anger. I suppose.
for the way in which Mike passed.

502
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.240
Base camp.

503
00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.920
It's massive. It's like a city.

504
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:45.880
This is it. The mission starts now.

505
00:36:57.920 --> 00:36:59.240
-Cheers. brother.
-Cheers. brother.

506
00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:01.720
-Thank you so much for everything. yeah?
-Yeah. Good luck.

507
00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.800
The best guide in all of Nepal.

508
00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:04.840
I'll see you. my friend.

509
00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.200
-I hope to see you.
-Yes.

510
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.000
Have a great trip home
and safe journey. yeah?

511
00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.040
You also.

512
00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:14.640
Brother.

513
00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:16.240
-I'll head out.
-Alright.

514
00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.200
-You've got quite the camp here. bro.
-Yeah. man.

515
00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.320
It's amazing.

516
00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.840
All right. Spence.

517
00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:31.160
-Hi. guys. how you getting on?
-Hello. hello.

518
00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.720
Welcome to the planning tent.

519
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:36.360
Can I start by saying thanks
so much for being a part of this. uh.

520
00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:38.240
very important search
and recovery mission.

521
00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.520
it means the world to us.

522
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:40.640
So...

523
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.960
Cool. so by now. what the plan
is balcony is 8.450 meters

524
00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.120
and South Summit is. as you see here.

525
00:37:55.200 --> 00:38:00.200
it's 8.750 meters
and obviously this is a huge area.

526
00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.840
Once we get into the position
we'll fly the drone.

527
00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.440
We've got Suman and Brodie.

528
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.840
Okay. great.

529
00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.040
- Fantastic.
- So...

530
00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:12.920
Thank you.

531
00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:16.960
So we can fly the drone from 500 meters
from where we take off.

532
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.880
So from Camp Four. we should be able
to get to The Balcony.

533
00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:23.520
and you know. we can fly pretty close
to the mountain to check.

534
00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.200
Fantastic. That's what he was wearing.

535
00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:32.600
Uh. the same backpack. the suit.
a red North Face Himalayan down suit.

536
00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:36.320
exactly the same as this.
so this is what we're looking for.

537
00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.160
Yeah. obviously
it will be different colors now.

538
00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:45.280
but just so that you can see
where the patches are. maybe...

539
00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:50.400
He had a Russian oxygen system
but with a UK or American bottle.

540
00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.000
and it was a gray-blue color.

541
00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.400
His boots were black.

542
00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:58.920
and he was wearing a blue North Face hat
with a black trim.

543
00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.280
and he was wearing
a stainless steel Rolex.

544
00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:03.640
this kind of bracelet.

545
00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.440
A similar watch to this on his left wrist.

546
00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:11.320
- So that's what we need.
- Yep.

547
00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.880
On the back. you should see a picture
that may or may not be him.

548
00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:19.080
it was taken by somebody in 2017.
which is kind of part of the reason

549
00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.360
why we thought it might be possible
to recover his body in the first place.

550
00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:50.160
What these guys are saying
is this picture is below The Balcony.

551
00:39:50.240 --> 00:39:51.480
- Below The Balcony.
- But this guy is saying...

552
00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.200
Of who?

553
00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:59.360
- That's not him.
- That's not him.

554
00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:14.480
The only kind of lead that we had
that we thought could be Mike

555
00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.320
was kinda blown out
the water straight away.

556
00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.720
Wnd we were just told
that it was an Indian climber.

557
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.280
None of us knew for sure that
that was Mike.

558
00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:25.360
it was just a promising lead.

559
00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:30.440
So I think from us.

560
00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.360
-we'll search everything that we could...
-Yeah.

561
00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:36.000
...between The Balcony and South Summit.
and we take everything.

562
00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:38.480
- like. one step at a time.
- That would be fantastic.

563
00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.720
Good luck. Good luck.

564
00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.880
I have a lot of faith and trust
that the team are amazing.

565
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.960
and they will scour
the entire search area.

566
00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.200
Good luck for you. brother.

567
00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:55.320
If Mike is visible. they will find him.

568
00:40:58.560 --> 00:41:00.560
It's important to remain positive.
we're here.

569
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.800
We're just gonna have to look harder.

570
00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:26.880
There are so many elements
to think about.

571
00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:30.000
The altitude is one.
the weather conditions.

572
00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.240
The amount of searches
we're going to do at the Death Zone.

573
00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.200
-Thank you.
-All right. pal. I'll be on comms.

574
00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:42.160
-Cheers. Spencer.
-Be safe. brother.

575
00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:43.440
-You bring them down.
-Yeah.

576
00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.720
- Bye. brother.
- Bye. brother.

577
00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.520
- Keep safe. yeah.
- Yeah.

578
00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:56.000
Right out of the gate.
it's a jumbled mess of ice towers

579
00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:58.920
that come crashing down
without a moment's notice.

580
00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:11.960
The Khumbu Icefall
is dangerous but it's amazing. man.

581
00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:19.440
It's a river of ice that's coming
at you. only a metre a day on average

582
00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.800
but it might not move for 10 days

583
00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:23.280
and all of a sudden.
it can come hurtling down

584
00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.280
and just completely wipe you out.

585
00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:32.800
That's why we go so early
when things are still frozen in place.

586
00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:39.440
You just don't know
what you're gonna get that day.

587
00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:44.320
you don't know if where that
big long ladder horizontally

588
00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:47.160
was yesterday has smashed shut...

589
00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:54.280
...or if a rope going up vertically

590
00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.440
is no longer there and it's now flat.

591
00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:57.600
You don't know.

592
00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.680
I know Mike and I enjoyed that area a lot.

593
00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:02.840
Hello there. Michael.

594
00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.280
Hey. dude.

595
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:07.760
It's awesome. isn't it?

596
00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.120
So you just fixed this ladder here?

597
00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.280
Yes. Yes. Yes.

598
00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:14.960
It's like this. you know.

599
00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:16.240
Yeah. Yeah.

600
00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.880
Now it's okay. let's see if he's okay.

601
00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.960
Nice. nice!

602
00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.240
What do you think. Mike.
is it all right now?

603
00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.200
- Yeah. pretty good.
- Yeah.

604
00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:41.800
Once you get through
the Khumbu Icefall.

605
00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:45.520
you will reach the big slow climb
towards Camp Two.

606
00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.120
we call it Western Cwm.

607
00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.680
And you know what.

608
00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.880
we call that the frying pan
because it is so hot.

609
00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:06.720
When the sun's ray hit the white snow.
and the reflections comes in...

610
00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:11.440
-No wind. Sunny day. it's too hot.
-No wind.

611
00:44:14.720 --> 00:44:15.920
Uh-huh.

612
00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:20.320
Climbers literally get sunburn
on the palette of their mouth

613
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.600
because they're gasping...

614
00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:28.800
...for air and UV is burning them there.

615
00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:34.720
And you can either let it drive you crazy
or you can have a few laughs.

616
00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:53.440
We're really very happy
to see Camp Two.

617
00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:57.720
you see our dome tent on the right.

618
00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.920
Mike Matthews and I share that one.

619
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:20.280
To get from Camp Two to Camp Three.
it can be 30. 40. 50. 60 or 90-degree ice.

620
00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.600
And oh. my goodness. it is so harsh.

621
00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:01.120
Dave: My challenge
is to get those two things up this rope.

622
00:46:02.800 --> 00:46:03.920
all the way...

623
00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:06.160
...to there.

624
00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:34.880
Altitude's really. unbelievably tough.

625
00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:44.120
It became very obvious that
Jamie was having some serious trouble.

626
00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:50.120
I started to get something
called a "cerebral oedema".

627
00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:57.360
Your body starts to dump
all this liquid into your brain.

628
00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:03.080
It was causing him more and more pain.

629
00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:07.600
My legs stopped working
and then I couldn't sit up.

630
00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:13.120
It got so bad that we had to put Jamie
in a Gamov bag.

631
00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:18.600
A tiny little clear window
so that you're not sort of feeling

632
00:47:18.680 --> 00:47:19.960
like you're in your own coffin.

633
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:23.120
So Jamie's been in here
for about 15 minutes now.

634
00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:26.160
Pump it up to simulate a lower altitude.

635
00:47:26.560 --> 00:47:29.120
almost like flying him down
without doing so.

636
00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.600
They did that for me
for about five or six hours.

637
00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:40.840
When I got out of the bag I just thought.
“If I stay here. I will die.”

638
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.480
So...

639
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:45.120
I'm done.

640
00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:50.680
He didn't want to not continue to climb.
but he had to.

641
00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:53.760
Picked up some stuff.
Said goodbye to Mike.

642
00:47:54.240 --> 00:47:55.480
And that was it.

643
00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.000
Yeah. it's really hard for him
that he came back.

644
00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:55.560
Once you hit the beginning
of the South Col. you'll be like. "Shit!"

645
00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:17.960
I'll never forget the first time
that I saw Camp Four.

646
00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:26.000
A place where human beings
probably should never go.

647
00:49:32.800 --> 00:49:36.920
Literally. man. you know.
you see people on the survival mode.

648
00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.480
They don't really care about anything.

649
00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.560
They just wanna go to the tent
and lie down.

650
00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.920
You are like literally worried
about your life.

651
00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:48.400
There are only 14 mountains
on planet Earth

652
00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.800
that are 8.000 meters or higher.

653
00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.640
and that is what is known
as the Death Zone.

654
00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:56.520
where human life simply
cannot be sustained

655
00:49:56.600 --> 00:50:01.000
no matter how much supplementary
bottled oxygen that you get.

656
00:50:02.120 --> 00:50:03.480
It's simply a matter of time.

657
00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:11.320
It's been a rest day. although
there's been a fair bit of nerves.

658
00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:14.480
which has made it not so restful.

659
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:19.240
There's quite a big concern regarding
the amount of oxygen bottles that we have.

660
00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:23.000
and regulators and masks
and all that sort of stuff.

661
00:50:24.680 --> 00:50:28.360
A few of us had very serious concerns
about oxygen on the mountain.

662
00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:33.240
They were supposed to be provided
with Russian Oxygen systems

663
00:50:33.320 --> 00:50:37.320
but what transpired was that they had
the Russian systems

664
00:50:37.400 --> 00:50:41.680
but UK and US bottles.
which didn't fit the systems.

665
00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.680
Back down at base camp.

666
00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.680
I'm hearing. "Oh. if you file off
the edge a little bit on this one

667
00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:00.560
and put that regulator on.
that should work."

668
00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:08.800
What a day this has been.
boy. did I ever suck wind.

669
00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:12.200
If it wasn't for my good friend.
Mike Matthews.

670
00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:16.160
with a little pep talk. I don't know
if I would've made it. buddy.

671
00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.400
How you feeling. pal?

672
00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.720
I'm feeling just fine.

673
00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:20.880
-Oh. yeah?
-Slight cough because of the dry air.

674
00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:25.240
but I'm sure Dave's soup
will make everything all right.

675
00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.680
All right. Anything to add
for the viewers at home?

676
00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:32.800
Well. just the soup over here.
just how wonderful it looks.

677
00:51:32.880 --> 00:51:35.240
- Yeah. let's take a look.
- Yeah. the end of it.

678
00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:39.040
Whoa. it looks like
we're ready to eat. buddy.

679
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:44.000
Before we head off to sleep
and onward to the summit push.

680
00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:45.120
Hey there. Michael?

681
00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.600
I'm sure Mike
would have felt really excited

682
00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.120
ready for the summit push but also...

683
00:52:01.080 --> 00:52:04.000
potentially nervous or even fearful.

684
00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:09.920
The only consolation
is he couldn't have possibly known

685
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.520
that he was only hours away
from his death.

686
00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:18.640
It might have been
about 10 o'clock at night

687
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.280
where it was time to gear up
and get ready to go.

688
00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:24.080
I was climbing with Denis.

689
00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:27.000
This is the big one.
Let's hope the weather's good for us.

690
00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:28.160
Great.

691
00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:32.880
Denis and I were on the upper mountain
a little quicker than the other two.

692
00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:36.800
On the top of Mount Everest.

693
00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:40.240
I looked down at the entire world below me

694
00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:43.000
and I saw the clouds bubbling up
from down below.

695
00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.240
It was a cauldron.

696
00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:49.680
I'll never forget...

697
00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:55.760
the moment that I saw Mike
at the base of the Hillary step.

698
00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.640
I was on my way down
and he was still on his way up.

699
00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.480
And he looked right into my eyes
and I looked right into his.

700
00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:10.800
and he said. "Did you make it. buddy?"

701
00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:15.560
And I said. "I sure did
and now it's your turn."

702
00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:26.880
I went down to the South Summit
and something told me to turn around

703
00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.400
and look for him one more time.

704
00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:32.040
and he had just gotten
to the top of the Hillary step.

705
00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:35.760
and he turned just as I did it seemed.

706
00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:40.720
And I looked up and gave him one of these.

707
00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:43.840
and he did the same thing.

708
00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.280
We waved.

709
00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:55.360
I thought the wave was.
"See you soon. my friend."

710
00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:57.200
not "goodbye."

711
00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:20.680
I despise looking at this picture.

712
00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:24.680
All I see is a young man.

713
00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:27.120
you know. in the process
of losing his life.

714
00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:29.040
He's clearly struggling.

715
00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.240
He can't breathe.

716
00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.840
He's in agony.

717
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:36.560
You know. he's just...
he's literally gripping

718
00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:40.680
on to what I now know
to be a prayer scarf.

719
00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.640
You know. gripping...

720
00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:48.600
these literal final threads of hope.

721
00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:51.960
It bothers me.

722
00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:55.440
I hate the picture.

723
00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:12.240
So it's 5:15 on May the 14th.

724
00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:19.640
Should be probably
one of the happiest times of my life.

725
00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:21.120
Lying here...

726
00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.040
thinking about Mike.

727
00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:30.160
He was 22.

728
00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.760
The best explanation that we were offered

729
00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:39.120
was that his guide was going
in front of him. below him.

730
00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:43.200
because the winds were so high.

731
00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:48.760
At one point between the South Summit
and The Balcony.

732
00:55:48.840 --> 00:55:53.840
his guide turned around
and Mike was nowhere to be seen.

733
00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:03.440
I do still find the whole thing
to be completely unjust.

734
00:56:05.640 --> 00:56:07.840
I'd love to just move through it but...

735
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:13.120
I kind of don't want to let go
of it either.

736
00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:22.720
I'm so sorry. Mike.

737
00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:30.720
Oh. God.

738
00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:15.040
I feel quite confident
that if Mike is visible

739
00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.520
that we will find him.

740
00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:19.880
So up here.

741
00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:23.160
this is the South Summit.

742
00:57:24.440 --> 00:57:28.880
This here is The Balcony.
and the area we're here.

743
00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.240
this is known as The Triangular Face.

744
00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:35.960
We have an awful lot of resource
on the mountain.

745
00:57:36.040 --> 00:57:37.120
We have a drone.

746
00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:41.240
We have 10 seriously
experienced local Sherpas.

747
00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:48.000
The level of energy. the level
of strength it takes is massive.

748
00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:53.760
People struggle to just take the iPhone
out of their pocket

749
00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:55.480
and take one picture.

750
00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:22.360
Nimsdai. Nimsdai. can you hear me? Over.

751
00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:54.360
I'm beginning to think
that the identification process

752
00:59:54.440 --> 00:59:55.760
might become quite difficult.

753
00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:58.840
You know. the red summit suit.
it could be any colour.

754
00:59:58.920 --> 01:00:01.000
you know. it could be orange.
pink. white. gray.

755
01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:07.000
Do you want to try channel 15? Over.

756
01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.360
Camp Four. base camp.
Camp Four. base camp. Spencer?

757
01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.200
Spence. you copy that?

758
01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:05.520
Brodie. Nims. do you copy? Over.

759
01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.960
I can't hear anything at all. Over.

760
01:03:36.720 --> 01:03:38.120
Oh. shit.

761
01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:53.040
Nope.

762
01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.880
Nims. is that you?

763
01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:22.160
Santosh. can you. regularly.
so. every 15. 20 minutes just ask Camp Two

764
01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.680
to ask Camp Four what's happening?

765
01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.280
Thanks.

766
01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.640
Nothing else we can do.

767
01:06:03.440 --> 01:06:05.240
Suman relayed the message to me.

768
01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:08.480
so. it's like all of them
are on the mission.

769
01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:10.480
-All of the are out on the mission?
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

770
01:06:10.560 --> 01:06:12.720
Yeah. I guess they have seen something.

771
01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:46.520
Anything on any bodies?
Has the drone seen any bodies?

772
01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:51.920
According to what I heard.
uh. it might be a positive result.

773
01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.800
-Sorry?
-That we might get a positive result.

774
01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.520
Camp Four. base camp.
Camp Four. base camp.

775
01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:35.920
Spencer. this is Mingma. can you hear me?

776
01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:36.840
Over.

777
01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:43.800
He radioed down from Camp Four.

778
01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:46.960
I took the call.
he said he's found some bodies. but...

779
01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:48.080
and then it cut out.

780
01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:51.680
So. we haven't had coms all day
and then...

781
01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:59.560
Base camp. Camp Four. copy.

782
01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:02.200
Copy. Spencer. how are you doing?

783
01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.360
Good. mate. looking forward
to hearing how you guys are doing.

784
01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.920
Yeah. we are all doing good.

785
01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:11.160
Fantastic. Any luck up there?

786
01:08:15.160 --> 01:08:16.120
Up there.

787
01:08:16.640 --> 01:08:20.320
So one dead body we got like similar.

788
01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:22.800
Oh. my God.

789
01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:43.200
So. do you think it's him. or not?

790
01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:07.200
Okay. thank you.

791
01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.520
Okay.

792
01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:15.840
You know. sometimes my wild optimism

793
01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.600
doesn't see me through. you know.
and it's just...

794
01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:24.680
I was really hoping for a. just a strong.
like. bash we found him result.

795
01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:38.440
It's so frustrating.

796
01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:47.600
If we have to go home
and leave him on the mountain.

797
01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:50.640
it's just gonna be all for nothing.

798
01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:52.960
and it's just gonna be
like a total travesty.

799
01:09:55.880 --> 01:10:00.000
And. yeah. it's just. it's. you know.
it's not great.

800
01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:11.640
You know. we will be back up next week.
we'll have another look.

801
01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:14.480
And hopefully. we'll find Michael.

802
01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:31.360
There he is.

803
01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.640
- How are you. bro?
- Good.

804
01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:33.640
You okay?

805
01:10:33.720 --> 01:10:34.960
- Yeah.
- Good.

806
01:10:35.040 --> 01:10:36.160
My brother.

807
01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.720
Oh. thank you. thank you.

808
01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:41.760
There has been a lot of snow right now.

809
01:10:42.440 --> 01:10:45.920
and whole of the mountain
is covered in snow.

810
01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:48.960
Yes.

811
01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:50.080
-You okay?
-Yeah. all good.

812
01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.360
So glad to see you safe. mate. So glad.

813
01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:56.960
It's quite possible that
they've literally walked right by Mike.

814
01:10:57.040 --> 01:10:59.800
but. we know. if he's under the snow.
he's under the snow.

815
01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:04.440
We can't. we can't expect them
to run a rake over the mountain.

816
01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:07.480
-You all right. feeling good. healthy?
-Oh. yeah.

817
01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:13.920
I am keen to review all of the footage.
just in case we see a boot. a glove.

818
01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.720
you know. anything at all
that could lead to another clue.

819
01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:21.000
another lead. you know.
in the next search.

820
01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:24.280
- So. this is South Col.
- Yeah.

821
01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.760
So. this is South Summit.

822
01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.120
-Is that? Are those people?
-That's people of course.

823
01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:30.400
What?

824
01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.200
Yeah. We can see the person.
here a climber. here a climber.

825
01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:37.680
Oh. my God. It's huge.

826
01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:44.320
So. we are looking for a body that size?

827
01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:47.120
-They're like specs.
-And two parts in there that's...

828
01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.360
- Person.
- Yeah.

829
01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:51.840
-I understand the difficulty now.
-Uh-huh.

830
01:11:54.320 --> 01:12:00.080
Flying the drone isn't giving us
the results that we'd hoped for. you know.

831
01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:06.160
Bodies. you know. all over the mountain.
lots of leads to try and identify

832
01:12:06.240 --> 01:12:08.360
and that just simply isn't the case.

833
01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:15.240
We still have ideas to explore.

834
01:12:15.320 --> 01:12:19.400
But there really is a kind of
harsh realization

835
01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:23.320
that it is quite possible
that we won't find Mike.

836
01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:25.920
You know. this is. uh.
this is not a given.

837
01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:32.200
Coming across other bodies.

838
01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:38.440
I'm realizing that there are many families
that are in the position that we are in

839
01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:43.920
without the opportunity
to bring home their loved ones.

840
01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:48.960
Two Nepalese climbers. a climber from USA.

841
01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:52.200
China. South Korea. New Zealand.

842
01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:54.320
Another Nepalese.

843
01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:57.000
There's many more bodies
still on the mountain.

844
01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:09.120
I'm starting to feel that
if were completely unable to find Mike.

845
01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:13.760
and we have the resource
and ability to help another family.

846
01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:18.440
then we should absolutely
be exploring that.

847
01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:23.600
I'm just wondering whether or not
it makes sense at all.

848
01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:26.400
or whether it's too dangerous.
let's just talk about it.

849
01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:28.560
to take. you know. a different body.

850
01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.160
A Sherpa. you know. who. who...

851
01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:34.400
who's family would love
to recover the body.

852
01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:38.160
I'm just wondering if you knew
of any bodies that we could help with.

853
01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:41.920
This is a great idea.
Some people. some family. you know.

854
01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.400
they wouldn't be fortunate enough
to bring the body.

855
01:13:44.480 --> 01:13:45.680
Continue to look for Mike.

856
01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:48.680
but also try to do good for somebody else
at the same time as a Plan B.

857
01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.880
Yeah.

858
01:14:02.760 --> 01:14:05.840
I have bigger hope
from the second search.

859
01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:08.560
Because we're heading towards the summer.

860
01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:11.600
And if the weather is like this. you know.
obviously it will melt the snow.

861
01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:14.520
and hopefully.
the body will be discovered.

862
01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:20.080
But it is very dangerous with the heat
and everything.

863
01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:22.480
the whole of Khumbu Icefall is melting.

864
01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.600
At any place. you know. that could crack.

865
01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.520
If I don't find Michael.

866
01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:39.320
then. you know. why not we do a good thing
on the way down.

867
01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:55.200
The priority is still to find Michael.

868
01:14:55.280 --> 01:14:57.400
But if that's not possible.

869
01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:02.360
then recovering a body whose location

870
01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:06.400
is known on the mountain
certainly seems a valid option.

871
01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:16.040
Mike had a strong connection
to the Sherpa community in his final days.

872
01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:22.280
So. I've been through my list.
and I've come across Wang Dorchi Sherpa.

873
01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.120
who died last year.

874
01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:31.880
And Nims' team say that his body
is just outside Camp Four.

875
01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:35.600
And they also know his brother
down in Kathmandu.

876
01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:43.880
- Namaste.
- Namaste. Mingma?

877
01:15:43.960 --> 01:15:46.320
Yes. my name is Mingma Sherpa.
nice to meet you.

878
01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:47.520
-Spencer. how do you do?
-Oh. Spencer.

879
01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:49.240
I'm very glad to meet with you.

880
01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:50.800
-Thank you. thank you.
-Okay. please. have a seat.

881
01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.400
-Hello. darling. how are you?
-This is my mother.

882
01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:53.800
-Nice to meet you.
-Okay.

883
01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.680
-Thank you.
-You're very welcome.

884
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.440
Can you tell me what happened.
to... to your brother?

885
01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.880
Like where he was lost? How he died?

886
01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.760
- Sorry to hear that.
- Yeah. thank you very much.

887
01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.000
Have you tried to recover him?
To bring him down?

888
01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:48.760
Okay.

889
01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:50.080
How. how old are you?

890
01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:53.440
-I'm. uh. 33 years old now.
-Me too.

891
01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.360
-Oh. same.
-Yeah.

892
01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:55.680
-Okay. same.
-Same. same.

893
01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:58.200
-And we both have lost our brothers.
-Yes.

894
01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:04.320
Yeah. 23 years ago. I was 10.
and he... he also summited

895
01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:07.440
and died on his way down and...

896
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:14.240
um. I've recently with my family.
been trying to find him.

897
01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:18.560
-It's proving very difficult.
-Yes. very difficult to find. yeah.

898
01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:23.120
-Because 23 years is very. very long.
-Yeah.

899
01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.400
I heard about your brother. and your son.

900
01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:32.280
Um. and if we can't find Michael.

901
01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.840
if we could help you instead.

902
01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.720
-Because...
-Yes. you have nice thinking.

903
01:17:36.800 --> 01:17:43.160
If it's possible.
we would like to explore the option

904
01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:45.760
of returning him home to you.

905
01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.160
MINGMA S. Stay round here.

906
01:17:57.680 --> 01:17:59.680
-Worry.
-It's okay.

907
01:18:01.400 --> 01:18:02.560
It's okay.

908
01:18:02.640 --> 01:18:07.440
-My. my mother and father. very painful.
-Same. same.

909
01:18:08.240 --> 01:18:09.320
Um...

910
01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:13.800
-Apologies if I upset your mother. Sorry.
-Yeah. no problem. Yes.

911
01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.800
-Very important.
-Yeah.

912
01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:23.680
Can you. um... Can you tell me
a bit more about Wang Dorchi?

913
01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:29.840
My brother have a wife but his wife
already died before two years ago.

914
01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:34.360
because she had a cancer
and she had three child.

915
01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.240
and she had three child.

916
01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:40.560
One child is 9 years old.
one is 7 years old.

917
01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:42.360
one is 6 years old now.

918
01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.800
I have liked this photo. it's possible?

919
01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:47.600
- Yeah. yeah.
- Yes. this the... here.

920
01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:50.120
-Look at that. Happy birthday.
-Oh. yeah.

921
01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:52.680
-And it was his birthday when. recently?
-Yeah.

922
01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:54.600
- And you got this?
- Yes.

923
01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:01.200
-Wow. And this is your child here?
-Yeah. small one.

924
01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:03.360
Hello.

925
01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:05.440
Yeah. Look at this. sweet.

926
01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.320
Hello.

927
01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:09.840
I can't guarantee...

928
01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:12.440
-Oh. yeah. Exactly.
-...you know there's a number of factors.

929
01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:16.200
We are. just so you know.
we're still looking for Mike.

930
01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:17.240
Yes.

931
01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:22.440
Um. if we can help you.
Michael would've wanted that.

932
01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:24.160
-and our family would want that.
-Yeah.

933
01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.560
-Okay. thank you very much.
-No problem.

934
01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.160
This is just what I think we should do.

935
01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:00.840
This is our last chance now.

936
01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:07.160
Obviously. as Mike's brother.
I would love to find Mike.

937
01:20:09.360 --> 01:20:13.400
There she is. just making an appearance.

938
01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:17.200
You can see everything.
you can see the summit.

939
01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:19.080
I can see the South Summit.

940
01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:22.040
I can even see The Balcony.
Triangular Face.

941
01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.000
And there's hardly any snow.

942
01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:27.560
Total result for the search.

943
01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:34.240
Yes. copy.

944
01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.920
I've often wondered recently

945
01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.480
what that moment of finding Mike
would feel like.

946
01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:57.560
I've never sat down with someone
and fully discussed...

947
01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:00.960
the effects of Mike's death on who I am.

948
01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:04.480
So. it could trigger some kind of release.

949
01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:13.680
The whole point of the second search
being this late in the season

950
01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:16.520
was to give us the best chance
of there being less snow.

951
01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:17.480
and it's snowing.

952
01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:55.680
Spence. Nimsdai.
Radio check. over.

953
01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:58.240
Yeah. copy. Nims. Got you.

954
01:23:58.320 --> 01:24:02.480
So. Spencer. obviously.
there has been a lot of snowfall.

955
01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:11.160
But we check the area
that you were concerned.

956
01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.440
there is no dead body...

957
01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:14.840
that as Michael.

958
01:24:15.800 --> 01:24:16.800
Over.

959
01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:20.240
Did you say that you did not find Michael?

960
01:24:25.800 --> 01:24:29.040
And do you believe that you
and your team have done...

961
01:24:29.720 --> 01:24:31.520
the absolute maximum

962
01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:34.000
and bottomed out the search
for Michael. yes?

963
01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:36.440
Hundred percent mate. hundred percent.

964
01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:39.000
This was our second search and...

965
01:24:39.480 --> 01:24:42.320
now. we're gonna stop searching
for Michael.

966
01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:47.280
and we're gonna switch for plan B
with your permission. Spence.

967
01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:48.880
Hard copy. over.

968
01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:54.120
If it's your recommendation
to move to plan B. that's fine with me.

969
01:24:54.200 --> 01:24:58.080
Clock is ticking.
and we're still at 8.000 meters.

970
01:24:58.160 --> 01:24:59.440
We're going to crack on. brother.

971
01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:56.680
Hi. darling.

972
01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:57.760
Did you find him?

973
01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:00.560
No. No. no. Uh...

974
01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:01.640
The search is over.

975
01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.280
And. uh...

976
01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.480
They didn't find Michael.
I find that really sad.

977
01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:08.720
Yeah.

978
01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:11.720
-It is sad.
-I kind of thought you'd find him.

979
01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:14.960
I just feel. I think your mom is going
to be really upset.

980
01:26:15.520 --> 01:26:17.840
Oh. it makes me feel like crying thinking
of your mom.

981
01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:20.320
I thought you were calling me
to tell me you'd found him.

982
01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:23.000
I think she'll be really upset.

983
01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.080
Let me get a tissue. sorry.

984
01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:32.600
How are you?

985
01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:36.840
Feel a bit deflated.

986
01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.640
We. uh... I mean...

987
01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:46.760
So. what happens now?
You. you're going to pick up the Sherpa?

988
01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:49.440
Yeah. recovering Wang Dorchi

989
01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:54.840
is. um. still. still very dangerous
and pretty complicated.

990
01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:57.880
but much simpler than recovering Mike
because obviously. we know where he is.

991
01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:02.200
Yeah. I suppose.
it's an amazing thing to do for them.

992
01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:03.720
it's just really sad about Mike.

993
01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:08.800
It's certainly not the result
we were after.

994
01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:11.600
Oh. I can't. I just feel so bad for her.

995
01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:18.400
You know.
seeing Vogue cry like that. it's...

996
01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:24.080
um. kind of not what I was expecting.

997
01:27:28.640 --> 01:27:32.000
You know. I didn't think that by embarking
on this journey

998
01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:34.080
if it failed. it would hurt anyone.

999
01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:38.760
I don't want to make my mom cry.

1000
01:27:45.840 --> 01:27:49.880
Vogue just said. "It's good to remember
that it's just his body. not his soul."

1001
01:27:57.240 --> 01:27:59.160
I feel like it's his soul that...

1002
01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.200
we've disappointed.

1003
01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:45.360
Looking at the summit suit.
the boots. all the gear

1004
01:28:45.440 --> 01:28:50.080
and also.
from all the intel we had. obviously...

1005
01:30:10.240 --> 01:30:13.600
Spencer's family
helping to get him down

1006
01:30:13.680 --> 01:30:18.920
when Wang Dorchi's family couldn't afford
to do this. is a great thing.

1007
01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:22.160
Shove up!

1008
01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:13.720
I'm leaving Everest.
and potentially forever.

1009
01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:24.680
This chapter of looking for Michael
is well and truly closed.

1010
01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:30.400
You know. I'm literally flying down
the valley with somebody else.

1011
01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:47.400
The real priority now
is returning Wang Dorchi to his family...

1012
01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:52.560
and giving them what we wanted so much.

1013
01:32:09.840 --> 01:32:12.760
-Hey. How are you?
-Namaste. thank you so much helping me.

1014
01:32:12.840 --> 01:32:14.520
-I'm sorry. Thank you.
-It's okay. my brother.

1015
01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:15.440
Yeah.

1016
01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:17.800
I got it.

1017
01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:36.400
Is she okay?

1018
01:32:41.680 --> 01:32:43.600
Hopefully.
this will give her the opportunity

1019
01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:46.640
-to mourn her father properly.
-Yeah.

1020
01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:48.880
-Yes.
-Okay.

1021
01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:54.280
Hey. it was successful.

1022
01:32:54.360 --> 01:32:55.760
-You're successful.
-Okay. thank you.

1023
01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:57.960
-Are these his children?
-Yes. his children. yeah.

1024
01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:07.200
I'm sorry for your loss.

1025
01:33:11.040 --> 01:33:14.240
-Thank you. again.
-It's. honestly. it's... it's a pleasure.

1026
01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.000
Okay. Thank you. I know.

1027
01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:28.720
It's okay. listen. at least something good
came out of the mission.

1028
01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.480
-Thank you. brother.
-Thank you very much for helping me.

1029
01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:33.280
-No problem. Listen. it's...
-I'll never forget your help in my life.

1030
01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:34.600
Well. thank you.

1031
01:33:40.360 --> 01:33:43.040
I'm not gonna get his daughter's
crying out of my head for a while.

1032
01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:44.520
I don't think. that was. uh...

1033
01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:46.840
it's just incredibly raw.

1034
01:34:03.320 --> 01:34:05.760
I thought it was a wonderful thing
that they did

1035
01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:09.160
to bring another climber home.

1036
01:34:09.800 --> 01:34:10.760
to his family.

1037
01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:15.400
They were going through a terrible time.

1038
01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:18.760
and I think it will have given them
great peace.

1039
01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:21.760
It's just a shame that. uh...

1040
01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:24.680
Mike was never found.

1041
01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:37.320
Mike was so generous
and open-hearted.

1042
01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:42.600
he would've wanted us to have done
what was then done with Wang Dorchi.

1043
01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:47.320
And. you know. funny enough.

1044
01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.240
if there'd have been one ticket down
the mountain.

1045
01:34:50.320 --> 01:34:52.320
he would've probably given it to him.

1046
01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:54.600
He was that kind of man.

1047
01:35:02.440 --> 01:35:04.840
Seeing Wang Dorchi's daughter

1048
01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:10.680
have that opportunity
to grieve kind of helped me.

1049
01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:15.120
even though the body wasn't Mike.

1050
01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:21.400
It felt quite full circle.

1051
01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:50.600
Go say hi to Nanny Jane.

1052
01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:52.240
-Mama.
-Hi.

1053
01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:54.760
How are you. darling?

1054
01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:55.800
- Hello.
- Hi.

1055
01:35:56.920 --> 01:36:00.240
Great. great to have you home.

1056
01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:03.080
Yes. He does.

1057
01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:05.000
Hey. sweetheart.

1058
01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:15.800
I felt more emotionally charged
on Everest than I ever have in my life.

1059
01:36:17.720 --> 01:36:22.280
Pretty much all we did was talk
about Mike. think about Mike.

1060
01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:24.480
what happened to him. losing him.

1061
01:36:24.560 --> 01:36:30.120
And I think it allowed me to move through
the feelings of pain

1062
01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:32.920
and arrive at a place...

1063
01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:37.720
you know. all these years later of calm.

1064
01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:51.800
I have a much clearer sense
of who he was now.

1065
01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:56.000
and I found myself admiring him.

1066
01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:02.360
Heading through the Khumbu Icefall
at four in the morning. you know. aged 22.

1067
01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:04.520
you know. in the dead of night.

1068
01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.240
takes guts and courage.

1069
01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:13.600
We wanted to let you know
that we came to find you Mikey.

1070
01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:18.760
and we will always remember you
and we love you with all our hearts.

1071
01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:28.360
It's hugely important
that Mike continues

1072
01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:33.160
to be part of all of our family
for the next generation.

1073
01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:37.840
Uncle Mike went to climb Mount Everest.

1074
01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:39.560
which is the world's biggest mountain.

1075
01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:41.960
and he had an accident
and didn't come back.

1076
01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:44.320
-Dad. is that mountain Everest?
-Don't know.

1077
01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:48.160
No. That is a small hill in Scotland.

1078
01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:51.120
How Spenny went to try
and find his brother.

1079
01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:54.840
and what Mike's journey was like.
will be fascinating for the kids.

1080
01:37:54.920 --> 01:37:57.720
And. and he's alive there.

1081
01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:00.400
Yeah. there he was alive.

1082
01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:08.760
I'd love Uncle Mike
to be a figure that my kids can relate to

1083
01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:10.240
and aspire to be like.

1084
01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:14.080
I'd love to see him in them.

1085
01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:24.920
Knowing that he is buried
and not. you know. in plain sight.

1086
01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:29.360
has made it easier for me to understand
that he's resting properly.

1087
01:38:34.640 --> 01:38:36.680
Just because we didn't find his body...

1088
01:38:38.080 --> 01:38:39.960
doesn't mean that I didn't find him.
