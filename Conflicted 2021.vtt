(people speaking in the background)

320
00:12:59.004 --> 00:12:59.952

Still strong.

You ain't let that place
break you. not one bit.

326
00:13:15.164 --> 00:13:16.444
- You know. we might be able.

327
00:13:16.444 --> 00:13:17.563

328
00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:18.530

329
00:13:18.530 --> 00:13:19.480
- How you doing though?

331
00:13:22.706 --> 00:13:24.373
- Anything I can do?

332
00:13:26.222 --> 00:13:28.077
- Since you asked. it wouldn't hurt

333
00:13:28.077 --> 00:13:30.797
if you talk to your cousin Nicholas.

334
00:13:30.797 --> 00:13:34.430
Hunter. that boy is out of control.

335
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:37.941
But maybe with you being
back. it'll do him some good.

336
00:13:37.941 --> 00:13:39.274
- I ain't seen him when I walked in.

337
00:13:39.274 --> 00:13:40.981
- Ain't no way of telling
where that damn boy at.

338
00:13:40.981 --> 00:13:44.374
but you really need to talk to him.

339
00:13:44.374 --> 00:13:45.970
- Don't worry. I will. auntie.

340
00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.054

341
00:13:47.054 --> 00:13:49.332

344
00:13:53.894 --> 00:13:56.154
I don't make plenty of food for everybody.

345
00:13:56.154 --> 00:13:57.826
All right. get you a home cooked meal.

346
00:13:57.826 --> 00:13:58.793

- You know how I do.

352
00:14:14.887 --> 00:14:17.626

476
00:19:40.109 --> 00:19:42.125
I ain't seen you since I left the county.

You show up here like everything is good.

After you left. I found out everything

00:19:55.438 --> 00:19:58.336

bitches and all that shit.

484
00:19:58.336 --> 00:20:00.376

00:20:05.008 --> 00:20:07.320
- Bree. you're dead to me.

489
00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.237

So. where are you from?

778
00:32:55.045 --> 00:32:56.454
- So you're trying to say a bougie.

779
00:32:56.454 --> 00:32:57.686
- Not at all. not at all.

780
00:32:57.686 --> 00:33:01.602
The girl of Dunaway is not so powerless.

781
00:33:01.602 --> 00:33:02.574
- Oh. okay.

782
00:33:02.574 --> 00:33:04.314
Well. don't let the gray look for you.

783
00:33:04.314 --> 00:33:06.670
I'm very familiar with the hood.

784
00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.830
But after my brother Kevin got killed.

785
00:33:08.830 --> 00:33:10.420
I shied away from the streets.

786
00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.862
- I'm sorry. I know my bad.

787
00:33:11.862 --> 00:33:13.962
- That's okay. it was a long time ago.

788
00:33:13.962 --> 00:33:16.494

00:33:16.494 --> 00:33:18.683

00:33:24.102 --> 00:33:25.491
Trying to stay out of streets.

792
00:33:25.491 --> 00:33:27.266
but you're not too far removed.

793
00:33:27.266 --> 00:33:28.183
Am I right?

794
00:33:29.126 --> 00:33:30.506

00:33:45.370 --> 00:33:49.722
And that gray sweatsuit with
the coffee. dead give away.

- Look. Hunter. you seem real cool.

810
00:34:17.530 --> 00:34:20.230
but I'm not tryna complicate
my life right now.

811

- I'ma be real with you.

It's been along the time
since I were able to have

815
00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:31.182
a decent conversation
with a beautiful woman.

816
00:34:31.182 --> 00:34:34.539
What I'm saying. all I
wanna do is see you again.

00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:43.302
- How about I give you my card

821
00:34:43.302 --> 00:34:46.766

00:34:46.766 --> 00:34:47.666

(hip hop music)

826
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.542

Don't you know that nigga

Nobody get with it and stop tripping.

- I ain't even worried about it.

856
00:35:58.258 --> 00:35:59.278
Hunter will get over it.

857
00:35:59.278 --> 00:36:00.695
It is what it is.

Last time I heard you were

00:46:19.536 --> 00:46:21.977

It looks like you ain't
got too much experience

1100
00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:05.780
with collections.

1101
00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:06.780

Well. I don't have any
experience at all in collections

1105
00:47:14.342 --> 00:47:16.880
but I am a fast learner and I am willing

1106
00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.465
to do whatever it takes
to get the job done.

1107
00:47:18.465 --> 00:47:19.307

little gap in your history.

1111
00:47:25.232 --> 00:47:26.996
It looks like you're doing a
little bit of time in prison.

1112
00:47:26.996 --> 00:47:28.497
You wanna elaborate on that a little bit?

1113
00:47:28.497 --> 00:47:30.182
- I did do some time in prison.

1114
00:47:30.182 --> 00:47:34.388
Five years for conspiracy
charges a couple of years back.

1115
00:47:34.388 --> 00:47:36.796

1285
00:53:06.939 --> 00:53:09.077
I'm just a mediator
between you and the client.

1286
00:53:09.077 --> 00:53:10.660

Okay. this is where you'll

1328
00:55:34.245 --> 00:55:36.678
Does that sounded like something
that you're willing to do.

1329
00:55:36.678 --> 00:55:38.263

you talking to my desk

1340
00:56:12.587 --> 00:56:13.810

But (indistinct) for foreclosure.

1348
00:56:29.328 --> 00:56:30.250
there's nothing I can do.

1349
00:56:30.250 --> 00:56:31.920
All you can do is send the
documents to my attorney

1350
00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:34.391

1351
00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:36.641

So. how was your first day?

- Yo get the fuck outta here.

1369
00:57:17.875 --> 00:57:18.792
Is he dead?

1370
00:57:19.627 --> 00:57:21.044

1371
00:57:23.139 --> 00:57:23.972

I love you nigga. salute.

1380
00:58:04.958 --> 00:58:07.458
- Why are you telling me this?

1381
00:58:10.058 --> 00:58:12.811
- 'Cause I see you
traveling in the same path.

1382
00:58:12.811 --> 00:58:14.115

00:58:56.996 --> 00:59:00.264
I'm not playing with none

The fuck. man.

The more I tried to do right.

- The sad reality is though.
just 'cause you found yourself

1424
01:00:31.194 --> 01:00:34.611
doesn't mean our loved ones did the same.

1425
01:00:37.706 --> 01:00:42.456
- Nick was out there. fam and
I know what come with that.

1426
01:00:43.482 --> 01:00:44.859
That's my family bro

1427
01:00:44.859 --> 01:00:45.970
and I ain't letting that shit go.

1428
01:00:45.970 --> 01:00:47.279
- Hunter. it's done.

1429
01:00:47.279 --> 01:00:49.620
We can't lose you again.

1430
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.502
Don't let them boys knock
you off your square. man.

1431
01:00:52.502 --> 01:00:53.335
Come on man.

1432
01:00:53.335 --> 01:00:55.834
The town know how you give it up.

1433
01:00:55.834 --> 01:00:58.667
And you gon' just go back to that?

1434
01:00:59.677 --> 01:01:00.510
- I ain't doing it for them.

1435
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:01.769
don't do it for me.

1436
01:01:01.769 --> 01:01:03.869
- Hunter. you got family out here.

1437
01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:06.038
They finally see a change in you

1438
01:01:06.038 --> 01:01:07.529
and a little bit of tribulation come

1439
01:01:07.529 --> 01:01:09.689
and you revert back to your ways.

1440
01:01:09.689 --> 01:01:11.096
Come on.

1441
01:01:11.096 --> 01:01:13.213
- So what am I supposed to do. bro.

1442
01:01:13.213 --> 01:01:14.757
- Look around us.

1443
01:01:14.757 --> 01:01:17.112
You see the environment we in.

1444
01:01:17.112 --> 01:01:20.325
The prophets forewarn this.
they hope that it would stop.

1445
01:01:20.325 --> 01:01:23.205
But me and you can't keep hoping it stop.

1446
01:01:23.205 --> 01:01:24.622
We gotta stop it.

1447
01:01:28.194 --> 01:01:29.549
- I feel you.

1448
01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:31.845
- Hunter. I'ma leave you with this.

1449
01:01:31.845 --> 01:01:34.981
A righteous man is one
who submits his will

1450
01:01:34.981 --> 01:01:37.185
to do the will of God.

1451
01:01:37.185 --> 01:01:41.009
And the question you gotta
ask yourself. is it God's will

1452
01:01:41.009 --> 01:01:43.573
for you to Vince Nick's death?

1453
01:01:43.573 --> 01:01:46.740
Only you can answer that for yourself.

1454
01:01:54.073 --> 01:01:55.906
- I'll see y'all boys.

1455
01:01:58.494 --> 01:02:01.077
(somber music)

1456
01:03:06.848 --> 01:03:09.015
- Hey. go see who that is.

1457
01:03:16.012 --> 01:03:17.101
- Who is it?

1458
01:03:17.101 --> 01:03:19.158
- (indistinct) man.

1459
01:03:19.158 --> 01:03:20.506
- (indistinct)

1460
01:03:20.506 --> 01:03:21.586
- Shit. let him in.

1461
01:03:21.586 --> 01:03:22.586
- All right.

1462
01:03:36.261 --> 01:03:38.511
(gunshots)

1463
01:03:40.417 --> 01:03:42.817
- On me. this ain't no damn mug.

1464
01:03:42.817 --> 01:03:45.877
- Hey. yo shut the fuck up (indistinct).

1465
01:03:45.877 --> 01:03:47.127
Hurry up nigga.

1466
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:10.842
- Yo. hey yo. remember we
broken that motherfucking house

1467
01:04:10.842 --> 01:04:12.986
on Stockbridge and that nigga came home.

1468
01:04:12.986 --> 01:04:14.712
That nigga back that big gun out.

1469
01:04:14.712 --> 01:04:16.558
man. I thought he was done.

1470
01:04:16.558 --> 01:04:17.894
You heard me?

1471
01:04:17.894 --> 01:04:19.479
Yeah. he must ain't had that shit cop.

1472
01:04:19.479 --> 01:04:21.386
that joint was on safety or something.

1473
01:04:21.386 --> 01:04:22.706
All I remember your was
swinging on that nigga.

1474
01:04:22.706 --> 01:04:24.762
bang. bang. bang.

1475
01:04:24.762 --> 01:04:26.097
Don't be a fight like a motherfucker

1476
01:04:26.097 --> 01:04:27.190
trying to get about that bitch.

1477
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:28.362
- Shit. but we came up out that bitch.

1478
01:04:28.362 --> 01:04:30.445
- Abaolutely. absolutely.

1479
01:04:32.022 --> 01:04:34.974
Yo. what about the time little
title stole that police car?

1480
01:04:34.974 --> 01:04:36.518
- Man. the hood was on fire for weeks

1481
01:04:36.518 --> 01:04:39.250
behind that dumb shit. damn.

1482
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:42.938
- I missed that little nigga Ty. man.

1483
01:04:42.938 --> 01:04:43.898
They hood ain't been the same

1484
01:04:43.898 --> 01:04:46.822
since that nigga been gone. you feel me.

1485
01:04:46.822 --> 01:04:49.402
- Shit ain't been the same without you.

1486
01:04:49.402 --> 01:04:51.966
That's why I need you out here with me.

1487
01:04:51.966 --> 01:04:54.666
We the last of a dying breed. huh.

1488
01:04:54.666 --> 01:04:57.066
I don't know who's who no more.

1489
01:04:57.066 --> 01:05:00.816
Without you. it's like
a piece of me missing.

1490
01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:06.890
- I got you. my nigga.

1491
01:05:06.890 --> 01:05:08.640
- My nigga. my nigga.

1492
01:05:23.287 --> 01:05:25.287
- Give me a minute. bro.

1493
01:05:28.147 --> 01:05:29.347
I'm about to holla at my peoples. man.

1494
01:05:29.347 --> 01:05:32.514
I'll get back with you in the morning.

1495
01:05:35.379 --> 01:05:36.803

01:05:44.768 --> 01:05:46.567
I made some lamb and vegetables.

1501
01:05:46.567 --> 01:05:48.373
You want me to make you plate?

1502
01:05:48.373 --> 01:05:50.819
- Nah. actually just...

1503
01:05:50.819 --> 01:05:51.959
Hey. I just wanted to come check on you

1504
01:05:51.959 --> 01:05:54.088
before I turned in.

1505
01:05:54.088 --> 01:05:56.046
- You're not staying the night?

1506
01:05:56.046 --> 01:05:57.862
- Nah. I got some things
I need to take care of

1507
01:05:57.862 --> 01:05:59.112
in the morning.

1508
01:05:59.969 --> 01:06:03.915
- How are you gonna get
to work in the morning?

1509
01:06:03.915 --> 01:06:05.522
- That's the thing babe.

1510
01:06:05.522 --> 01:06:08.238
I'm about to fall back
for a minute from the job.

1511
01:06:08.238 --> 01:06:11.550
I got some other things
that need my attention.

1512
01:06:11.550 --> 01:06:13.126
- Wait. does this have something to do

1513
01:06:13.126 --> 01:06:16.730
with what happened to your cousin. Nick?

1514
01:06:16.730 --> 01:06:18.397
Hunter I'm confused.

1515
01:06:19.367 --> 01:06:22.414
One minute you all
excited about having a job

1516
01:06:22.414 --> 01:06:25.806
and the next minute you're on
a totally different mission.

1517
01:06:25.806 --> 01:06:28.686
Baby. you can't go back to your old ways.

1518
01:06:28.686 --> 01:06:29.519
- What you want me to do?

1519
01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:30.758
This is who I am.

1520
01:06:30.758 --> 01:06:32.425
I can't change that.

1521
01:06:33.714 --> 01:06:35.782
- That's why I didn't wanna do this shit.

1522
01:06:35.782 --> 01:06:36.615
- Do what?

1523
01:06:36.615 --> 01:06:39.305
- That's why. be with somebody like you.

1524
01:06:39.305 --> 01:06:40.145
- Somebody like me.

1525
01:06:40.145 --> 01:06:41.763
- Yes. somebody like you.

1526
01:06:41.763 --> 01:06:43.895
You come with this whole song and dance

1527
01:06:43.895 --> 01:06:45.518
about how you wanna get your life together

1528
01:06:45.518 --> 01:06:46.942
and turn a new leaf.

1529
01:06:46.942 --> 01:06:48.518
And it's really awesome bullshit

1530
01:06:48.518 --> 01:06:50.394
just to get what the fuck you want.

1531
01:06:50.394 --> 01:06:52.446
And I was stupid enough to believe you.

1532
01:06:52.446 --> 01:06:53.540
- What are you saying?

1533
01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:56.090
- I need to spell it out for you.

1534
01:06:56.090 --> 01:07:00.982
- You know what. I can (indistinct).

1535
01:07:00.982 --> 01:07:03.332
- Don't do that Hunter. don't do that.

1536
01:07:03.332 --> 01:07:04.165
- Don't do what?

1537
01:07:04.165 --> 01:07:05.870
- Don't make this like it's about me.

1538
01:07:05.870 --> 01:07:07.966
Like I'm the fucking problem.

1539
01:07:07.966 --> 01:07:11.286
- Yo listen. I'ma call you. all right.

1540
01:07:11.286 --> 01:07:13.146
- Yeah. whatever.

1541
01:07:13.146 --> 01:07:14.479
- Don't do that.

1542
01:07:18.682 --> 01:07:20.682

Hey yo. let's just continue

for one another without
complicating this shit.

1582
01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:26.394
'Cause at the end of the day.

you know a Hunter like my goddamn brother

1584
01:10:28.122 --> 01:10:30.446
and I ain't trying to
compromise that for shit.

1585
01:10:30.446 --> 01:10:31.542
- Nigga compromise.

1586
01:10:31.542 --> 01:10:33.746
You compromise that
when you got in my bed.

1587
01:10:33.746 --> 01:10:35.574
So you can miss me with all that shit.

1588
01:10:35.574 --> 01:10:38.934
- Yo. shut the up and
fix your goddamn face.

1589
01:10:38.934 --> 01:10:41.033
- Nigga. whatever.

1590
01:10:41.033 --> 01:10:42.566
Take your phone.

1591
01:10:42.566 --> 01:10:43.983
And lock my door.

1592
01:10:49.568 --> 01:10:50.710
- What's up with you man.

1593
01:10:50.710 --> 01:10:51.984
You look a little drain. man.

1594
01:10:51.984 --> 01:10:53.126
You had a long night?

1596
01:10:55.401 --> 01:10:57.648

1597

You all on social media liking

That's just a illusion. man.

Your momma is the hoe.

- You see what I'm saying?

1823
01:19:25.804 --> 01:19:28.068
Real though. let me halla

1824
01:19:28.068 --> 01:19:30.375

01:19:30.375 --> 01:19:32.325

01:19:32.325 --> 01:19:34.084
- Man. shut the fuck up

01:19:34.084 --> 01:19:35.208

1828
01:19:35.208 --> 01:19:40.041
You ain't say that shit when

01:20:02.424 --> 01:20:04.632
But I got this little right down.

But wait. did you see Hunter trying to act

1858
01:20:46.058 --> 01:20:47.876

1859
01:20:47.876 --> 01:20:49.452
Like. are you nuts?

1860
01:20:49.452 --> 01:20:51.141
Like I already know what's like that.

1861
01:20:51.141 --> 01:20:54.044
- No girl. did you see the
look on Valentine's face?

1862
01:20:54.044 --> 01:20:56.983
Yo. that nigga was a hot bitch.

1863
01:20:56.983 --> 01:20:59.788
I'm talking about steaming.

1864
01:20:59.788 --> 01:21:02.128
- I'm not thinking about Valentine's ass.

1865
01:21:02.128 --> 01:21:04.500
That nigga know what it is.

1866
01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:06.676
Yo though. so for real shit.

1867
01:21:06.676 --> 01:21:09.268
you might wanna fall back from the anyway.

1868
01:21:09.268 --> 01:21:10.334
- Why you say that?

1869
01:21:10.334 --> 01:21:13.440
- 'Cause that nigga was in his village yo.

1870
01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:17.296
I don't wanna see your ass get caught up.

1871
01:21:17.296 --> 01:21:18.960
- You know what. you might be right.

1872
01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:20.548
It's all good 'cause I got something else

1873
01:21:20.548 --> 01:21:22.380
I need to be focused on anyway.

1874
01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:23.213
- Hmm Hmm.

1875
01:21:24.704 --> 01:21:26.024
- You know what I'm talking about?

1876
01:21:26.024 --> 01:21:27.240
- Hear you. poop.

1877
01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:28.657
- I already know.

1878
01:21:49.168 --> 01:21:50.324
- What's up (indistinct).

1879
01:21:50.324 --> 01:21:51.388
- Hey baby.

1880
01:21:51.388 --> 01:21:53.055
- What you doing up?

1881
01:21:54.604 --> 01:21:57.204
What's the matter. why are you crying?

1882
01:21:57.204 --> 01:21:58.763
- Just thinking about my brother.

1883
01:21:58.763 --> 01:22:00.836
I'm all right though.

1884
01:22:00.836 --> 01:22:02.940
- You miss him. don't you?

1885
01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:06.190
- You have no idea how much I miss him.

1886
01:22:07.096 --> 01:22:08.429
He was my heart.

1887
01:22:09.524 --> 01:22:12.107
Kevin's death was so premature.

1888
01:22:12.942 --> 01:22:16.025
He was so ambitious and full of life.

1889
01:22:17.008 --> 01:22:21.448
I just don't understand
why anybody would hurt him.

1890
01:22:21.448 --> 01:22:23.652
- Babe. sometime God
allow things to happen

1891
01:22:23.652 --> 01:22:25.812
that we don't understand.

1892
01:22:25.812 --> 01:22:28.499
- I'm not questioning God. baby.

1893
01:22:28.499 --> 01:22:30.416
I just miss my brother.

1894
01:22:31.390 --> 01:22:33.685
You would have loved him.

1895
01:22:33.685 --> 01:22:37.152
- If he was anything like
you. I know I would have.

1896
01:22:37.152 --> 01:22:40.897
- You have so many of the same
characteristics. it's crazy.

1897
01:22:40.897 --> 01:22:44.367
There's so much how am I seeing you.

1898
01:22:44.367 --> 01:22:45.638
That's why it scares me to see you

1899
01:22:45.638 --> 01:22:48.448
go back to your old ways. baby.

1900
01:22:48.448 --> 01:22:51.611
- Babe. you already know
what I'm doing is temporary.

1901
01:22:51.611 --> 01:22:56.096
- But Hunter. something
bad is gonna happen.

1902
01:22:56.096 --> 01:22:57.536
- Why do you keep saying that?

1903
01:22:57.536 --> 01:23:01.916
- Baby. because I can't
explain it. but I can feel it.

1904
01:23:01.916 --> 01:23:03.508
This is the exact same way I felt

1905
01:23:03.508 --> 01:23:05.908
before Kevin got killed.

1906
01:23:05.908 --> 01:23:09.148
Something bad is gonna happen. babe.

1907
01:23:09.148 --> 01:23:12.971
- You need to relax and stop worrying.

1908
01:23:12.971 --> 01:23:15.236
Everything will be all right.

1909
01:23:15.236 --> 01:23:16.903
Trust me. all right.

1910
01:23:17.772 --> 01:23:18.760
- If you say so.

1911
01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.532
- Come here.

1912
01:23:20.532 --> 01:23:22.949
(slow music)

1913
01:24:19.321 --> 01:24:20.154
Get that back.

1914
01:24:20.154 --> 01:24:20.987
- Yo. Hunter. what are you doing. man.

1915
01:24:20.987 --> 01:24:23.056
- Don't do that. I'll
need that back from you.

1916
01:24:23.056 --> 01:24:24.223
- Come on man.

1917
01:24:25.248 --> 01:24:28.248
(suspenseful music)

1918
01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:43.034
(gunshots)

1919
01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:04.037
(slow music)

1920
01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:38.193
- Egypt to this or LA.

1921
01:25:41.459 --> 01:25:42.292
- It's Hunter.

1922
01:25:42.292 --> 01:25:43.125
- Hunter.

1923
01:25:45.268 --> 01:25:46.768
Hunter. what's up.

1924
01:25:51.096 --> 01:25:52.429
So it's all set.

1925
01:25:53.272 --> 01:25:55.522
All right. we'll handle it.

1926
01:25:57.693 --> 01:25:59.644
Excuse me. fellas.

1927
01:25:59.644 --> 01:26:02.227
(upbeat music)

1928
01:26:23.452 --> 01:26:25.340
- Hey yo. fam. what's good up there. man.

1929
01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:26.764
What's going on.

1930
01:26:26.764 --> 01:26:30.591
- Things are good. business is good.

1931
01:26:30.591 --> 01:26:32.856
but there's a thing we need taken care of.

1932
01:26:32.856 --> 01:26:34.416
- Are you saying you need me?

1933
01:26:34.416 --> 01:26:35.913
- Yeah. we wanna need you.

1934
01:26:35.913 --> 01:26:37.700

You know I'm on the way.

- I'll see you when you get here.

1938
01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:42.913

01:27:25.864 --> 01:27:28.040
- Boy. who car you got.

01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:29.332
- That's my car. auntie.

1944
01:27:31.072 --> 01:27:32.572

You know I liked that fancy.

1949
01:27:45.431 --> 01:27:46.688
Do you need something?

1950
01:27:46.688 --> 01:27:49.189
- No baby. I'm all right.

1951
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:51.189
I'm all right. I'm okay.

1952
01:27:55.896 --> 01:27:57.608
Some days is better than others.

1953
01:27:57.608 --> 01:28:00.691
but hey. as long as I keep waking up.

1954
01:28:04.324 --> 01:28:07.279
God will keep blessing me.

1955
01:28:07.279 --> 01:28:09.647
- And that's what's important.

1956
01:28:09.647 --> 01:28:10.480

01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.824
But how are you?

because I see that look in your eyes.

1961
01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:31.026
- You know. some days
better than others. auntie.

1962
01:28:31.026 --> 01:28:32.604
I ain't gon lie to you.

1963
01:28:32.604 --> 01:28:35.212
Life might be pulling on
me in every direction.

1964
01:28:35.212 --> 01:28:39.024
I don't know if I'm coming
and going some days.

1965
01:28:39.024 --> 01:28:40.274
- I understand.

1966
01:28:42.096 --> 01:28:44.763
Baby. let me tell you this much.

1967
01:28:46.088 --> 01:28:49.852
You're a good person with a pure heart.

1968
01:28:49.852 --> 01:28:52.072
And I am so proud.

1969
01:28:52.072 --> 01:28:56.048
So proud of the man that you have become.

1970
01:28:56.048 --> 01:28:57.048
- Thank you.

1971
01:28:58.524 --> 01:29:00.040
I'm trying.

1972
01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:01.207
- I know baby.

1973
01:29:02.825 --> 01:29:07.268
You got a lot of potential.
a lot of potential.

1974
01:29:07.268 --> 01:29:10.867
but I don't want you to let
what happened to Nicholas

1975
01:29:10.867 --> 01:29:14.034
digress you from what God has for you.

1976
01:29:16.496 --> 01:29:18.552
- Auntie. I'm not (indistinct).

1977
01:29:18.552 --> 01:29:20.302
- No. I'm not stupid.

1978
01:29:22.288 --> 01:29:25.705
I see you falling back into your old ways

1979
01:29:26.678 --> 01:29:29.320
and that's not what I want for you.

1980
01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:32.832
And that's not what your
mother would have want for you.

1981
01:29:32.832 --> 01:29:37.588
So please think about whatever
it is that you are doing

1982
01:29:37.588 --> 01:29:41.140
because God knows I can't take it

1983
01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:43.557
if something happened to you.

1984
01:29:44.788 --> 01:29:45.788
You hear me?

1985
01:29:47.485 --> 01:29:48.700
- I got you. auntie.

1986
01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:52.108
But you ain't gotta
worry about me. I'm good.

1987
01:29:52.108 --> 01:29:54.525
- You make sure of that. boy.

1988

2048

- I wasn't feeling too good.

2056
01:34:33.605 --> 01:34:35.453
I think it's something I ate.

2057
01:34:35.453 --> 01:34:36.605
- Do you need me to bring you something?

2058
01:34:36.605 --> 01:34:37.777
You all right?

2059
01:34:37.777 --> 01:34:38.901
- No. I'm good.

2060
01:34:38.901 --> 01:34:40.474
I'm just gonna lay down

- Yo. how many more stops we got?

2064
01:35:00.738 --> 01:35:02.585
- I just got to go around
the way and grab some money

2065
01:35:02.585 --> 01:35:04.297
before we shoot to the forest.

2066
01:35:04.297 --> 01:35:05.541
- What's in the forest.

2067
01:35:05.541 --> 01:35:06.829

She ain't filling too good.

2072
01:35:15.295 --> 01:35:18.247
Plus I need to snatch something
from over there anyway.

2073
01:35:18.247 --> 01:35:20.887

01:38:02.107 --> 01:38:03.579
This needs his ass kicked.

2157
01:38:03.579 --> 01:38:04.943
I'm tired of him thinking he can do

2158
01:38:04.943 --> 01:38:06.323
whatever he wants to you.

2159
01:38:06.323 --> 01:38:08.351
- It's all right Kim. it's all right.

2160
01:38:08.351 --> 01:38:09.184

01:38:17.049 --> 01:38:18.715
- What you want me to do. Kim.

2167
01:38:18.715 --> 01:38:20.803
- Call the fucking police.

2168
01:38:20.803 --> 01:38:22.841
- You know I can't do that.

2169
01:38:22.841 --> 01:38:24.843
Valentine got all types of connections.

2170
01:38:24.843 --> 01:38:26.987
I don't have nobody to protect me.

2171
01:38:26.987 --> 01:38:29.179
If I even threatened to go to the police.

2172
01:38:29.179 --> 01:38:30.739

2173
01:38:30.739 --> 01:38:33.079

01:38:33.079 --> 01:38:34.996
- Let it go. let it go.

2175
01:38:35.839 --> 01:38:37.338
I'm not letting shit go.

2176
01:38:37.338 --> 01:38:39.388
I don't care how much money he has.

2177
01:38:39.388 --> 01:38:41.703
What type of connections he's got.

2178
01:38:41.703 --> 01:38:45.211
you can't let them get
away with abusing you.

2179
01:38:45.211 --> 01:38:49.128
Yo Bree. if you don't
value yourself. who will?

2180
01:38:50.251 --> 01:38:51.827
- Yo. I shouldn't have provoked the nigga

2181
01:38:51.827 --> 01:38:53.103
in the first place.

2182
01:38:53.103 --> 01:38:55.331
Kim. like I knew he was gonna flip out

2183
01:38:55.331 --> 01:38:56.851
and act crazy like I should not.

2184
01:38:56.851 --> 01:38:58.451
- No. Bree. I'm not
gonna let you sit up here

2185
01:38:58.451 --> 01:38:59.771
and blame yourself.

2186
01:38:59.771 --> 01:39:02.807
You're beautiful with so much potential.

2187
01:39:02.807 --> 01:39:05.071
Bitch. I need you to recognize that.

2188
01:39:05.071 --> 01:39:07.934
So what if you acknowledged
Hunter and gave him a hug.

2189
01:39:07.934 --> 01:39:10.921
Man. that nigga ain't got no rights.

2190
01:39:10.921 --> 01:39:12.838
- No rights what. what?

2191
01:39:14.607 --> 01:39:18.723
- Bitch. what if you told
Hunter what that nigga did?

2192
01:39:18.723 --> 01:39:20.851
- Yeah. Hunter is not gonna
do nothing to Valentine.

2193
01:39:20.851 --> 01:39:22.891
Them niggas is like
brothers. you know that.

2194
01:39:22.891 --> 01:39:23.987
- Exactly.

2195
01:39:23.987 --> 01:39:27.887
- The disrespect. the disloyalty
of him sleeping with you

2196
01:39:27.887 --> 01:39:31.667
when Hunter was in prison is
enough to make that nigga snap.

2197
01:39:31.667 --> 01:39:34.515
And when he find out that
bitch ass nigga raped you.

2198
01:39:34.515 --> 01:39:36.765
he gonn' flip the fuck out.

2199
01:39:37.995 --> 01:39:39.123
- You think so?

2200
01:39:39.123 --> 01:39:40.456
- Yo. I know so.

2201
01:39:43.443 --> 01:39:45.659
- You know what. shit.

2202
01:39:45.659 --> 01:39:47.131
Valentine was the one that was telling me

2203
01:39:47.131 --> 01:39:48.884
that Hunter was cheating and shit

2204
01:39:48.884 --> 01:39:51.555
with the bitches in the first place.

2205
01:39:51.555 --> 01:39:52.515
- See. perfect.

2206
01:39:52.515 --> 01:39:54.932
Use all that against his ass.

2207
01:39:56.207 --> 01:39:58.023
- You know what. you're right.

2208
01:39:58.023 --> 01:40:00.903
And then maybe Hunter will
understand the position

2209
01:40:00.903 --> 01:40:04.487
that that nigga. Valentine
put me in in the first place.

2210
01:40:04.487 --> 01:40:07.904
I really didn't think about it like that.

2211
01:40:09.519 --> 01:40:12.602
(instrumental music)

2212
01:40:17.347 --> 01:40:18.771
- What did I do now.

2213
01:40:18.771 --> 01:40:20.148
- You didn't do anything.

2214
01:40:20.148 --> 01:40:21.966
- So what we need to talk about?

2215
01:40:21.966 --> 01:40:23.991
- Baby. we need to talk about us.

2216
01:40:23.991 --> 01:40:26.389
the plans for our relationship.

2217
01:40:26.389 --> 01:40:28.418
I can't just sit and wait on you

2218
01:40:28.418 --> 01:40:30.143
to get your life together. baby.

2219
01:40:30.143 --> 01:40:32.631
- Hey. we already talked about this.

2220
01:40:32.631 --> 01:40:34.899
Ain't nothing to mention
them all right now.

2221
01:40:34.899 --> 01:40:35.732
So don't do that.

2222
01:40:35.732 --> 01:40:37.327
- Well. that's not working for me.

2223
01:40:37.327 --> 01:40:41.139
I need stability and
you all over the place.

2224
01:40:41.139 --> 01:40:42.440
- What do you want me to do?

2225
01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.703
- I want you to make a choice.

2226
01:40:43.703 --> 01:40:44.627
- Between what?

2227
01:40:44.627 --> 01:40:48.307
- Oh. I need to spell it out for you.

2228
01:40:48.307 --> 01:40:52.043
- Babe. I've been in the
streets working my ass off

2229
01:40:52.043 --> 01:40:54.803
trying to get my life back together

2230
01:40:54.803 --> 01:40:56.543
and you already know what
I've been going through.

2231
01:40:56.543 --> 01:40:57.863
Everything that happened to Nick.

2232
01:40:57.863 --> 01:40:59.603
- I don't wanna hear you say anything

2233
01:40:59.603 --> 01:41:01.371
about what happened with Nick.

2234
01:41:01.371 --> 01:41:03.771
You wanna keep using that shit
as an excuse to go back out

2235
01:41:03.771 --> 01:41:06.351
into these streets with this stupid shit.

2236
01:41:06.351 --> 01:41:07.959
Instead of standing up and being a man.

2237
01:41:07.959 --> 01:41:09.590
you being a coward.

2238
01:41:09.590 --> 01:41:10.423
- Coward.

2239
01:41:10.423 --> 01:41:11.439
- Yes. a coward.

2240
01:41:11.439 --> 01:41:12.503
- I ain't no motherfucking coward.

2241
01:41:12.503 --> 01:41:13.539
- You are a fucking coward.

2242
01:41:13.539 --> 01:41:15.981
You care so much about
what everybody else think.

2243
01:41:15.981 --> 01:41:18.923
These streets don't give a fuck about you.

2244
01:41:18.923 --> 01:41:22.006
- The streets. the people. the hustle

2245
01:41:23.030 --> 01:41:24.351
is just who I am. baby.

2246
01:41:24.351 --> 01:41:27.291
- So what about me. what about us?

2247
01:41:27.291 --> 01:41:28.687
- What do you want me to do?

2248
01:41:28.687 --> 01:41:29.691
- I can't do this.

2249
01:41:29.691 --> 01:41:30.524
- You can't do what?

2250
01:41:30.524 --> 01:41:31.956
- I can't do this.

2251
01:41:31.956 --> 01:41:33.159
- You can't do what?

2252
01:41:33.159 --> 01:41:35.076
- I'm pregnant. Hunter.

2253
01:41:35.991 --> 01:41:37.074
I'm pregnant.

2254
01:41:38.562 --> 01:41:40.312
Yeah. with your baby.

2255
01:41:42.806 --> 01:41:46.842
And I'll be damned if I have
a child without a father.

2256
01:41:46.842 --> 01:41:49.362
You're not doing this to me.

2257
01:41:49.362 --> 01:41:50.195
- You sure?

2258
01:41:50.195 --> 01:41:51.445
- I'm positive.

2259
01:41:53.199 --> 01:41:57.032
That's why you need to
get your shit together.

2260
01:41:58.150 --> 01:42:01.405
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

2261
01:42:01.405 --> 01:42:02.814
I'm not playing. babe.

2262
01:42:02.814 --> 01:42:04.070
- Come here. come here.

2263
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:06.086
- You can't do this to me.

2264
01:42:06.086 --> 01:42:08.086
You can't do this to me.

2265
01:42:12.907 --> 01:42:15.574
- Hold on. let me call you back.

2266
01:42:17.126 --> 01:42:18.190
Hey yo. so what's up.

2267

But this nigga. this nigga

which happened to be his
right-hand man. Hunter.

Like first of all. let
me just say that. okay.

2317
01:44:34.190 --> 01:44:37.357
But after you got locked up and went away.

2318
01:44:37.357 --> 01:44:39.607
I felt confused and lonely.

2319
01:44:41.616 --> 01:44:43.970
- Bree. we already traveled this road.

2320
01:44:43.970 --> 01:44:45.398
We ain't gotta even go there again.

We good.

2322
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:50.217
- I know. but I feel
like I need to tell you

2323
01:44:51.550 --> 01:44:54.067
the reason why I did what I did.

2324
01:44:54.067 --> 01:44:55.046
- Okay.

2325
01:44:55.046 --> 01:44:56.470
- But I need you to promise me

2326
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:59.110
that you're not gon to
flip out and act crazy.

2327
01:44:59.110 --> 01:45:01.674
- Say what you got to say. Bree.

2328
01:45:01.674 --> 01:45:02.507
- Okay.

2329
01:45:06.474 --> 01:45:10.166
Well. when you first got
locked up and went away.

2330
01:45:10.166 --> 01:45:13.134
your man Valentine. he would. you know.

2331
01:45:13.134 --> 01:45:17.670
he would come by. give me
money. make sure I was okay.

2332
01:45:17.670 --> 01:45:19.154
- Okay. that's what he's supposed to do.

2333
01:45:19.154 --> 01:45:20.622
- I know. right.

2334
01:45:20.622 --> 01:45:23.294
But he started to come over
maybe a little bit more

2335
01:45:23.294 --> 01:45:24.718
than he should have.

2336
01:45:24.718 --> 01:45:27.870
- What do you mean more
than he should have?

2337
01:45:27.870 --> 01:45:31.787
- Well. he would pop up
late night unannounced.

2338
01:45:34.662 --> 01:45:39.014
telling me how beautiful I
was. how I deserved better.

2339
01:45:39.014 --> 01:45:42.662
And at first I won't entertain it.

2340
01:45:42.662 --> 01:45:45.119
but he started to tell
me about all the bitches

2341
01:45:45.119 --> 01:45:47.286
that you was fucking with.

2342
01:45:48.182 --> 01:45:52.646
And at that point I felt
lonely and betrayed and shit.

2343
01:45:52.646 --> 01:45:56.018
I thought he was just trying to help me.

2344
01:45:56.018 --> 01:45:58.586
- So if you're tryina

01:46:15.158 --> 01:46:17.857
Everything I did for you.
I sacrificed for you.

2353
01:46:17.857 --> 01:46:19.056
- It wasn't about you. what about me?

2354
01:46:19.056 --> 01:46:19.889
- What about you?

2355
01:46:19.889 --> 01:46:21.518

- Yo. he raped me. he came to my house.
