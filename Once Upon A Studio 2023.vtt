{\an8} It's so incredible to think

4
00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:18.875
{\an8}that Walt started Disney Animation
100 years ago today.

5
00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:24.041
To think of all those talented artists
and wonderful characters

6
00:00:24.041 --> 00:00:27.166
who have been a part of the studio
over the years.

7
00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:28.250
Yep.

8
00:00:31.416 --> 00:00:33.416
If these walls could talk.

9
00:00:53.916 --> 00:00:56.708
Psst! Tink. Tinker Bell. You there?

10
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.416
Is that it? They all gone?

11
00:01:02.541 --> 00:01:03.750

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.416
Let's get the gang!

14
00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:10.583

100-year group photo.

19
00:01:16.958 --> 00:01:18.333

20
00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.708
Come on. Let's hop to it!

21
00:01:19.708 --> 00:01:21.166
