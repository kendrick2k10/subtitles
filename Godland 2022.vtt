3
00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.217
I've found a guide who can
take you safely to your destination.

4
00:01:03.337 --> 00:01:05.301
He's local.

5
00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:08.969
and they say people from there
have centuries of experience

6
00:01:09.089 --> 00:01:12.301
with the weather. rivers.
and glaciers.

7
00:01:12.421 --> 00:01:15.261
Will he require payment?
- Will he what?

8
00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:18.217
Will he require payment?
- Yes. yes.

9
00:01:18.337 --> 00:01:20.217
But you will have need for
his knowledge.

10
00:01:20.337 --> 00:01:25.217
He's a good worker too.
he can help build the church.

11
00:01:25.337 --> 00:01:27.337
As you wish.

12
00:01:28.173 --> 00:01:30.173
Lucas... I must remind you...

13
00:01:31.213 --> 00:01:32.385
or...

14
00:01:32.505 --> 00:01:34.969
The island is very different
from Denmark.

15
00:01:35.089 --> 00:01:37.089
People there...

16
00:01:37.673 --> 00:01:41.626
the weather. the winter.
everything is completely different.

17
00:01:42.881 --> 00:01:46.385
What I mean to say... it is of
paramount importance that

18
00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:50.713
the church is built and ready
before winter arrives.

19
00:01:53.921 --> 00:01:55.761
This is understood. yes?

20
00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:58.845
The church will be ready
before the first snow.

21
00:01:58.965 --> 00:02:00.801
Many are moving from the east coast

22
00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:03.717
because of the volcano that erupted.

23
00:02:03.837 --> 00:02:05.509
Will this impact my journey?

24
00:02:05.629 --> 00:02:11.553
No. Well. you probably won't pass
near the volcano. but it'll be more

25
00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:16.881
difficult to read the rivers.
they can rise more than usual.

26
00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:23.509
They say the volcano emits a stench.
a smell so foul. it's as if

27
00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.885
the Earth has shat its pants.

28
00:02:27.005 --> 00:02:32.009
The smell can be so overwhelming
that people lose their minds.

29
00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:33.717
That's easy to do up there.

30
00:02:33.837 --> 00:02:38.381
It's summer now.
so it's bright both day and night.

31
00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:43.509
This can be exhausting for people
who've never been there before.

32
00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:47.761
They can literally forget to sleep.

33
00:02:47.881 --> 00:02:49.881
My interpreter has warned me.

34
00:02:53.837 --> 00:02:55.553
When I look at your face

35
00:02:55.673 --> 00:02:58.929
it reminds me of myself
thirty years ago.

36
00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.381
A slightly healthier version...

37
00:03:03.837 --> 00:03:05.837
Lucas...

38
00:03:06.257 --> 00:03:11.009
you must adapt to the circumstances
of the country and its people.

39
00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.089
Otherwise.
your task will come to nothing.

40
00:03:15.505 --> 00:03:20.217
I'm well aware that at times
your task will seem... monumental.

41
00:03:20.337 --> 00:03:26.177
And it's true. it is. and no one
claims that it will be an easy one.

42
00:03:26.297 --> 00:03:29.093
This is why you were chosen.

43
00:03:29.213 --> 00:03:32.969
But forget all that
and think about the apostles.

44
00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:36.053
sent to preach to the world.

45
00:03:36.173 --> 00:03:38.717
The whole world and everyone in it.

46
00:03:38.837 --> 00:03:43.089
This wretched. miserable. pathetic
flock of lonely men.

47
00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:49.469
But they did it. Which means
that no task is impossible.

48
00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:53.089
And therefore.
your task is not impossible.

49
00:03:55.337 --> 00:04:01.129
GODLAND (in Danish)

50
00:04:05.757 --> 00:04:08.137
A wooden box was found in Iceland.

51
00:04:08.257 --> 00:04:12.593
with seven wet plate photographs
taken by a Danish priest.

52
00:04:12.713 --> 00:04:20.301
These images are the very first
photos of the southeast coast.

53
00:04:20.421 --> 00:04:27.005
This film is inspired
by these photographs.

54
00:05:35.257 --> 00:05:37.801
It's important that they
stare straight in the eye.

55
00:05:37.921 --> 00:05:41.405
<i>He says it's important
to look directly into the eye.</i>

56
00:05:45.465 --> 00:05:47.713
Remember. you must stand still...

57
00:05:48.213 --> 00:05:50.421
<i>You're not supposed to move.</i>

58
00:05:50.837 --> 00:05:53.337
<i>Completely still.
- Dead still!</i>

59
00:05:54.881 --> 00:05:56.801
As if you're dead.

60
00:05:56.921 --> 00:05:58.921
<i>Just. as if you're dead.</i>

61
00:06:00.049 --> 00:06:02.049
Shush...

62
00:06:06.297 --> 00:06:10.177
One. two. three.

63
00:06:10.297 --> 00:06:13.257
four. five. six.

64
00:06:15.213 --> 00:06:21.421
<i>GODLAND (in Icelandic)</i>

65
00:06:44.257 --> 00:06:46.602
Remember the letters and the books.

66
00:06:49.005 --> 00:06:51.129
How do you say books?

67
00:06:51.713 --> 00:06:56.801
<i>Bók. singular... bækur. plural.</i>

68
00:06:56.921 --> 00:06:59.629
<i>Bók... bækur.</i>

69
00:07:00.173 --> 00:07:02.629
Like a native.
- Shut your mouth!

70
00:07:04.297 --> 00:07:06.469
And how do you say that?
- What?

71
00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:08.385
Shut your mouth.

72
00:07:08.505 --> 00:07:11.093
There are many ways to say
shut your mouth in Icelandic.

73
00:07:11.213 --> 00:07:14.764
just like there are many ways
to describe bad weather.

74
00:07:20.049 --> 00:07:22.049
<i>Rigning.</i>

75
00:07:24.421 --> 00:07:26.421
<i>Rigning.</i>

76
00:07:28.465 --> 00:07:30.465
<i>Suddi.</i>

77
00:07:31.505 --> 00:07:33.505
<i>Suddi.</i>

78
00:07:34.465 --> 00:07:36.465

<i>Úrkoma.</i>

80
00:07:39.673 --> 00:07:41.673
<i>Úði.</i>

81
00:07:42.173 --> 00:07:43.301
<i>Úði.</i>

82
00:07:43.421 --> 00:07:45.421
<i>Vatnsveður.</i>

83
00:07:46.173 --> 00:07:48.652
I can't... I can't remember them all.

84
00:07:50.173 --> 00:07:52.385
<i>Úrhellisrigning.</i>

85
00:07:52.505 --> 00:07:53.469
Pass.

86
00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:55.593
<i>Demba. skúr...</i>

87
00:07:55.713 --> 00:07:58.381
<i>That's... that's enough.
- Slepja...</i>

88
00:07:59.837 --> 00:08:01.837
<i>Úrhelli.
- Stop.</i>

89
00:08:02.337 --> 00:08:06.137
<i>Votviðri. væta. hrakviðri.</i>

90
00:08:06.257 --> 00:08:09.129
And all of those words mean rain?
- Yes.

91
00:08:10.257 --> 00:08:12.381
Make up your minds.

92
00:08:28.757 --> 00:08:30.757
<i>Rigning...</i>

93
00:08:31.505 --> 00:08:33.505
<i>Rigning... (rain)</i>

94
00:08:36.505 --> 00:08:38.385
<i>Bátur... (boat)</i>

95
00:08:38.505 --> 00:08:40.505
<i>Bátur. (boat)
- Yeah.</i>

96
00:08:45.049 --> 00:08:47.049
<i>Prestur. (priest)</i>

97
00:08:51.757 --> 00:08:53.757
<i>Maður. (man)</i>

98
00:08:55.257 --> 00:08:58.421
<i>Maður og prestur. (man and priest)</i>

99
00:11:17.337 --> 00:11:19.217
<i>Who is going to read all these books?</i>

100
00:11:19.337 --> 00:11:21.337
<i>The priest.</i>

101
00:11:39.005 --> 00:11:41.297
<i>Damn nonsense...</i>

102
00:11:43.549 --> 00:11:45.757
<i>How heavy is it?</i>

103
00:11:48.089 --> 00:11:50.549
<i>We'll work it out.</i>

104
00:11:50.921 --> 00:11:54.177
<i>It'll slow us down.
We can distribute the weight.</i>

105
00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:55.969
<i>Saw it in half.</i>

106
00:11:56.089 --> 00:11:58.717
<i>Saw what?
- Saw the cross in half!</i>

107
00:11:58.837 --> 00:12:01.469
<i>We don't have a saw.</i>

108
00:12:01.589 --> 00:12:08.297
<i>Let's ride and let's ride hard.
into the woods...</i>

109
00:12:10.757 --> 00:12:13.797
<i>long is the journey...</i>

110
00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:16.717
Are you Ragnar?

111
00:12:16.837 --> 00:12:23.217
<i>The foals are lazy.
I've lost my knife.</i>

112
00:12:23.337 --> 00:12:25.593
<i>lost my shoe...</i>

113
00:12:25.713 --> 00:12:27.797
Do you speak Danish?

114
00:12:32.337 --> 00:12:38.969
Ride. ride in a row!
The horse's name is Planke!

115
00:12:39.089 --> 00:12:45.257
The foal's name is Abildgrá
and Ole will ride it.

116
00:12:46.505 --> 00:12:52.257
Where is he riding?
To the royal court

117
00:12:53.049 --> 00:12:58.505
to woo his fiancée.
Tania is her name.

118
00:12:59.465 --> 00:13:01.717
I'm Lucas.

119
00:13:01.837 --> 00:13:03.837
The priest.

120
00:13:04.005 --> 00:13:06.213
<i>A Danish devil.</i>

121
00:13:11.757 --> 00:13:13.009
You have a horse?

122
00:13:13.129 --> 00:13:16.337
Yes. many. Many horses.

123
00:13:17.257 --> 00:13:19.429
You have a horse for me?

124
00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:21.713
<i>This is your horse.</i>

125
00:13:23.465 --> 00:13:25.465
<i>a fine horse.</i>

126
00:13:26.505 --> 00:13:28.505
Up!

127
00:13:28.797 --> 00:13:29.929
Now?
- Yes.

128
00:13:30.049 --> 00:13:31.385
We're leaving right now?

129
00:13:31.505 --> 00:13:33.505
Up!

130
00:13:38.757 --> 00:13:40.757
<i>Open the gate.</i>

131
00:13:42.881 --> 00:13:44.177

00:13:44.297 --> 00:13:47.213
<i>Torsk. Þorskur.</i>

133
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:49.629
Cod?

134
00:13:50.505 --> 00:13:52.505
Like a fish?

135
00:13:56.549 --> 00:13:58.093
<i>Pull evenly on the harness!</i>

136
00:13:58.213 --> 00:14:00.213
What?

137
00:14:01.505 --> 00:14:03.505
Easy.

138
00:14:06.965 --> 00:14:08.677
<i>Don't be so rough on him.</i>

139
00:14:08.797 --> 00:14:10.797
What?

140
00:14:13.589 --> 00:14:16.005
<i>Easy.
- No. no. no. no.</i>

141
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:18.629
<i>Get off.</i>

142
00:14:21.257 --> 00:14:23.257
<i>Get off!</i>

143
00:14:27.005 --> 00:14:30.129
<i>Look at this. Still. still!</i>

144
00:14:35.421 --> 00:14:37.421
<i>Look!</i>

145
00:14:40.797 --> 00:14:45.089
<i>Like this. slow and easy. Look!</i>

146
00:14:49.505 --> 00:14:51.629
<i>Can you see how I do it?</i>

147
00:14:54.173 --> 00:14:58.465
<i>Up. like this. Friðrik!</i>

148
00:15:05.213 --> 00:15:07.713
<i>Don't ruin a perfectly good horse.</i>

149
00:18:09.381 --> 00:18:11.505
<i>Dog!</i>

150
00:19:51.629 --> 00:19:54.443
<i>Then we drag in the catch
tomorrow morning.</i>

151
00:19:59.297 --> 00:20:02.379
Ragnar. I don't understand
what you are saying.

152
00:20:09.757 --> 00:20:12.337
<i>Good night. priest.</i>

153
00:21:20.337 --> 00:21:22.969
<i>Do you want to play?
Want to play? Yeah.</i>

154
00:21:23.089 --> 00:21:25.089
<i>Want to play?</i>

155
00:23:40.213 --> 00:23:43.429
<i>And how is the pasture
before the sands?</i>

156
00:23:43.549 --> 00:23:45.589
<i>There's plenty to bite.</i>

157
00:23:46.337 --> 00:23:52.345
<i>Then I'll take three. and one sheep.
that should do it.</i>

158
00:23:52.465 --> 00:23:55.385
<i>You won't get the horses.</i>

159
00:23:55.505 --> 00:23:58.177
<i>The horses...
Why would I want the horses?</i>

160
00:23:58.297 --> 00:23:59.845
<i>You won't get them.</i>

161
00:23:59.965 --> 00:24:02.717
<i>I don't want your horses.
we have plenty of horses.</i>

162
00:24:02.837 --> 00:24:04.345
<i>Good. cause you won't get them.</i>

163
00:24:04.465 --> 00:24:07.637
<i>Good. Has your father
lost his senses?</i>

164
00:24:07.757 --> 00:24:09.345
<i>Yes.</i>

165
00:24:09.465 --> 00:24:11.465
<i>Pay the man.</i>

166
00:24:15.505 --> 00:24:17.761
You are supposed to pay.

167
00:24:17.881 --> 00:24:19.009
For what?

168
00:24:19.129 --> 00:24:21.677
Grass for the horses.

169
00:24:21.797 --> 00:24:25.717
There will be no pastures
when we go across the sand.

170
00:24:25.837 --> 00:24:28.297
<i>You look miserable.</i>

171
00:24:36.297 --> 00:24:44.297
<i>Uncrossable seems the river today...</i>

172
00:24:46.713 --> 00:24:53.713
<i>The current is worst of all.</i>

173
00:24:56.381 --> 00:25:04.381
<i>With large icebergs floating around.</i>

174
00:25:05.465 --> 00:25:13.465
<i>no horse will walk through it...</i>

175
00:25:27.381 --> 00:25:29.381
<i>A bit more.</i>

176
00:25:44.465 --> 00:25:47.505
<i>It's on both sides. but never mind.</i>

177
00:25:48.129 --> 00:25:49.261
<i>Now we lift it.</i>

178
00:25:49.381 --> 00:25:51.505
<i>Up with the animal!</i>

179
00:26:15.213 --> 00:26:17.421
<i>Where are you going?</i>

180
00:26:18.881 --> 00:26:20.885
Where are we going?

181
00:26:21.005 --> 00:26:22.593
Off to find a picture.

182
00:26:22.713 --> 00:26:24.965
<i>To find a picture.</i>

183
00:27:22.129 --> 00:27:25.969
<i>I'm not sure if I'm allowed
to tell this story.</i>

184
00:27:26.089 --> 00:27:31.089
<i>but here it goes anyway.</i>

185
00:27:32.965 --> 00:27:37.261
<i>I don't remember exactly
how many years ago this happened.</i>

186
00:27:37.381 --> 00:27:39.929
<i>but the man in the story</i>

187
00:27:40.049 --> 00:27:44.757
<i>is still alive...
and he's not that old.</i>

188
00:27:47.129 --> 00:27:53.137
<i>He had been traveling
around these parts for over a day</i>

189
00:27:53.257 --> 00:27:56.337
<i>before finally finding
a place to rest.</i>

190
00:27:58.005 --> 00:28:03.713
<i>But during the night he woke up
because his horse was uneasy.</i>

191
00:28:05.757 --> 00:28:11.089
<i>It was a bright night. like now.
and the horse couldn't stay still.</i>

192
00:28:15.257 --> 00:28:20.637
<i>The man tried to calm the horse down.
it was a wise horse.</i>

193
00:28:20.757 --> 00:28:25.837
<i>it had never acted like this before
so the man was becoming uneasy.</i>

194
00:28:30.421 --> 00:28:34.969
<i>When the horse finally
calmed down.</i>

195
00:28:35.089 --> 00:28:40.137
<i>the man heard something moving
in the grass by the riverbank</i>

196
00:28:40.257 --> 00:28:45.837
<i>and was very startled when he looked
into the water. filled with eels.</i>

197
00:28:48.257 --> 00:28:53.137
<i>The eels were crawling over
each other in the slimy mud...</i>

198
00:28:53.257 --> 00:28:54.637
<i>Do eels have teeth?</i>

199
00:28:54.757 --> 00:28:56.757
<i>Shut your mouth!</i>

200
00:28:58.589 --> 00:29:02.345
<i>And the man instantly realized
that he was witnessing</i>

201
00:29:02.465 --> 00:29:08.465
<i>a breeding process that no living man
had ever seen before.</i>

202
00:29:10.757 --> 00:29:15.053
<i>But what the man
found most frightening</i>

203
00:29:15.173 --> 00:29:19.837
<i>was that the eels
emitted peculiar sounds.</i>

204
00:29:21.589 --> 00:29:27.757
<i>A sound that was strangely familiar
to women's sounds of pleasure.</i>

205
00:29:31.421 --> 00:29:36.801
<i>This was a brave man.
not afraid of anything.</i>

206
00:29:36.921 --> 00:29:41.593
<i>so he went back to rest
close to the water</i>

207
00:29:41.713 --> 00:29:47.005
<i>and quickly fell into a deep sleep.
exhausted after a long journey.</i>

208
00:29:47.797 --> 00:29:51.549
<i>But when he woke up.
he didn't feel very well.</i>

209
00:29:52.549 --> 00:29:54.757
<i>He was dripping with sweat</i>

210
00:29:56.213 --> 00:29:58.213
<i>and drained.</i>

211
00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:02.093
<i>He could sense
that something was wrong</i>

212
00:30:02.213 --> 00:30:05.553
<i>so he grabbed the largest stone
he could find</i>

213
00:30:05.673 --> 00:30:10.673
<i>and stormed towards the water
and threw it fiercely into it.</i>

214
00:30:12.297 --> 00:30:18.213
<i>And when the water settled.
not a single eel could be seen.</i>

215
00:30:21.505 --> 00:30:25.965
<i>He rode off in such a hurry</i>

216
00:30:27.129 --> 00:30:30.211
<i>that he forgot the saddlebag
with all the food.</i>

217
00:30:31.965 --> 00:30:33.553
<i>When he had traveled
for a while.</i>

218
00:30:33.673 --> 00:30:38.717
<i>he began to remember
what he dreamt that night.</i>

219
00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:42.337
<i>It was hard for him to describe
his dream.</i>

220
00:30:44.297 --> 00:30:46.921
<i>but this is what he told me.</i>

221
00:30:49.213 --> 00:30:53.885
<i>He dreamt he was
approaching his farm;</i>

222
00:30:54.005 --> 00:30:59.385
<i>it was illuminated with oil lamps.</i>

223
00:30:59.505 --> 00:31:02.505
<i>a thick smoke was hanging
over the farmhouse.</i>

224
00:31:04.465 --> 00:31:10.801
<i>He got off his horse and entered the
house and into a thick wall of steam</i>

225
00:31:10.921 --> 00:31:17.381
<i>and saw the house was full of
naked men from neighboring farms.</i>

226
00:31:19.421 --> 00:31:23.837
<i>He knew their faces
but couldn't speak.</i>

227
00:31:25.965 --> 00:31:29.969
<i>Then he began losing all strength
in his legs</i>

228
00:31:30.089 --> 00:31:33.089
<i>and slumped to the floor.</i>

229
00:31:34.797 --> 00:31:38.505
<i>No one came to help.
they didn't even look at him.</i>

230
00:31:41.465 --> 00:31:45.885
<i>Then he began hearing a
strangely familiar sound</i>

231
00:31:46.005 --> 00:31:50.137
<i>and when he looked further
into the house he saw his wife</i>

232
00:31:50.257 --> 00:31:52.797
<i>lying under another man.</i>

233
00:31:54.757 --> 00:31:59.049
<i>He watched as men took turns
on his wife.</i>

234
00:32:01.965 --> 00:32:07.881
<i>while she moaned like
the eels in the mud.</i>

235
00:32:10.797 --> 00:32:16.797
<i>He couldn't move a muscle.
couldn't breathe a word.</i>

236
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:25.089
<i>At this point in the story
the man was tearful.</i>

237
00:32:26.005 --> 00:32:28.093
<i>saying that he had to
witness this horror</i>

238
00:32:28.213 --> 00:32:32.337
<i>for what seemed to be
an eternity.</i>

239
00:32:38.505 --> 00:32:40.677
<i>After this terrible nightmare</i>

240
00:32:40.797 --> 00:32:45.049
<i>he couldn't face
a single man in the region.</i>

241
00:32:47.213 --> 00:32:50.921
<i>He even had trouble
being intimate with his wife.</i>

242
00:32:56.337 --> 00:32:59.381
<i>But each and every year
after this event.</i>

243
00:33:00.757 --> 00:33:05.469
<i>he searched out every single
marsh and pond in the region</i>

244
00:33:05.589 --> 00:33:11.965
<i>and ripped apart and shred to pieces
every single dirty eel he could find.</i>

245
00:34:01.213 --> 00:34:03.345
Can we cross the river?

246
00:34:03.465 --> 00:34:05.629
<i>It's deeper than I thought.</i>

247
00:34:06.257 --> 00:34:07.801
What does that mean?

248
00:34:07.921 --> 00:34:11.297
<i>Deep. It's very deep today.</i>

249
00:34:12.005 --> 00:34:14.089
But can we cross the river?

250
00:34:15.005 --> 00:34:17.005
<i>Don't know.</i>

251
00:34:18.173 --> 00:34:20.173
You don't know?

252
00:34:23.549 --> 00:34:25.301
What do we do then?

253
00:34:25.421 --> 00:34:29.469
<i>If we can't cross the river here.
we can't cross it anywhere.</i>

254
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:32.053
<i>All other spots are uncrossable.</i>

255
00:34:32.173 --> 00:34:36.059
If we can't cross the river here.
we can't cross it at all.

256
00:34:39.673 --> 00:34:41.717
Then we'll cross here.
We'll do it now.

257
00:34:41.837 --> 00:34:45.469
<i>Or we go back for a day
to find pastures</i>

258
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:48.881
<i>and return in two days
to assess the river.</i>

259
00:34:49.713 --> 00:34:54.969
We go back to find pastures
and return in two days.

260
00:34:55.089 --> 00:34:57.053
Two days?

261
00:34:57.173 --> 00:34:59.673
No. we're crossing it now.

262
00:35:00.381 --> 00:35:03.128
Get ready.
We're crossing the river today.

263
00:35:21.549 --> 00:35:23.549
It's just water.

264
00:35:26.297 --> 00:35:30.009
<i>If it falls.
then just try to hold on to him.</i>

265
00:35:30.129 --> 00:35:32.549
<i>It always finds a way to cross.</i>

266
00:36:24.257 --> 00:36:27.797
<i>What?
Wait! No! Help!</i>

267
00:36:29.297 --> 00:36:34.297
Ragnar! Ragnar!
No!

268
00:36:39.837 --> 00:36:41.837
Ragnar!

269
00:36:42.921 --> 00:36:44.921
Ragnar!

270
00:37:17.257 --> 00:37:18.761
I don't know what
God intended for him.

271
00:37:18.881 --> 00:37:22.381
but he must've been
needed elsewhere.

272
00:37:24.921 --> 00:37:28.881
Sometimes. a life must end
so that another can be born.

273
00:37:40.713 --> 00:37:42.713
Rest in peace. my friend.

274
00:39:29.881 --> 00:39:31.885
<i>Where have you been?</i>

275
00:39:32.005 --> 00:39:34.005
<i>Go away.</i>

276
00:41:18.757 --> 00:41:20.757
<i>Keep moving.</i>

277
00:41:26.337 --> 00:41:28.337
<i>Come on. Be determined.</i>

278
00:41:35.421 --> 00:41:37.465
<i>Easy now.
Easy. easy.</i>

279
00:41:38.465 --> 00:41:41.921
<i>Come here! Not that hard.</i>

280
00:41:43.005 --> 00:41:45.465
<i>Relax the reins a bit.</i>

281
00:41:46.589 --> 00:41:48.301
<i>Just come down.</i>

282
00:41:48.421 --> 00:41:50.549
<i>We can come this way up.</i>

283
00:41:53.089 --> 00:41:55.173
<i>Priest. Come down here.</i>

284
00:41:56.129 --> 00:41:57.717
I can't do this anymore. Ragnar.

285
00:41:57.837 --> 00:41:59.837
<i>What are you saying?</i>

286
00:42:02.213 --> 00:42:04.053
<i>Come on. What's going on. priest?</i>

287
00:42:04.173 --> 00:42:07.925
<i>Get your ass down here
and get the horse up on this side.</i>

288
00:42:09.421 --> 00:42:11.549
<i>Snæsa. come and help him.</i>

289
00:42:23.673 --> 00:42:31.673
<i>Where do you come from. waterfall?</i>

290
00:42:33.257 --> 00:42:41.257
<i>Which way do you travel home?</i>

291
00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:51.589
<i>Will you come to us?</i>

292
00:42:53.757 --> 00:43:01.757
<i>Or will you travel with them?</i>

293
00:43:19.257 --> 00:43:22.257
Two. three. four.

294
00:43:23.421 --> 00:43:26.589
five. six. seven.

295
00:43:27.297 --> 00:43:29.465
eight. nine.

296
00:43:36.257 --> 00:43:38.589
Your dog moved less than you.

297
00:43:51.337 --> 00:43:53.381
Goddammit!

298
00:43:59.213 --> 00:44:01.213

301
00:44:40.257 --> 00:44:42.257

What is your secret?

Why don't you talk?

326
00:50:03.965 --> 00:50:08.337
Were you sent from above?
From Habakukk?

327
00:50:09.049 --> 00:50:10.345
Are you the flying horse.

347
00:59:53.049 --> 00:59:55.093
<i>And buried her
under the roots of a tree.</i>

348
00:59:55.213 --> 01:00:00.137
<i>Madam's Honor.
the Fine Madam's Honor.</i>

349
01:00:00.257 --> 01:00:04.929
<i>Off he rode to the farm of Carl.
the animals play in the forest.</i>

350
01:00:05.049 --> 01:00:11.757
<i>At the door stood dear Ida. Madam's
Honor. the Fine Madam's Honor.</i>

351
01:00:12.965 --> 01:00:16.969
<i>Little Ida. come and play.
the animals play in the forest.</i>

352
01:00:17.089 --> 01:00:20.053
<i>I will give you a silken scarf.</i>

353
01:00:20.173 --> 01:00:24.673
<i>Madam's Honor.
the Fine Madam's Honor.</i>

354
01:00:25.257 --> 01:00:29.637
<i>Take it out and show it. please.
the animals play in the forest.</i>

355
01:00:29.757 --> 01:00:32.553
<i>But then she saw
her sister's seams.</i>

356
01:00:32.673 --> 01:00:36.921
<i>Madam's Honor.
the Fine Madam's Honor.</i>

357
01:00:41.505 --> 01:00:45.553
<i>Carl. dear father. rise to your feet.
the animals play in the forest.</i>

358
01:00:45.673 --> 01:00:47.553
<i>Your daughter's killer is at the
door...</i>

359
01:00:47.673 --> 01:00:49.469
<i>What are you singing. girl?</i>

360
01:00:49.589 --> 01:00:51.589
<i>None of your business.</i>

361
01:00:53.005 --> 01:00:54.885
<i>What have you got there?</i>

362
01:00:55.005 --> 01:00:56.217
<i>None of your business.</i>

363
01:00:56.337 --> 01:00:58.217
<i>Ida.</i>

364
01:00:58.337 --> 01:01:00.845
<i>Want to see the house of the Lord?</i>

365
01:01:00.965 --> 01:01:02.965
<i>Yes.</i>

366
01:01:03.921 --> 01:01:05.469
<i>You can also see it.</i>

367
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:07.589
No. thanks.

368
01:01:08.005 --> 01:01:09.969
You don't speak Icelandic?

369
01:01:10.089 --> 01:01:14.505
Yes. a little bit.
But I prefer speaking Danish.

370
01:01:15.921 --> 01:01:17.345
Not for long. Ida.

371
01:01:17.465 --> 01:01:19.465
<i>You are Icelandic?</i>

372
01:01:20.421 --> 01:01:26.801
<i>Well. half of me is Icelandic
and the other half...</i>

373
01:01:26.921 --> 01:01:32.673
<i>Look. if I move my hand like this.
slowly from the right to the left...</i>

374
01:01:33.257 --> 01:01:36.885
<i>just around the middle
I start speaking Danish...</i>

375
01:01:37.005 --> 01:01:41.025
although it's actually from left
to right. not right to left.

376
01:01:41.837 --> 01:01:44.137
I speak Danish too.

377
01:01:44.257 --> 01:01:46.965
Yes. but not very well. right?

378
01:03:39.713 --> 01:03:42.257
Goddammit! I'm sorry!

379
01:03:46.797 --> 01:03:48.797
Should I get my father?

380
01:03:52.837 --> 01:03:55.049
I'll go get my father. I'm sorry.

381
01:04:02.089 --> 01:04:04.089
Father!

382
01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:06.137
Father!

383
01:04:06.257 --> 01:04:08.257
He's awake!

384
01:04:52.089 --> 01:04:54.137
You'll be glad to hear that

385
01:04:54.257 --> 01:04:57.257
the construction of the church
is going well.

386
01:05:01.005 --> 01:05:06.173
If everything goes according to plan.
we'll have a church up before winter.

387
01:05:09.213 --> 01:05:13.629
Ragnar has been most helpful
throughout the process.

388
01:05:14.421 --> 01:05:19.049
We're lucky to have him...
and so are you.

389
01:05:20.257 --> 01:05:24.679
Seeing as he is the one who brought
you here. more dead than alive.

390
01:05:34.549 --> 01:05:38.337
<i>Dammit! I'm sorry...
- Don't worry. it's fine.</i>

391
01:05:39.421 --> 01:05:42.965
There's no punishment
for spilling a glass of wine.

392
01:05:49.337 --> 01:05:52.797
This is what happens
when you invite an Icelander.

393
01:05:53.965 --> 01:05:57.505
They drink your wine
and spill the rest!

394
01:06:09.297 --> 01:06:11.297
<i>I'll do it.</i>

395
01:06:16.837 --> 01:06:20.629
Lucas. you have been very silent.

396
01:06:22.005 --> 01:06:24.005
Do you want to say something?

397
01:06:27.673 --> 01:06:29.673
A prayer. perhaps?

398
01:06:31.713 --> 01:06:34.837
We would be most grateful.

399
01:06:58.673 --> 01:07:04.177
I thank you for your mighty kindness.
from my grateful heart. dear Lord.

400
01:07:04.297 --> 01:07:07.801
And I thank you
for bringing me safely here

401
01:07:07.921 --> 01:07:11.629
to Carl and his two daughters...

402
01:07:13.713 --> 01:07:15.637
Ida.

403
01:07:15.757 --> 01:07:17.553
Ida.

404
01:07:17.673 --> 01:07:19.429
Anna.

405
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:21.549
Ida and Anna.

406
01:07:23.757 --> 01:07:26.437
We thank you
for the food in front of us.

407
01:07:27.549 --> 01:07:30.885
for the friends that surround us.

408
01:07:31.005 --> 01:07:36.217
for the love between us and
for your presence among us.

409
01:07:36.337 --> 01:07:37.885
Amen.

410
01:07:38.005 --> 01:07:39.177
Amen.

411
01:07:39.297 --> 01:07:41.297
Amen.

412
01:07:44.421 --> 01:07:46.421
Thank you.

413
01:07:47.421 --> 01:07:49.969
We are happy to help.

414
01:07:50.089 --> 01:07:55.381
and you are always welcome to visit
or dine with us.

415
01:07:57.757 --> 01:08:00.969
But you have to
leave the house tomorrow.

416
01:08:01.089 --> 01:08:02.845
I cannot have another man
in the house while I

417
01:08:02.965 --> 01:08:05.381
raise my two daughters.

418
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:09.549
You understand. of course.

419
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:14.677
Of course...
- May I ask you a question?

420
01:08:14.797 --> 01:08:20.213
Why the long journey?
When you could have just sailed here.

421
01:08:26.713 --> 01:08:31.885
I wanted to travel.
to see the land and get to know it.

422
01:08:32.005 --> 01:08:35.589
photograph it and its people.

423
01:08:36.797 --> 01:08:41.005
What people?
Were there many on your way?

424
01:08:44.005 --> 01:08:46.005
I don't know.

425
01:08:46.297 --> 01:08:48.297
Who did you meet?

426
01:08:56.257 --> 01:08:59.673
I don't remember.

427
01:09:01.465 --> 01:09:05.797
Of course.
It will come back to you.

428
01:09:10.589 --> 01:09:14.713
So. what do you think
about this unforgiving island?

429
01:09:29.921 --> 01:09:30.885
I'm sorry.

430
01:09:31.005 --> 01:09:33.005
No. no worries.

431
01:09:48.257 --> 01:09:55.469
It's so white out here.

432
01:09:55.589 --> 01:10:03.589
Candlemas whips its knot

433
01:10:05.005 --> 01:10:13.005
so very sharp and hard.

434
01:10:13.257 --> 01:10:21.257
it's white below. it's white above.

435
01:10:22.797 --> 01:10:30.797
in the forest stands a powdered tree.

436
01:10:32.297 --> 01:10:40.297
just like in my orchard.

437
01:10:43.549 --> 01:10:51.549
It's so quiet out here.

438
01:10:52.173 --> 01:11:00.173
with careful knocks on the window

439
01:11:01.673 --> 01:11:09.673
only a great tit sends greetings.

440
01:11:10.837 --> 01:11:18.837
Not a single bird is singing.

441
01:11:20.713 --> 01:11:28.713
the finch just sways on its branch.

442
01:11:30.257 --> 01:11:38.257
looks around and flutters.

443
01:13:23.049 --> 01:13:25.049
Let me.

444
01:13:25.757 --> 01:13:27.757
Thanks.

445
01:13:37.505 --> 01:13:39.505
Do you know God?

446
01:13:39.757 --> 01:13:41.677
Yes.

447
01:13:41.797 --> 01:13:43.881
I'd like to meet him.

448
01:13:44.797 --> 01:13:46.969
You believe in him?

449
01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:50.549
Yes. but I haven't met him
the way you have.

450
01:13:53.505 --> 01:13:55.385
Do you believe in magic?

451
01:13:55.505 --> 01:13:56.969
Yes.

452
01:13:57.089 --> 01:13:59.801
Then you have in fact met God.

453
01:13:59.921 --> 01:14:03.469
but you haven't seen him
because he is a bit like magic.

454
01:14:03.589 --> 01:14:05.921
Do you understand?
- No.

455
01:14:23.713 --> 01:14:25.217
It's heavy.

456
01:14:25.337 --> 01:14:26.469
I'm sorry.

457
01:14:26.589 --> 01:14:29.593
No. it's just a lot
of equipment to carry around.

458
01:14:29.713 --> 01:14:31.429
It's a camera.

459
01:14:31.549 --> 01:14:33.713
Yes. I know that.

460
01:14:35.965 --> 01:14:37.965
Here.

461
01:14:49.505 --> 01:14:51.673
It's very nice here. thank you.

462
01:15:02.505 --> 01:15:04.505
How about this?

463
01:15:05.921 --> 01:15:08.005
No. please sit down.

464
01:15:22.005 --> 01:15:24.005
What about this?

465
01:15:34.337 --> 01:15:36.553
This feels most natural.

466
01:15:36.673 --> 01:15:39.005
Why not just sit normally?

467
01:15:52.257 --> 01:15:54.885
Yes. that's precisely
what I had in mind.

468
01:15:55.005 --> 01:15:58.422
I think father will be very happy
with this picture.

469
01:16:00.421 --> 01:16:03.005
Ida. would you please turn around?

470
01:16:20.673 --> 01:16:23.213
Are you going to marry my sister?

471
01:16:25.505 --> 01:16:27.053
That's an odd question.

472
01:16:27.173 --> 01:16:29.553
There's nothing odd about it.

473
01:16:29.673 --> 01:16:32.717
If that's what you're thinking.
it will never happen.

474
01:16:32.837 --> 01:16:34.801
You don't think she'd marry me?

475
01:16:34.921 --> 01:16:35.929
We are inseparable.

476
01:16:36.049 --> 01:16:39.801
So. if you're marrying my sister.
you're marrying me too.

477
01:16:43.173 --> 01:16:48.337
So. it's all or nothing with you?
Or two for one like a sack of coal?

478
01:17:34.757 --> 01:17:36.767
<i>How can I become a man of God?</i>

479
01:17:40.173 --> 01:17:42.173
What are you saying. Ragnar?

480
01:17:43.757 --> 01:17:48.049
<i>How can I...
become a man of God?</i>

481
01:17:49.673 --> 01:17:51.553
I don't understand.

482
01:17:51.673 --> 01:17:53.673
You don't understand?

483
01:17:55.005 --> 01:17:57.553
<i>You don't understand man of God?
God's man.</i>

484
01:17:57.673 --> 01:17:59.929
God's man?

485
01:18:00.049 --> 01:18:03.965
As in a man of God?
Is that what you're saying?

486
01:18:05.257 --> 01:18:06.553
<i>Ida!</i>

487
01:18:06.673 --> 01:18:08.921
<i>Come and help me.</i>

488
01:18:11.505 --> 01:18:16.337
<i>The Dane doesn't understand me.
you'll have to translate.</i>

489
01:18:17.337 --> 01:18:18.429
What are you writing?

490
01:18:18.549 --> 01:18:19.929
A letter.

491
01:18:20.049 --> 01:18:21.345
To whom?
- A friend...

492
01:18:21.465 --> 01:18:24.965
<i>Ask him how I can become
a man of God.</i>

493
01:18:25.797 --> 01:18:28.213
<i>Stop it. just ask him!</i>

494
01:18:29.421 --> 01:18:33.713
He asks how he can become
a man of God.

495
01:18:35.213 --> 01:18:36.553
How?

496
01:18:36.673 --> 01:18:37.429
Yes.

497
01:18:37.549 --> 01:18:39.549
Yes...

498
01:18:40.837 --> 01:18:44.053
Why do you suddenly
want to be a man of God?

499
01:18:44.173 --> 01:18:47.381
<i>Why do you suddenly
want to be a man of God?</i>

500
01:18:49.005 --> 01:18:51.629
<i>I...
- You start by giving yourself.</i>

501
01:18:52.757 --> 01:18:55.173
<i>You have to give yourself.</i>

502
01:18:57.757 --> 01:18:59.053
<i>To God?</i>

503
01:18:59.173 --> 01:19:01.173
To God?
- Yes.

504
01:19:03.213 --> 01:19:05.177
<i>There's nothing more to it?</i>

505
01:19:05.297 --> 01:19:07.297
Is that it?

506
01:19:08.505 --> 01:19:10.053
And follow his words.

507
01:19:10.173 --> 01:19:12.137
<i>Follow his words.</i>

508
01:19:12.257 --> 01:19:13.637
Pray to him.

509
01:19:13.757 --> 01:19:15.885
<i>Pray.</i>

510
01:19:16.005 --> 01:19:17.429
Listen.

511
01:19:17.549 --> 01:19:19.549
<i>Listen.</i>

512
01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:22.801
<i>How do I listen?</i>

513
01:19:22.921 --> 01:19:25.257
<i>How do I hear him?</i>

514
01:19:26.213 --> 01:19:30.093
How... can he hear him?

515
01:19:30.213 --> 01:19:34.509
It's not just about hearing.
It's more of a feeling.

516
01:19:34.629 --> 01:19:40.005
You must forget yourself
and submit to God by serving him.

517
01:19:42.297 --> 01:19:47.929
<i>It's not just about listening...
It's...</i>

518
01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:49.885
I need to hear it again.

519
01:19:50.005 --> 01:19:53.690
He must forget himself
and submit to God by serving him.

520
01:19:54.921 --> 01:19:59.717
<i>You must forget yourself
and serve God...</i>

521
01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:02.629
<i>or something like that.</i>

522
01:20:07.589 --> 01:20:10.637
<i>Tell him that when I was a child
my mother told me</i>

523
01:20:10.757 --> 01:20:14.337
<i>that the King of Denmark
was just an ordinary man.</i>

524
01:20:15.005 --> 01:20:19.881
<i>She told me that I would grow and
that one day I would become a man.</i>

525
01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:25.270
<i>Therefore. I always thought
that I would be the King of Denmark.</i>

526
01:20:42.549 --> 01:20:47.637
So that. in their innermost heart.
they believe in you. their God

527
01:20:47.757 --> 01:20:49.885
and worship and serve you.
their maker and Savior.

528
01:20:50.005 --> 01:20:51.801
who makes them holy

529
01:20:51.921 --> 01:20:54.969
so that they may renounce the Devil
and all his deeds.

530
01:20:55.089 --> 01:20:58.137
this wicked world's
pomp and vanity

531
01:20:58.257 --> 01:21:00.801
and all the sinful desires
of the flesh.

532
01:21:00.921 --> 01:21:03.429
and preserve thy holy will
and command.

533
01:21:03.549 --> 01:21:06.469
and not be lost in their lives.

534
01:21:06.589 --> 01:21:10.673
Fill their hearts with the love
of thy name. let a true...

535
01:21:35.005 --> 01:21:37.005
<i>There. there.</i>

536
01:21:47.381 --> 01:21:49.381
<i>You are big.</i>

537
01:21:53.589 --> 01:21:55.589
<i>No. no.</i>

538
01:22:54.005 --> 01:22:55.637
The rooster doesn't seem happy.

539
01:22:55.757 --> 01:22:57.757
Okay.

540
01:22:58.173 --> 01:22:59.885
Do you know where father's tie is?

541
01:23:00.005 --> 01:23:02.297
Isn't it on the table?

542
01:23:10.837 --> 01:23:14.857
I think you might have killed
the rooster's favorite chicken.

543
01:23:16.337 --> 01:23:18.883
Don't you think
he will find a new one?

544
01:23:19.921 --> 01:23:21.921
I don't know.

545
01:23:28.257 --> 01:23:30.257
They are waiting for you.

546
01:23:38.337 --> 01:23:41.549
Yes. that's good.
Can you assist me?

547
01:23:54.337 --> 01:23:56.629
So... how does your old man look?

548
01:24:00.465 --> 01:24:02.465
Let me see your teeth.

549
01:24:04.005 --> 01:24:07.297
Dear child... you are an animal.

550
01:24:09.549 --> 01:24:11.549
Now. get out of here.

551
01:24:24.381 --> 01:24:26.381
<i>Aren't you gonna kiss her?</i>

552
01:24:49.173 --> 01:24:52.054
Why couldn't you marry
these poor creatures?

553
01:24:53.465 --> 01:24:55.589
Not in a half-finished church.

554
01:24:59.837 --> 01:25:01.837
You are an odd one.

555
01:29:02.837 --> 01:29:04.385
Why are you so serious?

556
01:29:04.505 --> 01:29:06.505
Serious?
- Yes.

557
01:29:08.713 --> 01:29:10.713
You look very serious.

558
01:29:13.465 --> 01:29:16.078
I’m just trying to
focus on dancing...

559
01:29:41.337 --> 01:29:43.337
Could I have this dance?

560
01:29:44.337 --> 01:29:46.337
Thank you. father.

561
01:30:26.589 --> 01:30:28.589
<i>Your breath stinks.</i>

562
01:30:45.757 --> 01:30:47.301
It's your turn.

563
01:30:47.421 --> 01:30:49.421
My turn for what?

564
01:30:49.673 --> 01:30:51.093
No. no. I won't.
- Yes. sure.

565
01:30:51.213 --> 01:30:53.177
Yes. indeed.
- No.

566
01:30:53.297 --> 01:30:55.381
<i>My father wants to try!</i>

567
01:30:56.965 --> 01:30:58.965
You can do it!

568
01:31:00.089 --> 01:31:02.089
Thanks.

569
01:31:03.465 --> 01:31:05.465
Thank you. daughter.

570
01:31:37.089 --> 01:31:39.173
That was good!

571
01:31:46.257 --> 01:31:48.257
I pick the priest.

572
01:31:52.713 --> 01:31:54.469
Come on. priest!

573
01:31:54.589 --> 01:31:56.845
Thanks. but no thanks.
- Yes. yes.

574
01:31:56.965 --> 01:31:58.385
Come on.

575
01:31:58.505 --> 01:32:00.505
Come on!

576
01:32:04.257 --> 01:32:06.921
I think father wants to
dance with you.

577
01:32:14.837 --> 01:32:16.837
Off with the coat.

578
01:32:19.005 --> 01:32:21.005
Just give it to me.

579
01:32:24.673 --> 01:32:29.137
Okay. come here.
Now this hand.

580
01:32:29.257 --> 01:32:31.257
And here. Right?

581
01:32:32.089 --> 01:32:34.089
And then we dance around.

582
01:32:40.673 --> 01:32:42.921
Just try to...

583
01:32:45.257 --> 01:32:47.297
And the foot... yes.

584
01:32:50.213 --> 01:32:52.213
Like this. It's good.

585
01:32:54.049 --> 01:32:58.173
That looks dumb.
- They look like our rooster.

586
01:33:02.005 --> 01:33:05.173
Well done. priest! Well done!

587
01:33:18.797 --> 01:33:19.677
Am I done?

588
01:33:19.797 --> 01:33:21.385
No. you continue.

589
01:33:21.505 --> 01:33:24.629
<i>Ragnar! You take him!</i>

590
01:33:45.257 --> 01:33:47.257
<i>Well...</i>

591
01:34:20.257 --> 01:34:22.257
<i>Hey!</i>

592
01:34:29.005 --> 01:34:32.881
<i>You grab here!
Don't go for my back!</i>

593
01:36:19.713 --> 01:36:21.713
Good morning. Lucas.

594
01:36:22.257 --> 01:36:25.177
Good morning. Anna.
- Where's your horse?

595
01:36:25.297 --> 01:36:27.505
I think I've lost it.

596
01:36:28.257 --> 01:36:30.337
Was the corral open?

597
01:36:31.505 --> 01:36:32.845
No.

598
01:36:32.965 --> 01:36:36.845
No? That's strange.
Should we go look for it?

599
01:36:36.965 --> 01:36:39.385
No. I think it will return.

600
01:36:39.505 --> 01:36:41.505
I'm sure it will.

601
01:36:42.505 --> 01:36:44.469
You can borrow my sister's horse.

602
01:36:44.589 --> 01:36:46.666
You think she's okay with that?

603
01:36:47.173 --> 01:36:49.173
I don't care.

604
01:36:50.213 --> 01:36:52.213
Come.

605
01:37:02.965 --> 01:37:04.177
They took my horse.

606
01:37:04.297 --> 01:37:05.593
What?

607
01:37:05.713 --> 01:37:09.177
Your daughter and the priest...
they took my horse.

608
01:37:09.297 --> 01:37:11.177
They didn't borrow it?

609
01:37:11.297 --> 01:37:13.797
It's only borrowing if you ask.

610
01:37:24.797 --> 01:37:27.589
Do you think Anna
will marry the priest?

611
01:37:34.673 --> 01:37:37.713
No one should have to
marry a priest.

612
01:37:39.297 --> 01:37:41.297
You don't like him?

613
01:37:43.005 --> 01:37:47.257
I have nothing against Lucas.
but we don't need men like him.

614
01:37:49.089 --> 01:37:51.421
What kind of men do we need?

615
01:37:51.881 --> 01:37:53.345
We don't need more men.

616
01:37:53.465 --> 01:37:56.346
Now. check my coat.
there are letters there.

617
01:38:01.673 --> 01:38:03.673
Come on! Quick!

618
01:38:11.837 --> 01:38:13.837
<i>Wait!</i>

619
01:38:19.965 --> 01:38:20.969
<i>For my dad.</i>

620
01:38:21.089 --> 01:38:23.089
<i>Thank you.</i>

621
01:38:29.713 --> 01:38:31.713
<i>Goodbye.
- Goodbye.</i>

622
01:38:43.505 --> 01:38:45.673
Your horse is in trotting.

623
01:38:46.465 --> 01:38:48.465
What?

624
01:38:48.713 --> 01:38:50.509
Your horse is trotting...

625
01:38:50.629 --> 01:38:53.421
It's better if you
can make it slow trot.

626
01:38:54.465 --> 01:38:57.213
Slow trot... I don't know...

627
01:39:00.673 --> 01:39:02.673
Watch me.

628
01:39:03.549 --> 01:39:10.505
Try pulling a little. just a little.
and then slowly release.

629
01:39:12.089 --> 01:39:14.089
Look at me.

630
01:39:14.465 --> 01:39:16.465
Slowly... and back.

631
01:39:17.257 --> 01:39:19.385
Anna. I didn't grow up on a horse.

632
01:39:19.505 --> 01:39:23.921
But you have ridden
across all of Iceland to get here.

633
01:39:24.837 --> 01:39:26.881
I want my own horse!

634
01:39:27.757 --> 01:39:29.757
Þorskur!

635
01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:32.929
Þorskur! Where are you!?!

636
01:39:33.049 --> 01:39:34.509
You have to reward it.

637
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:35.929
With what? I have no food.

638
01:39:36.049 --> 01:39:40.093
No. not with food...
you reward it by giving back.

639
01:39:40.213 --> 01:39:42.213
Release.

640
01:39:43.673 --> 01:39:46.921
Try giving it a kick
and then do this sound...

641
01:39:49.505 --> 01:39:51.505
Come!

642
01:39:52.257 --> 01:39:54.881
Come now. Lucas!
Kick it!

643
01:39:58.213 --> 01:40:00.213
Are you with me?

644
01:42:48.173 --> 01:42:51.049
Anna! Quickly.

645
01:42:53.921 --> 01:42:56.173
Can I enter?
- Come!

646
01:43:07.673 --> 01:43:09.673
Wow.

647
01:43:14.757 --> 01:43:17.381
I look very serious.

648
01:43:20.257 --> 01:43:24.137
And older than I
thought I looked.

649
01:43:24.257 --> 01:43:27.465
You look young... and beautiful.

650
01:43:30.257 --> 01:43:35.177
I want to look old and smart... wise.

651
01:43:35.297 --> 01:43:38.589
I don't want to look ignorant.

652
01:43:43.337 --> 01:43:46.421
But I don't want to grow old here.

653
01:43:47.421 --> 01:43:50.053
What do you want to do?

654
01:43:50.173 --> 01:43:52.505
I want to go home.

655
01:43:53.505 --> 01:43:54.677
Then do that.

656
01:43:54.797 --> 01:43:57.177
And I will. One day.

657
01:43:57.297 --> 01:44:03.757
One day I will travel from my home
in Iceland to my home in Denmark.

658
01:44:05.089 --> 01:44:07.385
So. you have two homes?

659
01:44:07.505 --> 01:44:08.301
Yes.

660
01:44:08.421 --> 01:44:10.885
You were born in Denmark?
- Yes.

661
01:44:11.005 --> 01:44:13.885
I moved away when I was six.

662
01:44:14.005 --> 01:44:16.173
Can you remember it?

663
01:44:19.257 --> 01:44:23.921
I... can remember certain things.

664
01:44:24.921 --> 01:44:28.089
I remember trees.

665
01:44:28.797 --> 01:44:31.005
We don't have them here.

666
01:44:32.005 --> 01:44:35.465
Nothing grows in Iceland. right?

667
01:44:36.505 --> 01:44:42.677
A tree will be eaten by an animal.
a horse for example.

668
01:44:42.797 --> 01:44:47.089
or the winter will tear it apart.

669
01:44:50.589 --> 01:44:53.421
But it's terribly beautiful here.

670
01:44:58.089 --> 01:45:00.421
Yes. it's terrible.

671
01:45:05.505 --> 01:45:07.589
And beautiful.

672
01:45:33.297 --> 01:45:35.297
<i>Greetings. priest.</i>

673
01:45:36.257 --> 01:45:38.257
Ragnar.

674
01:45:39.005 --> 01:45:43.885
<i>I'm sorry... but now that the church
is almost wind-proof.</i>

675
01:45:44.005 --> 01:45:46.965
<i>I'll start preparing my journey home.</i>

676
01:45:51.797 --> 01:45:55.757
<i>I have to leave
before autumn really hits us.</i>

677
01:45:58.797 --> 01:46:01.421
<i>I thought...</i>

678
01:46:02.549 --> 01:46:06.549
<i>I could get my own
photo before I leave.</i>

679
01:46:11.673 --> 01:46:13.713
I don't understand you.

680
01:46:21.005 --> 01:46:24.053
<i>I want to own a photograph
of myself.</i>

681
01:46:24.173 --> 01:46:27.054
I still don't understand
what you're saying.

682
01:46:29.049 --> 01:46:31.717
<i>What is it you don't understand?
I just need one...</i>

683
01:46:31.837 --> 01:46:33.837
I have no silver left.

684
01:46:35.421 --> 01:46:38.771
<i>Don't pack it down yet...
- Don't touch the things!</i>

685
01:46:46.757 --> 01:46:48.757
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

686
01:46:50.421 --> 01:46:55.837
Without silver. I cannot take
a photo. Do you understand?

687
01:46:56.921 --> 01:47:01.881
Look here. there's nothing left.
There is no silver. it's finished.

688
01:47:06.213 --> 01:47:08.629
Now. leave me alone.

689
01:47:17.005 --> 01:47:18.677
<i>I just need one photo. just one.</i>

690
01:47:18.797 --> 01:47:21.053
Hey! Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!

691
01:47:21.173 --> 01:47:23.301
I can't and I don't want to
take a photo

692
01:47:23.421 --> 01:47:27.673
of your ugly. hideous face.
you brainless swine!

693
01:49:26.257 --> 01:49:28.965
Do you know what Sunday Danish is?

694
01:49:30.337 --> 01:49:34.345
My mother always spoke Danish
on Sundays.

695
01:49:34.465 --> 01:49:36.673
It's a tradition around here.

696
01:49:38.421 --> 01:49:41.929
I wasn't really interested
in learning.

697
01:49:42.049 --> 01:49:44.881
but when you hear it every week.

698
01:49:46.005 --> 01:49:50.549
you slowly start to pick it up.
Whether you like it or not.

699
01:49:53.549 --> 01:49:56.177
I think it's an ugly language.

700
01:49:56.297 --> 01:49:58.965
it feels wrong in my throat.

701
01:50:00.965 --> 01:50:03.673
You get tired from speaking it.

702
01:50:07.757 --> 01:50:09.757
Don't worry.

703
01:50:11.005 --> 01:50:13.213
I won't become violent.

704
01:50:14.297 --> 01:50:16.297
I'm not an animal.

705
01:50:20.173 --> 01:50:22.173
Are you an animal?

706
01:50:24.757 --> 01:50:26.797
Did you find your horse?

707
01:50:31.505 --> 01:50:34.673
I once pissed in
someone else's water.

708
01:50:36.757 --> 01:50:38.757
Pray for me.

709
01:50:43.005 --> 01:50:46.629
I once laughed at someone
who was injured.

710
01:50:49.505 --> 01:50:51.505
Pray for me.

711
01:50:56.713 --> 01:51:00.381
I have been selfish and a coward.

712
01:51:02.465 --> 01:51:04.465
Pray for me.

713
01:51:09.757 --> 01:51:13.257
I have dirty thoughts
almost all the time.

714
01:51:15.297 --> 01:51:17.297
Pray for me.

715
01:51:25.797 --> 01:51:31.213
I have let someone die
when I could have saved their life.

716
01:51:33.005 --> 01:51:35.005
Pray for me.

717
01:51:41.213 --> 01:51:43.337
I'm full of shit.

718
01:51:45.589 --> 01:51:47.589
Pray for me.

719
01:51:56.173 --> 01:51:58.213
I'm afraid of God.

720
01:51:59.549 --> 01:52:01.549
Pray for me.

721
01:52:08.757 --> 01:52:11.049
I killed your horse.

722
01:52:13.757 --> 01:52:15.757
Pray for me.

723
01:52:49.005 --> 01:52:51.005
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

724
01:53:42.337 --> 01:53:44.629
That wasn’t so funny.

725
01:53:48.465 --> 01:53:50.549
Now you need to sleep.

726
01:53:51.673 --> 01:53:53.673
You smell nice.

727
01:54:03.337 --> 01:54:05.337
Should I sing for you?

728
01:56:05.049 --> 01:56:07.049
What happened?

729
01:56:08.505 --> 01:56:10.629
I lost your horse.

730
01:56:13.965 --> 01:56:20.213
That's alright. It'll come back.
It always comes back.

731
01:56:21.213 --> 01:56:25.129
I lost your horse.
and I lost my horse. it's...

732
01:56:26.837 --> 01:56:28.677
It doesn't matter.

733
01:56:28.797 --> 01:56:34.297
I can't carry this anymore...
I am tired of all this equipment.

734
01:56:36.713 --> 01:56:38.713
It doesn't matter.

735
01:57:31.337 --> 01:57:34.337
Kiss me again
without closing your mouth.

736
01:59:12.713 --> 01:59:15.505
I don't want you
to get involved with him.

737
01:59:21.337 --> 01:59:23.481
I don't think he's good for you.

738
01:59:26.549 --> 01:59:28.894
I don't think he'll make you happy.

739
01:59:30.005 --> 01:59:32.484
And I don't think
he'll stay for long.

740
01:59:33.549 --> 01:59:34.929
Do you hear what I'm saying?

741
01:59:35.049 --> 01:59:36.137
Yes.

742
01:59:36.257 --> 01:59:37.637
And what am I saying?

743
01:59:37.757 --> 01:59:40.837
Don't get involved
with the priest. -Good.

744
02:01:52.673 --> 02:01:57.837
Our Father. who art in heaven.
hallowed be thy Name.

745
02:02:02.713 --> 02:02:06.465
Oh. God. Merciful father.

746
02:02:07.465 --> 02:02:11.418
we thank you for the generosity
of your foresight and grace.

747
02:02:12.005 --> 02:02:14.345
and especially
for your almighty goodness.

748
02:02:14.465 --> 02:02:16.637
when you send the Holy Ghost.

749
02:02:16.757 --> 02:02:19.929
the blessed consoler. to take
residence in your church

750
02:02:20.049 --> 02:02:22.381
for all eternity.

751
02:02:22.757 --> 02:02:28.629
and to lead. make holy
and rule thy people's hearts.

752
02:02:30.549 --> 02:02:32.509
This morning.
we wait by your footstool

753
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:35.637
for new signs of your grace.

754
02:02:35.757 --> 02:02:40.797
which can rectify our weaknesses.
stoke our thoughts

755
02:02:42.713 --> 02:02:46.505
and instill in us a spirit of prayer
and invocation.

756
02:02:47.549 --> 02:02:51.921
Grant us. we beg you that the Holy...

757
02:02:58.213 --> 02:03:04.049
Grant us. we beg you
that the Holy Ghost may now rest.

758
02:03:14.173 --> 02:03:18.469
And instill in us
a spirit of prayer and invocation.

759
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:20.589
Grant us...

760
02:03:43.213 --> 02:03:45.213
Is it the dog?

761
02:04:09.837 --> 02:04:11.837
Shhh!

762
02:04:13.005 --> 02:04:15.005
Go away!

763
02:05:15.837 --> 02:05:17.837
It's all right.

764
02:05:27.837 --> 02:05:29.301
Should I play something?

765
02:05:29.421 --> 02:05:31.421
No!

766
02:06:10.921 --> 02:06:13.053
What are you doing out here?

767
02:06:13.173 --> 02:06:16.757
Come. Come now.

768
02:06:22.797 --> 02:06:24.929
Get it ready for me.

769
02:06:25.049 --> 02:06:25.929
Why?

770
02:06:26.049 --> 02:06:28.049
Just do what you're told.

771
02:06:34.049 --> 02:06:36.049
Where is the priest?

772
02:06:38.089 --> 02:06:41.257
<i>There. there. Good boy.</i>

773
02:06:46.465 --> 02:06:48.465
That's good.

774
02:06:56.129 --> 02:06:57.845
<i>There now. good boy.</i>

775
02:06:57.965 --> 02:07:00.965
<i>Follow me.</i>

776
02:07:03.797 --> 02:07:05.797
<i>There.</i>

777
02:07:08.257 --> 02:07:09.593
What are you doing?

778
02:07:09.713 --> 02:07:11.301
Father told me to get it ready.

779
02:07:11.421 --> 02:07:12.637
Where is he?

780
02:07:12.757 --> 02:07:14.757
Inside.

781
02:07:19.837 --> 02:07:21.837
What are you doing?

782
02:07:22.549 --> 02:07:24.549
Where is Lucas?

783
02:07:26.089 --> 02:07:29.213
Father? Where is Lucas?

784
02:07:29.921 --> 02:07:32.266
That's what I'm trying to find out.

785
02:07:40.589 --> 02:07:42.385
Go back to the church.

786
02:07:42.505 --> 02:07:44.217
What should I say?

787
02:07:44.337 --> 02:07:46.337
I don't know.

788
02:08:00.965 --> 02:08:03.089
Alright. hold it still.

789
02:08:15.089 --> 02:08:16.885
What are you planning on doing?

790
02:08:17.005 --> 02:08:19.005
Talk to him.

791
02:08:20.257 --> 02:08:22.093
You promise you'll just talk to him?

792
02:08:22.213 --> 02:08:23.845
Anna. keep an eye on your sister.

793
02:08:23.965 --> 02:08:25.137
You promise?

794
02:08:25.257 --> 02:08:26.553
Yes.

795
02:08:26.673 --> 02:08:28.593
Do you swear on my sister's life?

796
02:08:28.713 --> 02:08:30.713
I can't do that.

797
02:09:48.337 --> 02:09:51.285
Do you know why
I caught up with you so fast?

798
02:09:52.757 --> 02:09:55.504
Because you don't take care
of your horse.

799
02:09:57.049 --> 02:09:59.049
You need to let it rest.

800
02:10:00.465 --> 02:10:02.845
And it's also too fat.

801
02:10:02.965 --> 02:10:05.345
But that's not your fault.

802
02:10:05.465 --> 02:10:09.713
I admit. my daughter
is to blame for that.

803
02:10:18.465 --> 02:10:20.465
Get off her horse.

804
02:10:29.089 --> 02:10:31.381
What do you want?

805
02:10:34.965 --> 02:10:38.837
I have no ambition to be
a man of great knowledge.

806
02:10:40.213 --> 02:10:45.217
The older I get. the more I realize
that I know what I know.

807
02:10:45.337 --> 02:10:49.381
and that what I think...
is not very important.

808
02:10:52.797 --> 02:10:58.589
I'm convinced that we are all
very small and fleeting.

809
02:11:02.465 --> 02:11:07.337
I'm sorry about this. Lucas.
I truly am.

810
02:11:08.213 --> 02:11:11.629
But you must've fallen off
your horse.

811
02:14:47.921 --> 02:14:50.129
<i>Everything will be okay.</i>

812
02:14:52.713 --> 02:14:57.549
<i>Soon. flowers and grass will grow
and you will be in them...</i>

813
02:15:13.921 --> 02:15:16.005
<i>and that's beautiful.</i>

814
02:16:30.005 --> 02:16:38.005
In Denmark I was born.
'tis there my home is.

815
02:16:39.049 --> 02:16:47.049
From there my roots.
and there my world extend.

816
02:16:47.589 --> 02:16:55.589
You Danish tongue.
as soft as Mother's voice is.

817
02:16:56.673 --> 02:17:04.673
With you my heartbeats
O so sweetly blend.

818
02:17:06.337 --> 02:17:11.385
You windswept Danish strand.

819
02:17:11.505 --> 02:17:16.637
Where Dannebrog is waving.

820
02:17:16.757 --> 02:17:24.757
You came - O flag - from God.
our foes outbraving!

821
02:17:27.797 --> 02:17:34.553
'Tis you I love

822
02:17:34.673 --> 02:17:42.345
Denmark. my native land!

823
02:17:42.465 --> 02:17:49.173
GODLAND (in Danish)

824
02:17:53.837 --> 02:17:57.881
<i>GODLAND (in Icelandic)</i>

825
02:17:59.297 --> 02:18:02.589
To my parents
