00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.967
- Good morning. Abby!
- Good morning. Sean.

6
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.500
It's going to be a good day.

7
00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:55.433
It's a rainless morning
in Seattle.

8
00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:56.367
How's Bella?

9
00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.667
Vet said no fleas.
thanks for asking.

10
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.266
Mmhm.

11
00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.333
Your wedding dress?

12
00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:00.900
Yep. I don't want the movers
anywhere near it.

13
00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:02.467
Smart. Peek?

14
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.500
Nope. You'll have to wait
four weeks.

15
00:01:04.633 --> 00:01:06.367
Twenty-eight days. to be exact.

16
00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.066
So stoked for Paris.

17
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.333
Today's list. please.

18
00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:10.867
Yes. The clothes I shipped
last week will arrive in Paris

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.033
the day you land.

20
00:01:12.166 --> 00:01:13.133
Ok. perfect. Will they be...

21
00:01:13.266 --> 00:01:14.967
Yes. waiting for you
in your suite at the Ritz.

22
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.100
Great. and?

23
00:01:16.233 --> 00:01:17.734
The wedding coordinator.
Francois called from Paris.

24
00:01:17.867 --> 00:01:18.734
He has a really thick accent

25
00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:20.233
but I think he said
"flowers splendid."

26
00:01:20.367 --> 00:01:21.200
Great.

27
00:01:21.333 --> 00:01:22.200
Or it might have been
"flowers dead."

28
00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:23.166
I can't be sure.

29
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:24.800
Oh. let's go with splendid.

30
00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:25.967
And?

31
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.367
You and Edward are scheduled
to Zoom tonight at 9:00PM

32
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.000
with Francois to finalize
the menu.

33
00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:31.734
Perfect. Can I get a hard copy
of what he's come up with?

34
00:01:31.867 --> 00:01:33.066
On your desk.

35
00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:36.033
As of this morning.
there are now 287 RSVPs.

36
00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:37.800
What's French
for "panic attack?"

37
00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:40.066
9:00PM? Isn't that
a little late for a Zoom?

38
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.633
6:00AM tomorrow morning.
Paris time.

39
00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:43.467
Right. Sometimes I forget
I'm moving nine hours

40
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.700
into the future.

41
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.367
What. is there something else?

42
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.567
It's just... I'm going
to miss you.

43
00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.800
Same. And don't worry because
you're reassigned to marketing.

44
00:01:58.934 --> 00:01:59.967
we'll still be working together.

45
00:02:00.166 --> 00:02:01.700
just on opposite sides
of the world.

46
00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:03.800
Awesome. I am excited.

47
00:02:03.934 --> 00:02:05.867
Oh. and I sent you a link for
your French marriage license.

48
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.033
You and Edward just need
to DocuSign.

49
00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:09.467
Oh.

50
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.133
Are you ok?

51
00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:12.867
In all the rush I completely forgot.

52
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.967
I can't believe myself sometimes.

53
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.233
What is it?

54
00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:18.133
I'll need you to access the
Benton County records portal

55
00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:20.100
and download a copy
of my divorce decree.

56
00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:21.533
I'll need that for
the marriage license.

57
00:02:21.667 --> 00:02:23.200
Wait. you were married?

58
00:02:23.333 --> 00:02:25.533
For less than a month
when I was 18.

59
00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:26.867
A stupid mistake
from my youth.

60
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.934
What happened?

61
00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:30.100
I woke up one morning
to a note on his pillow.

62
00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:31.633
He ran off to Alaska.

63
00:02:31.767 --> 00:02:33.600
You're kidding.
What did the note say?

64
00:02:33.734 --> 00:02:34.767
Just that he wasn't ready
for marriage.

65
00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:35.567
something like that.

66
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:36.700
Ouch.

67
00:02:39.233 --> 00:02:42.800
So the divorce papers?
Maybe you should get on that.

68
00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:44.166
Right.

69
00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.367
Oh hey. in comes
my best customer.

70
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.367
Morning. Luke.

71
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.100
Morning. Joe. So. listen.
is my order ready?

72
00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:31.200
You bet.

73
00:03:33.467 --> 00:03:34.400
Ah.

74
00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:37.667
Here you go. Two cans
of Oyster White. flat.

75
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.300
On your account.

76
00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:39.533
Excellent. Thanks. man

77
00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:42.700
Yeah. I figured you won the bid
on that Johnson house.

78
00:03:42.834 --> 00:03:45.333
considering you changed
the order three times already.

79
00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:47.667
Well. let's be honest. not
the most decisive of clients.

80
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.767
Yeah. so I heard.

81
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.934
Hey. I also heard about
your other painting gig.

82
00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:53.166
Not that those clients need
a lot of handholding.

83
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.133
That bunch?

84
00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:55.300
Come on. they're the most
decisive clients

85
00:03:55.433 --> 00:03:56.800
I've ever worked with. Joe.

86
00:04:01.066 --> 00:04:04.100
Very nice. I like that.

87
00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:10.333
Travis. that is so amazing.

88
00:04:10.467 --> 00:04:12.266
But no trees?

89
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.900
It's in the future.
When all the trees are gone.

90
00:04:15.033 --> 00:04:18.266
Oh. ok. I see.
That's kind of sad. isn't it?

91
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.166
It is what it is.

92
00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:22.100
Well. I have a great idea.

93
00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:24.000
What do you think. we put
some beautiful trees in there

94
00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:26.333
and maybe it'll spur people
to fight for them.

95
00:04:26.467 --> 00:04:28.066
Like. inspire them?

96
00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.734
Exactly like inspire.
Give it some thought. bud.

97
00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.266
Wow.

98
00:04:45.533 --> 00:04:46.667
Pardon me. miss.

99
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.166
You know where I can find a good
cup of coffee around here?

100
00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.934
Bonsoir. mon amour.

101
00:04:51.066 --> 00:04:53.900
Bonsoir. Un bisou
s'il vous plait.

102
00:04:55.166 --> 00:04:58.734
Mm. I've been looking forward
to that all day.

103
00:04:58.867 --> 00:04:59.867
Do you want to elope.
right now?

104
00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:03.133
Just find a Justice of the Peace
or a notary public

105
00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:04.567
and just get married right now?

106
00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:05.834
Notaries can marry people?

107
00:05:05.967 --> 00:05:07.233
Apparently. Yes.

108
00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:08.133
Hm.

109
00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:09.667
No. no. no. Please.
Put that down.

110
00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.667
No more work.

111
00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.600
No. Edward. I have so much
I need to do.

112
00:05:12.734 --> 00:05:14.633
I know. but you can take
a little break.

113
00:05:14.767 --> 00:05:15.967
Ugh.

114
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.600
So. Ruthie scored highest
in her class.

115
00:05:20.734 --> 00:05:22.967
What? Ruthie. that's great!

116
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.967
Mr. Hansen said it was the best
sophomore paper he's ever read.

117
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.500
Wow. I'm so proud of you.
that's fabulous.

118
00:05:29.633 --> 00:05:31.567
Look at this. you know.
my niece is a writer.

119
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:33.900
But. I also want to ask.
how is the music going?

120
00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:35.567
I've actually started
my own band.

121
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.467
Really?

122
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.567
It's called Ruthie's
Status Update.

123
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.467
Of course it is.
Of course it is.

124
00:05:42.633 --> 00:05:43.533
You know. one day we'll say
we knew you when.

125
00:05:43.667 --> 00:05:46.266
Or in my case. I will say
I birthed her when.

126
00:05:48.266 --> 00:05:50.166
Mom. Claire and Ashley
are texting. Can I go?

127
00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.400
Alright. Just say thanks
to your uncle Luke first.

128
00:05:52.533 --> 00:05:54.233
Thank you for getting
my favorite spicy tofu.

129
00:05:54.367 --> 00:05:54.800
Bring it in.

130
00:05:54.934 --> 00:05:55.567
Thank you.

131
00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:56.467
- Bye. Love you.
- Love you.

132
00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.633
Love you too!

133
00:05:58.633 --> 00:06:01.333
Ugh. In two years she will be
in college.

134
00:06:01.467 --> 00:06:02.700
I know. That's crazy.

135
00:06:02.834 --> 00:06:04.400
I mean. she's grown up
so fast. Robin.

136
00:06:05.633 --> 00:06:07.900
Listen. I'm sorry I missed
so much of it. I am.

137
00:06:08.033 --> 00:06:09.300
Well. you're here now.

138
00:06:09.433 --> 00:06:10.734
And thank you.
by the way.

139
00:06:10.867 --> 00:06:11.667
For what?

140
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.200
For being such a great uncle
to her.

141
00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:16.200
Well. she's a great person.

142
00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:17.967
I agree.

143
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.233
Single motherhood is its own
art form. you know.

144
00:06:20.367 --> 00:06:22.500
Oh yeah. And you are
Frida Kahlo.

145
00:06:22.633 --> 00:06:24.266
Oh. you're sweet.

146
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.633
I think that's my favorite
of yours.

147
00:06:27.767 --> 00:06:29.000
Oh. really?

148
00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:30.533
Yeah.

149
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:32.400
Yeah. mine too.

150
00:06:32.533 --> 00:06:36.033
Whatever happened to your idea
of living for your art?

151
00:06:36.166 --> 00:06:37.867
Um. pipe dream.

152
00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:40.033
Well. maybe for now.

153
00:06:40.166 --> 00:06:42.367
but you never know
where life will take you.

154
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.633
Yeah. well. right now Robin.

155
00:06:44.767 --> 00:06:46.000
life's taken me
to the dishwasher.

156
00:06:46.133 --> 00:06:47.467
Can you grab your plate?

157
00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.867
Yes. big brother.

158
00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:03.367
Edward. you've
outdone yourself.

159
00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:06.100
Well. I thought it would be nice
to have a little picnic

160
00:07:06.233 --> 00:07:08.367
before our big call.

161
00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.734
So. I picked up a few things.

162
00:07:10.867 --> 00:07:12.734
A decidedly French theme.
I see.

163
00:07:12.867 --> 00:07:14.734
- Bien oui. ma cherie!

164
00:07:14.867 --> 00:07:18.400
To get us in the spirit
for our big adventure.

165
00:07:18.533 --> 00:07:20.066
And. from what I hear.

166
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.633
Paris has its share
of fine wine too.

167
00:07:22.767 --> 00:07:25.000
Hmm. I've heard that too.

168
00:07:30.266 --> 00:07:35.033
You know. my dad left my mom
when I was three

169
00:07:35.166 --> 00:07:38.300
and two years later she met Leo
and from then on.

170
00:07:38.433 --> 00:07:39.467
he was my rock.

171
00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.233
Always there for me.

172
00:07:41.367 --> 00:07:48.700
And. I want to thank you
for being there for me too.

173
00:07:48.834 --> 00:07:50.533
And for being willing
to go along

174
00:07:50.667 --> 00:07:53.233
and share this dream
with me.

175
00:07:54.166 --> 00:07:56.367
There's nowhere on Earth
I'd rather be

176
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.767
than right here with you.

177
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.300
You say the nicest things.

178
00:08:03.166 --> 00:08:05.700
I know this is going to present
some challenges for your work.

179
00:08:05.834 --> 00:08:09.567
No. Abby. I... I trade online.
I can do that from anywhere.

180
00:08:12.233 --> 00:08:16.967
A toast. To true love.

181
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.467
A journey that starts at forever
and ends at never.

182
00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.767
That's beautiful.
Did you write that?

183
00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:31.934
No. I got it from
a fortune cookie.

184
00:08:32.066 --> 00:08:33.834
Yeah. I had Chinese
for lunch.

185
00:08:38.567 --> 00:08:40.467
Oh! You know what
that means.

186
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.800
Time to talk wedding.

187
00:08:44.834 --> 00:08:47.033
Bonjour. Francois!

188
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.800
I can't believe the Summer
Festival's been going

189
00:08:51.934 --> 00:08:53.300
for 50 years.

190
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.467
Your mom and dad had
their first date there?

191
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.233
I know. so did I.

192
00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:03.367
Hey. did you hear
George Bingham died?

193
00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.000
I did. Yeah. he was our
divorce lawyer. you know.

194
00:09:06.133 --> 00:09:09.333
Yeah. I wonder how Abby
is these days.

195
00:09:09.467 --> 00:09:10.900
I have no idea.

196
00:09:11.033 --> 00:09:12.400
You know. I hear that she's...

197
00:09:12.533 --> 00:09:15.600
Getting married?
I heard that too.

198
00:09:15.734 --> 00:09:18.000
Her mother's been talking
about that all over town.

199
00:09:18.133 --> 00:09:20.433
Huh. So much for "no idea."

200
00:09:20.567 --> 00:09:22.600
And so much for no peace
and quiet.

201
00:09:27.734 --> 00:09:32.500
Our flagship store. in
Le Marais. is nearly complete.

202
00:09:32.633 --> 00:09:37.767
And our Parisian blend
is testing off the charts.

203
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.834
We think it's going to be
a huge seller.

204
00:09:40.967 --> 00:09:44.834
I'm really excited to get up
there and get started.

205
00:09:44.967 --> 00:09:47.367
I hope you'll all come visit.

206
00:09:52.367 --> 00:09:53.934
Ok. Sean. Next?

207
00:09:54.066 --> 00:09:55.100
Talked to the head mover guy.

208
00:09:55.233 --> 00:09:57.266
Your furniture should arrive
in France in three weeks.

209
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:58.567
Edward doesn't have
any other boxes

210
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:00.600
other than those picked up
from your house.

211
00:10:00.734 --> 00:10:02.667
Three?
I thought we paid to expedite.

212
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.500
That is expedited. Rapide.

213
00:10:04.633 --> 00:10:06.667
Tres bien. Anything more?

214
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.433
Oh. yes.

215
00:10:08.567 --> 00:10:10.066
The Benton County court
doesn't have a copy

216
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.934
of your divorce papers.

217
00:10:12.066 --> 00:10:13.734
That's odd. Please call them.

218
00:10:13.867 --> 00:10:15.100
I did call.

219
00:10:15.233 --> 00:10:17.400
A lady named Helen looked it up
and said she couldn't find them.

220
00:10:17.533 --> 00:10:18.934
Helen is my mother's
second cousin

221
00:10:19.066 --> 00:10:21.934
and while she's a lovely woman.
she couldn't find...

222
00:10:22.066 --> 00:10:25.066
I'm sure.
But she's adamant.

223
00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:26.734
Ok. so what now?

224
00:10:26.867 --> 00:10:29.934
You won't like this.
You have to appear.

225
00:10:31.033 --> 00:10:33.600
- Appear where?
- In court.

226
00:10:33.734 --> 00:10:34.367
You're joking.

227
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.333
It's a Benton County regulation.

228
00:10:36.467 --> 00:10:37.934
Both parties have to appear
in person

229
00:10:38.066 --> 00:10:39.834
in front of the Magistrate.

230
00:10:39.967 --> 00:10:41.900
I'm afraid you have to do it
if you want to get married

231
00:10:42.033 --> 00:10:45.734
in Paris or anywhere.
for that matter.

232
00:10:45.867 --> 00:10:48.000
I'm going to see Luke.

233
00:10:48.133 --> 00:10:49.100
Pardon?

234
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.700
Nothing. When?

235
00:10:55.033 --> 00:10:56.133
This is crazy.

236
00:10:56.266 --> 00:10:59.834
Why can't they just issue me
another... divorce thingy?

237
00:10:59.967 --> 00:11:01.166
Why do I have to waste
two days

238
00:11:01.300 --> 00:11:02.834
when I don't have two minutes
to spare?

239
00:11:02.967 --> 00:11:04.767
I agree. It's just
their policy.

240
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.967
All because of some ridiculous
clerical error.

241
00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:09.100
I asked them to bring the car
around out front.

242
00:11:09.233 --> 00:11:10.667
You should easily make
your 3:00 court time.

243
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.500
Push my meetings.

244
00:11:11.633 --> 00:11:12.734
I should be back
by noon tomorrow.

245
00:11:12.867 --> 00:11:13.700
I'm sorry this is happening.

246
00:11:13.834 --> 00:11:15.834
but I'm sure it's just
a minor hiccup.

247
00:11:15.967 --> 00:11:18.200
Uh-oh. Edward.

248
00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.166
Good luck!

249
00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:10.867
Hi. babe.

250
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:11.867
Hello. beautiful!

251
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.900
So. Sean told me you drove
to your hometown.

252
00:12:15.033 --> 00:12:15.834
I thought he was kidding.

253
00:12:15.967 --> 00:12:17.100
I'm so sorry. Edward.

254
00:12:17.233 --> 00:12:19.467
I knew you were in a meeting
and it happened so quickly.

255
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.467
It's. uh. interesting.

256
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.000
Yeah? How so?

257
00:12:28.934 --> 00:12:30.867
Hello?
Are you still there?

258
00:12:32.266 --> 00:12:35.300
Uh. yeah. Um. I have to go.
I'll check in later.

259
00:12:35.433 --> 00:12:36.467
But. wait. wait. wait.
why did...

260
00:12:44.967 --> 00:12:46.500
I can't. no. I'm not gonna-

261
00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:48.033
Oh! Sorry. that-

262
00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:51.266
Luke.

263
00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:54.867
Hello. Abby.

264
00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.033
How have you been?

265
00:12:56.166 --> 00:12:57.166
Fine.

266
00:12:58.767 --> 00:13:00.300
When did you move back?

267
00:13:01.233 --> 00:13:03.133
A couple years ago.

268
00:13:03.266 --> 00:13:05.133
I guess my mom forgot
to tell me.

269
00:13:05.266 --> 00:13:06.500
Yeah.

270
00:13:08.533 --> 00:13:11.300
This is weird. huh?
After all these years.

271
00:13:12.867 --> 00:13:14.000
Pretty weird.

272
00:13:17.166 --> 00:13:19.767
Guess we should get in there
and get this over with.

273
00:13:22.367 --> 00:13:23.600
Guess so.

274
00:13:25.567 --> 00:13:28.433
Mrs. Walker. any idea when
Mr. Walker will be joining us?

275
00:13:28.567 --> 00:13:31.066
I have no idea. Your Honor. I
thought he was right behind me

276
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.633
and it's Ms. Foster.
if you don't mind.

277
00:13:34.767 --> 00:13:35.767
Whatever you wish.

278
00:13:35.900 --> 00:13:37.700
It looks like the other party's
waiving his right

279
00:13:37.834 --> 00:13:39.200
to speak on the matter.

280
00:13:39.333 --> 00:13:40.533
It's ok. I can just
fill him in later.

281
00:13:40.667 --> 00:13:42.600
In the interest of time. is
there something I need to sign?

282
00:13:42.734 --> 00:13:43.467
Or...

283
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.734
I'm sorry I'm late.
Your Honor.

284
00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:51.900
You look very nice. incidentally.

285
00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:53.934
Thank you.

286
00:13:55.100 --> 00:13:56.133
Am I interrupting you two?

287
00:13:56.266 --> 00:13:57.633
Because if you'd like to carry
on this conversation

288
00:13:57.767 --> 00:14:00.200
you can do so outside
and we can reschedule.

289
00:14:00.333 --> 00:14:02.700
No. Your Honor.
we're ready to proceed.

290
00:14:02.834 --> 00:14:04.133
Mr. Walker?

291
00:14:04.266 --> 00:14:05.800
I'm ready as well. Your Honor.

292
00:14:05.934 --> 00:14:07.767
Fine. Now. the reason
you're both here

293
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:09.867
is because your attorney.
the late George Bingham.

294
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.367
neglected to file your divorce
decree with the court.

295
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.734
Very late.

296
00:14:17.734 --> 00:14:21.700
I'm sure this happens all
the time. right. Your Honor?

297
00:14:22.633 --> 00:14:25.033
I don't think His Honor likes
to be interrupted.

298
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.934
Right. Harlan?

299
00:14:27.066 --> 00:14:27.867
Luke.

300
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:29.633
I mean. Judge Perkins.

301
00:14:29.767 --> 00:14:31.667
I apologize for
the interruption. Your Honor.

302
00:14:40.467 --> 00:14:41.700
I can check that later.

303
00:14:41.834 --> 00:14:43.333
I'll cut to the chase.

304
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.834
You two are still married.

305
00:14:46.967 --> 00:14:48.133
We're what?!

306
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.333
Honey. I'm home.

307
00:14:52.467 --> 00:14:53.400
I have a full docket

308
00:14:53.533 --> 00:14:55.533
so I'd like to get this matter
resolved quickly.

309
00:14:55.667 --> 00:14:56.700
Yes!

310
00:14:56.834 --> 00:14:58.934
Your Honor. we would too.
just show me where to sign.

311
00:14:59.066 --> 00:15:01.200
All I need is for you both
to sign and initial

312
00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:05.867
this dissolution document and
you will be officially divorced.

313
00:15:07.333 --> 00:15:09.100
Bring her here.
Let's get it done.

314
00:15:13.133 --> 00:15:14.533
And...

315
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.166
All signed.

316
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.100
Hm.

317
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.600
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

318
00:15:22.367 --> 00:15:25.533
- Oh. you're gonna need this.
- Yeah. Thanks.

319
00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:38.467
Well?

320
00:15:39.967 --> 00:15:42.900
Oh... Are you kidding me?

321
00:15:43.033 --> 00:15:44.367
- Mr. Walker.
- Yes?

322
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.100
Something on your mind?

323
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:47.400
Uh...

324
00:15:47.533 --> 00:15:49.066
Sign! I have meetings.

325
00:15:49.967 --> 00:15:51.500
I'm sorry. Your Honor.

326
00:15:51.633 --> 00:15:54.233
I just. I guess I just haven't
fully digested all of this.

327
00:15:54.367 --> 00:15:56.433
It's not chicken salad.
There's nothing to digest.

328
00:15:56.567 --> 00:15:58.900
Just sign so we can get
out of here.

329
00:16:01.266 --> 00:16:01.967
Uh...

330
00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.400
- Luke!
- Yes.

331
00:16:03.533 --> 00:16:04.500
Ms. Foster...

332
00:16:05.133 --> 00:16:06.834
I'm sorry. Your Honor.
I just...

333
00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:07.900
I need to get going.

334
00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:10.300
I'm about to move to Paris
to start a new job

335
00:16:10.433 --> 00:16:14.233
and I'm getting married
in a month.... remarried.

336
00:16:14.367 --> 00:16:15.600
So. as you can imagine.

337
00:16:15.734 --> 00:16:21.500
this whole situation is a little
inconvenient. to say the least.

338
00:16:21.633 --> 00:16:22.834
- Mr. Walker.
- Yeah.

339
00:16:22.967 --> 00:16:24.166
It's clear where
Ms. Foster stands.

340
00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.500
She's already signed
the document.

341
00:16:25.633 --> 00:16:27.033
It's your move.

342
00:16:27.633 --> 00:16:28.767
And she's probably right.
Your Honor.

343
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.166
It's just. uh...

344
00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.767
I just need a moment.

345
00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:34.734
Ugh!

346
00:16:34.867 --> 00:16:36.266
Marcy. what's my next
available slot?

347
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.934
Monday morning at 10:00.
Your Honor.

348
00:16:38.066 --> 00:16:38.834
See you both then.

349
00:16:39.767 --> 00:16:40.633
Call up the next case.

350
00:16:40.767 --> 00:16:43.133
- No! Objection. Your Honor.
- Overruled.

351
00:16:43.266 --> 00:16:45.333
No. I just... I need this
taken care of today. Now.

352
00:16:45.467 --> 00:16:47.767
Sorry. Ms. Foster.
I can't force him to sign.

353
00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:49.567
I suggest the two of you
talk it over.

354
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:52.266
Let's try to resolve this
quickly for Ms. Foster's sake.

355
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:53.400
See you back here Monday.

356
00:16:56.533 --> 00:16:57.700
That's yours.

357
00:17:01.767 --> 00:17:05.200
Excuse me. pardon me.
Hey. Luke! Luke!

358
00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:06.333
Luke!

359
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.734
Luke. what was that?

360
00:17:10.867 --> 00:17:12.133
This could all be over

361
00:17:12.266 --> 00:17:14.133
but because of you I have
to wait till Monday!

362
00:17:14.266 --> 00:17:16.133
Well. it's obvious. Abby.
you're in a hurry.

363
00:17:16.266 --> 00:17:17.166
I just guess I'm not.

364
00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.867
Luke. we settled
this years ago.

365
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.567
Why can't you just sign
this stupid paper

366
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:21.633
and give me back my life?

367
00:17:21.767 --> 00:17:22.700
I'm getting married in days.

368
00:17:22.834 --> 00:17:25.567
Um. correction. Abby.
You're getting remarried.

369
00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.200
Ugh! I can't believe you.

370
00:17:27.333 --> 00:17:28.734
I guess you'll just have
to wait till Monday

371
00:17:28.867 --> 00:17:29.734
to get your life back.

372
00:17:29.867 --> 00:17:32.333
Luke. this ended the morning
you left me.

373
00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:35.400
Yeah. about that.

374
00:17:35.533 --> 00:17:36.934
About that what?

375
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.533
No. nothing. Forget it.

376
00:17:38.667 --> 00:17:39.033
What?

377
00:17:39.166 --> 00:17:40.600
Nothing. Nothing.

378
00:17:41.834 --> 00:17:43.667
I don't understand why
you're being so vindictive.

379
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.800
What did I ever do to you?

380
00:17:44.934 --> 00:17:46.533
Nothing. You've never done
anything to me. Abby.

381
00:17:46.667 --> 00:17:47.700
Trust me. ok?

382
00:17:47.834 --> 00:17:49.200
But right now. I'd just like
a little time to reflect.

383
00:17:49.333 --> 00:17:50.500
Reflect on what?

384
00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:54.967
I'm sorry this is happening
to you. Abby. I am.

385
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.667
You know what?
You don't know everything.

386
00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.033
What don't I know?

387
00:18:01.734 --> 00:18:03.000
Luke!

388
00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:12.533
It's nice talking to you too. Francois.

389
00:18:12.667 --> 00:18:16.367
Avec tes... toi too!

390
00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.934
And again. my apologies
for calling so late.

391
00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:22.600
I'm still getting used to
the time thing.

392
00:18:22.734 --> 00:18:24.100
Uh-huh.

393
00:18:24.233 --> 00:18:25.734
Au revoir!

394
00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.133
Aw.

395
00:18:28.266 --> 00:18:30.400
I can't wait to tell the book
club girls

396
00:18:30.533 --> 00:18:34.300
I actually spoke French with a
real French wedding coordinator.

397
00:18:34.433 --> 00:18:36.100
Bookies are gonna be so jealous.

398
00:18:36.233 --> 00:18:37.967
Um. why is it again you needed

399
00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.533
to call Abby's wedding
coordinator?

400
00:18:40.667 --> 00:18:41.834
I told you.

401
00:18:41.967 --> 00:18:45.533
I just want him to know that
I'm here if he needs any help.

402
00:18:45.667 --> 00:18:46.934
Or advice.

403
00:18:47.066 --> 00:18:50.066
Apparently. he's planned
over 200 weddings.

404
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.100
I think he's got it.

405
00:18:52.233 --> 00:18:53.300
Mmmhmm.

406
00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.166
Oh. is that the door?

407
00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:59.367
Abigail!
Oh. my goodness.

408
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.300
Oh!

409
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.100
Well hello there. stranger.

410
00:19:07.233 --> 00:19:08.433
Hi. Leo.

411
00:19:08.567 --> 00:19:10.000
What a lovely surprise.

412
00:19:10.133 --> 00:19:12.133
Oh. there's a surprise alright.

413
00:19:12.266 --> 00:19:14.200
You're not gonna believe
this one.

414
00:19:14.333 --> 00:19:16.967
I just found out Luke and I
are still...

415
00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:17.967
Married?!

416
00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:18.600
Mmmhmm.

417
00:19:18.734 --> 00:19:19.867
To Abby Foster?

418
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.967
No. to Taylor Swift. Robin.
Of course it's Abby Foster.

419
00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:23.667
Who else am I supposed
to still be married to?

420
00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:24.867
How did this happen?

421
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.600
Remember George Bingham.
our attorney?

422
00:19:26.734 --> 00:19:27.533
Yeah. he didn't file
the paperwork.

423
00:19:27.667 --> 00:19:29.266
Apparently they found it
squirreled around

424
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.100
in some corner in his office.

425
00:19:31.233 --> 00:19:32.367
Enjoy.

426
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.266
Well. I'm not surprised.

427
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.133
half the time he'd forgot
to pay his tab.

428
00:19:36.266 --> 00:19:38.000
Hey everybody. guess what!

429
00:19:38.133 --> 00:19:41.867
My brother here. still married
to Abby Foster.

430
00:19:43.166 --> 00:19:45.367
Oh. yeah.
Thank you.

431
00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:47.200
Oh. you're so kind.
aren't you?

432
00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:48.100
Well. you know.

433
00:19:48.233 --> 00:19:48.900
they would have found out eventually.

434
00:19:49.033 --> 00:19:51.266
- Right.
- You know this town.

435
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.367
- Hey. you know what?
- What?

436
00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.166
I bet you it wasn't
an accident.

437
00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.367
What wasn't an accident. Robin?

438
00:19:57.500 --> 00:19:58.934
George failing to file
the papers.

439
00:19:59.066 --> 00:20:01.467
I bet you he thought it was
just a passing thing

440
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.467
between the two of you
and that you should...

441
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.500
just. you know. wait it out.

442
00:20:04.633 --> 00:20:05.633
Why would he think that?

443
00:20:05.767 --> 00:20:07.433
Well. because the whole town
thought that. Luke.

444
00:20:07.567 --> 00:20:10.200
We all thought you two
should be together.

445
00:20:10.333 --> 00:20:12.800
Who's Abby Foster.
uncle Luke?

446
00:20:12.934 --> 00:20:14.667
She's someone you don't know. honey.

447
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.967
No. she is your former/current
Aunt Abby.

448
00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:19.834
Oh yay. so when can I meet

449
00:20:19.967 --> 00:20:22.700
my former/current Aunt Abby.
uncle Luke?

450
00:20:22.834 --> 00:20:25.800
Well. she's not gonna be here
for very long. unfortunately.

451
00:20:25.934 --> 00:20:27.133
She's getting married.

452
00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:29.834
Remarried.

453
00:20:29.967 --> 00:20:32.734
But... Weird.

454
00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:34.367
Yeah. my consensus exactly.

455
00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.000
Listen. it's a technical thing
and a little paperwork error.

456
00:20:37.133 --> 00:20:38.834
We'll figure it out.
we'll get it taken care of.

457
00:20:38.967 --> 00:20:39.700
Ah. ahem!

458
00:20:39.834 --> 00:20:41.767
No. no. no.
No. no. no. Please.

459
00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:43.300
In honor of my brother's

460
00:20:43.433 --> 00:20:47.533
sort of old. sort of new
marriage. pie is on the house.

461
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:54.967
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thank you.

462
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:02.800
Well. say something.

463
00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.734
Well. I thought I...

464
00:21:06.867 --> 00:21:10.233
I thought I. I mean. wasn't
this taken care of years ago?

465
00:21:10.367 --> 00:21:12.066
Luke was supposed to...

466
00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.133
He...

467
00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.834
Supposed to what. Mom?

468
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.266
You know. stay in your past.

469
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.633
Well he didn't.
Oh. what a day.

470
00:21:23.767 --> 00:21:26.600
Well don't stress yourself.
We'll talk to Luke.

471
00:21:26.734 --> 00:21:28.300
Mm! No.

472
00:21:28.433 --> 00:21:31.734
No. I don't want anyone
talking to Luke.

473
00:21:31.867 --> 00:21:33.033
I can handle this myself.

474
00:21:33.166 --> 00:21:35.467
Or. Leo can call Judge Perkins.

475
00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.300
They're on the same
bowling league team.

476
00:21:37.433 --> 00:21:39.233
No we're not
on the same team.

477
00:21:39.367 --> 00:21:42.233
I bowl for Bowl Cut.
he bowls for Spare Me.

478
00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:43.567
We're bitter rivals.

479
00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:45.233
Well. we'll figure out something.

480
00:21:45.367 --> 00:21:46.934
This is just a minor inconvenience.

481
00:21:47.066 --> 00:21:50.967
We're all gonna be laughing at
this crazy situation next month.

482
00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:53.100
in Paris. at your
wedding reception.

483
00:21:53.233 --> 00:21:55.533
This is more than a minor
inconvenience. Mom.

484
00:21:55.667 --> 00:21:58.367
I'm married to one man
and engaged to another.

485
00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.467
That qualifies as a major inconvenience.

486
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.767
It's probably a punishable
offense in several states.

487
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:05.333
Have you told Edward yet?

488
00:22:05.467 --> 00:22:08.600
No! No. there's no reason
to tell Edward.

489
00:22:08.734 --> 00:22:10.467
This is all gonna be over soon.

490
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.934
This is just a tiny setback
trying to spoil our joy.

491
00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:15.433
well we won't let it!

492
00:22:15.567 --> 00:22:17.200
All the wedding planning
is done.

493
00:22:17.333 --> 00:22:18.667
Everything's on schedule.

494
00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.834
This is just the universe
telling Abigail

495
00:22:20.967 --> 00:22:23.633
to take a deep breath
and slow down.

496
00:22:23.767 --> 00:22:24.734
Right. Leo?

497
00:22:24.867 --> 00:22:28.033
Right. We should all slow down.
shall we dear?

498
00:22:28.166 --> 00:22:32.633
I'm not not telling my fiancé
I'm married. Mom.

499
00:22:32.767 --> 00:22:34.166
We tell each other everything.

500
00:22:35.266 --> 00:22:36.967
Almost everything.

501
00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:40.300
It's him.

502
00:22:44.133 --> 00:22:45.000
Where are you going?

503
00:22:45.133 --> 00:22:46.867
I'm gonna get changed
and go for a walk.

504
00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.200
I need to think this through
before I call him back.

505
00:22:51.567 --> 00:22:53.300
You look like you're
gonna faint.

506
00:22:53.433 --> 00:22:55.033
Oh. it's nothing. I just...

507
00:22:55.166 --> 00:22:56.200
What is it?

508
00:22:56.333 --> 00:23:00.400
Oh. I just... I need
to get some air.

509
00:23:59.633 --> 00:24:01.600
Hello. old friend.

510
00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:15.600
- A lot of memories here.

511
00:24:17.734 --> 00:24:19.266
You startled me.

512
00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.533
I'm sorry.

513
00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:28.433
Why are you doing this. Luke?

514
00:24:29.967 --> 00:24:31.567
I know you think I'm trying
to be difficult. Abby.

515
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.000
but that's not it.

516
00:24:33.133 --> 00:24:34.667
Then what is it?

517
00:24:36.033 --> 00:24:38.834
Something just...
I don't know.

518
00:24:38.967 --> 00:24:41.834
Something just didn't feel right
in the court today.

519
00:24:45.367 --> 00:24:48.100
Look. I know this is
all out of nowhere.

520
00:24:48.233 --> 00:24:50.900
but it's just a clerical error.

521
00:24:51.033 --> 00:24:54.467
It's not some big sign
from the universe.

522
00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:55.967
You sure about that?

523
00:24:59.467 --> 00:25:01.333
Look. Leo bowls with the judge.

524
00:25:01.467 --> 00:25:02.834
If you'll agree to sign
the paper.

525
00:25:02.967 --> 00:25:04.166
we can finish it
this weekend.

526
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.400
We don't need to wait
until Monday.

527
00:25:06.533 --> 00:25:09.033
Actually. Abby. they're
on rival bowling teams

528
00:25:09.166 --> 00:25:12.333
so matter of fact.
they're bitter rivals.

529
00:25:12.467 --> 00:25:14.200
Look. Abby. I'm sorry. ok?

530
00:25:14.333 --> 00:25:17.133
I'm sorry about all of this but
Monday's only four days away.

531
00:25:17.266 --> 00:25:18.767
It's not a big deal. is it?

532
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:24.633
Normally no. but
I'm moving to Paris.

533
00:25:24.767 --> 00:25:25.467
I'm getting married.

534
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.000
I don't have the luxury
of time.

535
00:25:29.467 --> 00:25:30.900
Well. you used to be able
to roll with things

536
00:25:31.033 --> 00:25:33.667
a whole lot better
in the old days. huh?

537
00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.066
- Yeah. well I grew up.
- Mm.

538
00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:39.633
I roll differently now.
I don't like wasting time.

539
00:25:39.767 --> 00:25:43.000
Wasting time or spending time
with me?

540
00:25:44.934 --> 00:25:47.734
We never planned to spend time
together ever again.

541
00:25:47.867 --> 00:25:49.900
Actually. wasn't that your plan?

542
00:26:01.767 --> 00:26:06.100
What did you mean earlier about
me not knowing everything?

543
00:26:09.333 --> 00:26:13.900
I meant that not everything
is exactly as it seems. Abby.

544
00:26:14.033 --> 00:26:17.367
Oh. please. Luke.
Stop talking in riddles!

545
00:26:21.433 --> 00:26:23.266
It's my fiancé. again.

546
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.533
Now I have to go try to explain
all of this to him.

547
00:26:26.667 --> 00:26:28.734
You know we had
our first kiss here?

548
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.233
Remember? Right there.

549
00:26:38.734 --> 00:26:40.600
Of course I remember.

550
00:26:43.166 --> 00:26:45.900
A girl never forgets her
first kiss.

551
00:26:49.066 --> 00:26:51.000
I asked you to marry me
right here.

552
00:26:55.233 --> 00:26:57.700
And I said yes.

553
00:26:57.834 --> 00:27:00.667
And here we are.
20 years later.

554
00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.400
Practically strangers.
and still married.

555
00:27:06.166 --> 00:27:07.800
What do you know?

556
00:27:13.233 --> 00:27:17.033
We said we'd always be honest.
so I had to tell you.

557
00:27:17.633 --> 00:27:19.500
I'm so sorry I waited this long.

558
00:27:19.633 --> 00:27:21.000
You left out a whole marriage.

559
00:27:21.133 --> 00:27:22.500
I know...

560
00:27:23.967 --> 00:27:26.667
It lasted for less than a month
when I was 18.

561
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:28.433
Uh-huh. but you could have
told me.

562
00:27:28.567 --> 00:27:29.633
I mean. I don't know. uh.

563
00:27:29.767 --> 00:27:32.533
"guess what babe. you will not
be my first husband."

564
00:27:34.300 --> 00:27:35.900
I know. Edward.

565
00:27:38.066 --> 00:27:39.967
I guess I was just embarrassed.

566
00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.433
I never even think about
him anymore.

567
00:27:42.567 --> 00:27:43.867
Now until today. anyway.

568
00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.633
So he was in court?
Your husband.

569
00:27:46.767 --> 00:27:49.333
You see. that sounds strange.

570
00:27:50.133 --> 00:27:51.700
Yes. he was there.

571
00:27:51.834 --> 00:27:52.934
And he wouldn't sign?

572
00:27:53.066 --> 00:27:54.433
No. that's the frustrating part.

573
00:27:54.567 --> 00:27:57.033
This could all be over
if he would have just...

574
00:27:59.066 --> 00:28:01.934
The judge wanted everyone
to be sure. so here I am.

575
00:28:02.066 --> 00:28:04.433
And he's not sure?
But you're sure.

576
00:28:04.567 --> 00:28:06.233
Of course I'm sure!

577
00:28:06.367 --> 00:28:08.834
Of course.

578
00:28:08.967 --> 00:28:10.266
He's just being difficult.

579
00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.133
Well. don't worry about it.

580
00:28:11.266 --> 00:28:12.934
I know everything's gonna
work out.

581
00:28:13.066 --> 00:28:15.300
And I miss you.

582
00:28:16.667 --> 00:28:19.834
I miss you too.

583
00:28:19.967 --> 00:28:22.200
Thank you for being
so understanding.

584
00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:25.233
I'm driving home in the morning.
I'll come back Monday for court.

585
00:28:25.367 --> 00:28:26.533
No.

586
00:28:26.667 --> 00:28:27.433
What?

587
00:28:27.567 --> 00:28:28.600
It's too much driving. babe.

588
00:28:28.734 --> 00:28:31.367
Plus. I know how stressed
you get out on the highway.

589
00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:34.166
And you're going through a lot
since you landed the Paris job.

590
00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:35.500
And your mom too.

591
00:28:35.633 --> 00:28:37.066
Maybe if you spend some days
with her

592
00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.166
it'll help calm her down.

593
00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:40.567
Just take some time
to breathe.

594
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.767
I guess I could use
a few days of downtime

595
00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:44.900
to recharge for the big move.

596
00:28:45.033 --> 00:28:45.967
But I don't want to-

597
00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.166
Right. well that's why
you should stay there.

598
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.166
Spend some time
with your folks.

599
00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.767
I mean. you never know
when you're gonna be back

600
00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:53.233
in your hometown again.

601
00:28:55.467 --> 00:28:56.934
That's why I love you.

602
00:28:57.066 --> 00:28:59.367
Yeah. I love you too.

603
00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.734
Good night.

604
00:29:00.867 --> 00:29:02.767
Ok. I'll talk to you tomorrow. ok?

605
00:29:09.300 --> 00:29:10.333
There you go. honey.

606
00:29:10.467 --> 00:29:12.900
- Oh. thank you.
- Yeah.

607
00:29:13.033 --> 00:29:13.834
You know what Mom.

608
00:29:13.967 --> 00:29:16.600
I am marrying the most
understanding man

609
00:29:16.734 --> 00:29:18.300
on the face of the Earth.

610
00:29:18.433 --> 00:29:20.600
Aw. Well. that's
a wonderful trait.

611
00:29:20.734 --> 00:29:22.633
I think it's one of the most
important qualities

612
00:29:22.767 --> 00:29:25.066
one can have in a partner.

613
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:27.400
So we're all set then?

614
00:29:27.533 --> 00:29:30.800
Don't worry.
Luke will come to his senses.

615
00:29:30.934 --> 00:29:31.867
Mom. you make me nervous

616
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.900
when you talk about
how reasonable Luke is.

617
00:29:36.467 --> 00:29:37.867
All's gonna be well.

618
00:29:39.367 --> 00:29:40.900
Did you make this?

619
00:29:41.033 --> 00:29:42.767
No. when would I have had time?

620
00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:47.300
I got it at Robin's restaurant.
She's my pretend pastry chef.

621
00:29:47.433 --> 00:29:50.100
Apparently she's still
my real sister-in-law.

622
00:29:50.233 --> 00:29:51.700
Yeah.

623
00:30:03.066 --> 00:30:05.333
There you go.
contract signed.

624
00:30:05.467 --> 00:30:06.967
Thank you very much.
you two.

625
00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.667
Now. onto more
pressing business.

626
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.066
You guys both told me you
both love Oyster White. right?

627
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.834
- We still do.
- Yeah.

628
00:30:14.967 --> 00:30:15.934
It's a warm color.

629
00:30:16.066 --> 00:30:17.500
It says friendly people
live here.

630
00:30:17.633 --> 00:30:18.367
Right. Doesn't it?

631
00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:20.000
But we're not going
with that color.

632
00:30:20.133 --> 00:30:22.000
We've decided
to rethink things.

633
00:30:22.133 --> 00:30:25.934
Ok. alright. So any ideas?

634
00:30:26.066 --> 00:30:30.000
We're going to just wait
for a color to appear.

635
00:30:30.133 --> 00:30:32.600
Appear? Yeah. Ok.

636
00:30:32.734 --> 00:30:35.333
We've been streaming
Open Your Thoughts.

637
00:30:35.467 --> 00:30:37.667
Are you familiar
with the program?

638
00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:39.500
No. I don't think so.

639
00:30:39.633 --> 00:30:41.333
It'll transform your life.

640
00:30:41.467 --> 00:30:43.000
Ok. Yeah.

641
00:30:43.133 --> 00:30:44.400
I hope so. I could use it.

642
00:30:44.533 --> 00:30:46.233
But. in the meantime.
once that color appears.

643
00:30:46.367 --> 00:30:47.133
let me know.

644
00:30:47.266 --> 00:30:48.066
- Ok.
- Sure.

645
00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:49.333
- Sounds good.
- Thanks for coming in.

646
00:30:49.467 --> 00:30:50.834
Thanks. Ruthie.

647
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:53.734
I'll get this.

648
00:30:55.066 --> 00:30:55.934
It's just a few...

649
00:30:56.066 --> 00:30:57.266
Luke! I need you.

650
00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:59.233
Soap Monster's gone
haywire again.

651
00:30:59.367 --> 00:31:00.900
Ok. I'm coming.

652
00:31:01.033 --> 00:31:04.400
Excuse me. you two. my services
are required.

653
00:31:04.533 --> 00:31:05.133
- Sure.
- Of course.

654
00:31:05.266 --> 00:31:06.367
I'll get this. like I said.

655
00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:08.200
- Thank you.
- Great. thanks.

656
00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.834
Luke. you're just
making it worse.

657
00:31:15.967 --> 00:31:16.900
Robin. come on.

658
00:31:17.033 --> 00:31:18.166
I'm just trying to diagnose
the issue here.

659
00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.834
Mom? We're backing up
out here.

660
00:31:20.967 --> 00:31:22.500
Ok. well can you diagnose
a little bit faster?

661
00:31:22.633 --> 00:31:23.667
We're running out of
clean dishes.

662
00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.600
Ok. I'm on it.

663
00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.133
Abby.

664
00:31:30.266 --> 00:31:31.000
Hey. Robin.

665
00:31:31.133 --> 00:31:33.033
Hi. Oh. it's so good
to see you.

666
00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:34.867
It's nice to see you too.
I just met Ruthie.

667
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.200
She looks exactly like you did
in high school.

668
00:31:37.333 --> 00:31:38.567
I thought it was you
for a second.

669
00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.500
Well you look amazing.

670
00:31:40.633 --> 00:31:41.633
Oh. well. thank you.
you're very kind.

671
00:31:41.767 --> 00:31:43.200
- You do too.
- Aw. thank you.

672
00:31:43.333 --> 00:31:44.667
Oh hey. Luke is in the kitchen.

673
00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:47.033
I gotta run. but it's really
good to see you.

674
00:31:47.166 --> 00:31:48.567
Nice to see you too.

675
00:31:53.266 --> 00:31:58.066
Oh. dear. You've made quite
the mess back there.

676
00:31:59.266 --> 00:32:02.200
Well I didn't make it.
But I'm gonna fix it.

677
00:32:02.333 --> 00:32:04.066
Hm. You sure about that?

678
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.867
Well. I'm gonna try.

679
00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.900
Want me to take a look?

680
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.300
Ok. be my guest.

681
00:32:11.166 --> 00:32:11.967
Out of my way.

682
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.667
Oh. it's time to get serious.
is it?

683
00:32:18.934 --> 00:32:19.667
You sure it's not in there?

684
00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.133
It's not in there.
It's your float.

685
00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.400
The switch is stuck
and when that happens.

686
00:32:26.533 --> 00:32:30.600
the relay switch won't activate
and this happens.

687
00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.166
There you go.

688
00:32:37.066 --> 00:32:37.867
Ok!

689
00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:38.800
Ooh.

690
00:32:39.567 --> 00:32:40.834
Well. I almost fixed it.

691
00:32:43.233 --> 00:32:46.033
You're just mad because I showed
you up. Mr. Not-So-Fixit.

692
00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.066
So where'd you learn to be
so handy anyway?

693
00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.000
Oh. well. Leo.
I moved home after...

694
00:32:57.734 --> 00:33:00.333
Anyway. Leo was a mechanic

695
00:33:00.467 --> 00:33:02.700
and he taught me everything
I know about machines.

696
00:33:02.834 --> 00:33:05.433
Which is a lot.

697
00:33:05.567 --> 00:33:07.500
Well. you certainly look good
in soap.

698
00:33:07.633 --> 00:33:10.166
Oh. well you're quite
the sud yourself.

699
00:33:11.834 --> 00:33:12.700
Did I just say that?

700
00:33:12.834 --> 00:33:14.033
Yeah. you kind of did.

701
00:33:15.166 --> 00:33:16.300
I could never
"pun" very well.

702
00:33:16.433 --> 00:33:17.667
It's ok.

703
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.400
That could be my office.

704
00:33:21.433 --> 00:33:22.734
Oh. it's Edward.

705
00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:24.667
Hey. babe.

706
00:33:25.433 --> 00:33:26.800
No. I'm not busy.

707
00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:32.200
Edward.

708
00:34:00.834 --> 00:34:02.934
- Hey!
- Hey!

709
00:34:03.066 --> 00:34:04.700
It's good to see you here.

710
00:34:04.834 --> 00:34:07.233
I couldn't miss the end of
summer festival while I'm here.

711
00:34:07.367 --> 00:34:11.433
It was my absolute favorite
thing when I was growing up.

712
00:34:11.567 --> 00:34:12.400
Pie?

713
00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.033
Yes. I never say no to pie.

714
00:34:16.166 --> 00:34:17.567
MmMm.

715
00:34:18.367 --> 00:34:20.000
- That looks good.
- Here you go.

716
00:34:20.133 --> 00:34:22.100
Oh. this is beautiful pie.

717
00:34:25.333 --> 00:34:25.934
It's good.

718
00:34:26.066 --> 00:34:27.767
- Mmhm.
- Mm.

719
00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.900
So. it's a crazy situation
between you and Luke. huh?

720
00:34:33.667 --> 00:34:35.900
Crazy is an understatement.

721
00:34:36.033 --> 00:34:38.367
Well. I guess that makes us
sisters-in-law again.

722
00:34:40.633 --> 00:34:44.100
Yeah. for a few days. anyway.

723
00:34:48.233 --> 00:34:51.233
Is this Ruthie's Status Update.
is that-

724
00:34:51.367 --> 00:34:54.834
Yeah. my daughter
is all about her music.

725
00:34:54.967 --> 00:34:56.166
Such a fun age.

726
00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.767
But. uh right now she is over
volunteering at Luke's booth.

727
00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:00.734
Luke has a booth?

728
00:35:00.867 --> 00:35:02.033
Mmhm. yeah.

729
00:35:02.166 --> 00:35:04.600
It's just out past the Wonders
of Cheese booth on the left.

730
00:35:04.734 --> 00:35:06.033
Can't miss it.

731
00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:08.100
No. no. no. that's ok.
I wasn't...

732
00:35:08.233 --> 00:35:09.433
Oh.

733
00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.166
Except. I was just...

734
00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.133
Mm!

735
00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.233
How're you doing.
Phoebe?

736
00:35:19.367 --> 00:35:24.233
Oh. wow. That looks so good. Beautiful.

737
00:35:24.367 --> 00:35:25.600
Nice job.

738
00:35:25.867 --> 00:35:26.934
How's it going. Travis?

739
00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:28.400
Let's see here. buddy.

740
00:35:28.533 --> 00:35:30.567
Wow! You see. now that's
amazing.

741
00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:32.767
I actually feel a whole lot
better just seeing trees

742
00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:34.200
in the background there.

743
00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:37.834
Hey!

744
00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:45.934
Just walking by.

745
00:35:50.533 --> 00:35:51.834
Luke. I had no idea
your paintings

746
00:35:51.967 --> 00:35:53.233
were so beautiful.

747
00:35:53.367 --> 00:35:54.633
Well. you know I had
a lot of...

748
00:35:54.767 --> 00:35:56.967
lot of free time in Alaska. so...

749
00:35:58.934 --> 00:36:00.700
You want to help?

750
00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.300
- With?
- Yeah.

751
00:36:03.433 --> 00:36:04.200
Sure.

752
00:36:04.333 --> 00:36:05.700
Come on! Everybody.
this is Abby.

753
00:36:05.834 --> 00:36:06.667
Can you guys say hi?

754
00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.867
Hi Abby.

755
00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.433
Hi. everybody.

756
00:36:11.133 --> 00:36:12.467
Oh. see Cecilia.
that's so much better.

757
00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:13.567
These strokes. here.

758
00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.500
That's really cool.
Is that a cat?

759
00:36:16.633 --> 00:36:18.333
That's a good-looking cat.

760
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.834
Looks almost like he has wings
coming up from the side.

761
00:36:21.967 --> 00:36:23.600
It's like a dragon cat.

762
00:36:24.667 --> 00:36:25.700
I like it.

763
00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:32.500
music]

764
00:36:37.333 --> 00:36:40.867
This is a lot of fun.
It's just like I remember.

765
00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.834
Ruthie! I hear your band
is playing at the dance.

766
00:36:43.967 --> 00:36:46.200
We can't wait.
Are you coming?

767
00:36:46.333 --> 00:36:47.667
I wouldn't miss it.

768
00:36:50.433 --> 00:36:52.066
Ruthie! We were looking
all over for you.

769
00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.367
Tyler and the guys
are having a party.

770
00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:54.367
You have to come!

771
00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:56.233
Hello Claire. hello Ashley.

772
00:36:56.367 --> 00:36:57.367
Girls.

773
00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:01.533
Remember. I told you?

774
00:37:01.667 --> 00:37:03.300
Oh. yeah. Hey.

775
00:37:03.433 --> 00:37:04.133
Home by 10:00PM.

776
00:37:05.834 --> 00:37:06.800
Oh!

777
00:37:07.066 --> 00:37:08.633
Well I am spent.

778
00:37:08.767 --> 00:37:11.233
There's a bubble bath and a
glass of wine calling my name.

779
00:37:11.367 --> 00:37:12.033
Well-deserved.

780
00:37:12.166 --> 00:37:12.900
- Enjoy.
- Bye.

781
00:37:13.033 --> 00:37:14.066
See ya.

782
00:37:17.266 --> 00:37:18.266
So...

783
00:37:20.533 --> 00:37:22.500
You uh. you have any.
any plans tonight?

784
00:37:23.667 --> 00:37:25.433
Uh. Leo's going out

785
00:37:25.567 --> 00:37:27.433
so I promised Mom I'd have
dinner with her.

786
00:37:27.567 --> 00:37:29.500
Ah. Right. Of course.

787
00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:32.934
Well. I should probably
close up the booth.

788
00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.867
Have a nice evening.

789
00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.133
Thanks.

790
00:37:40.867 --> 00:37:42.333
Oops! Sorry. bud.

791
00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.467
- You ok?
- Yeah. sure. Why?

792
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.633
I don't know.

793
00:37:54.767 --> 00:37:56.533
You're going at those vegetables
awful aggressively.

794
00:37:56.667 --> 00:37:57.800
That's all.

795
00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:01.066
I guess this whole marriage
business has me a little tense.

796
00:38:02.233 --> 00:38:03.700
- I'm off!
- Oh.

797
00:38:04.667 --> 00:38:06.934
Whatever you do. do not lose
to that judge.

798
00:38:07.066 --> 00:38:10.467
Don't worry.
It's in the bowling bag.

799
00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.500
Oh. whatever.

800
00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:14.967
- Kisses!
- Goodbye.

801
00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:15.500
Muah.

802
00:38:15.633 --> 00:38:16.266
Have fun.

803
00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.367
- Love you guys.
- Love you.

804
00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:18.333
Love you too.

805
00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.767
Why don't you go for a walk?

806
00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:23.700
Go into to town.
get a drink. even.

807
00:38:23.834 --> 00:38:25.300
A bite to eat.
I don't mind.

808
00:38:26.467 --> 00:38:28.367
This was supposed to be
our mother-daughter time.

809
00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.166
Yeah. I know.

810
00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.033
But we'll have that time
in Paris.

811
00:38:31.166 --> 00:38:32.700
We'll go shopping.

812
00:38:33.967 --> 00:38:35.667
Guess a walk could
do me some good.

813
00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:36.800
Yeah.

814
00:38:37.633 --> 00:38:38.467
Ok.

815
00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:40.800
What time do you think
you'll be home?

816
00:38:40.934 --> 00:38:43.633
I don't know Mom. I no longer
have a curfew.

817
00:38:43.767 --> 00:38:45.033
Mmm.

818
00:39:18.133 --> 00:39:19.834
You too!

819
00:39:19.967 --> 00:39:22.600
Oh. hi Ian.
How've you been?

820
00:39:22.734 --> 00:39:24.367
My evening is now complete.

821
00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:28.033
My best waitress has returned
to join my worst dishwasher.

822
00:39:28.166 --> 00:39:30.667
Oh. Oh. no. no. no.
I'm not...

823
00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.367
He refused to order anything
until you arrived.

824
00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:33.633
Not even water.

825
00:39:33.767 --> 00:39:38.667
The best table in the place.
But of course. you remember.

826
00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:41.033
I guess I can stay a minute.

827
00:39:43.667 --> 00:39:45.166
Luke and Abigail.

828
00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:49.000
I can't believe you are here
in my restaurant again.

829
00:39:49.133 --> 00:39:52.433
Let me make something special
for you. please.

830
00:39:52.567 --> 00:39:53.400
Thank you.

831
00:39:54.367 --> 00:39:56.066
That would be wonderful. Ian.
Thank you.

832
00:40:01.166 --> 00:40:02.066
- Hi.
- Hello.

833
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.333
So I guess we had the same
idea. huh?

834
00:40:08.467 --> 00:40:11.367
Yeah. I just wanted to see
if it was still here.

835
00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:13.400
Oh. no it's. it's still here.

836
00:40:13.533 --> 00:40:14.700
And open.

837
00:40:14.834 --> 00:40:17.200
Gonna be honest. this is the
first time I've set foot in here

838
00:40:17.333 --> 00:40:18.934
since I got back from Alaska. so...

839
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.200
Until tonight.

840
00:40:22.734 --> 00:40:24.567
Yeah. until tonight.

841
00:40:29.734 --> 00:40:33.767
It feels really strange
to be sitting here.

842
00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:36.934
I mean. I wonder how many
times I waited on this table.

843
00:40:37.066 --> 00:40:41.233
While I was in the kitchen.
laboring away. cleaning dishes.

844
00:40:41.367 --> 00:40:42.166
Please.

845
00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.700
What?

846
00:40:43.834 --> 00:40:46.233
You did seem to work the same
shift a lot.

847
00:40:46.367 --> 00:40:47.367
Yeah.

848
00:40:49.133 --> 00:40:52.700
I have to confess something.
It wasn't just a coincidence.

849
00:40:52.834 --> 00:40:56.367
You see Ian over there's
a romantic at heart.

850
00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:57.100
Oh.

851
00:40:57.233 --> 00:40:58.600
Hm.

852
00:40:58.734 --> 00:41:00.066
So now I know.

853
00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.934
Well. you know.
Hey. it worked. right?

854
00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.934
I remember being here
one time

855
00:41:06.066 --> 00:41:08.166
until after 2:00AM
in the morning.

856
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:12.000
polishing silverware after one
of your big ideas gone wrong.

857
00:41:12.133 --> 00:41:13.333
Yeah. you're talking
about the time

858
00:41:13.467 --> 00:41:14.467
when I thought it was
a great idea

859
00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.467
to soak silverware in bleach
and sparkling clean.

860
00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:18.300
But instead-

861
00:41:18.433 --> 00:41:19.934
It turned everything
jet black.

862
00:41:23.867 --> 00:41:24.934
- Aye.

863
00:41:27.367 --> 00:41:29.333
But that was the moment
that I knew.

864
00:41:29.467 --> 00:41:30.667
Knew what?

865
00:41:32.567 --> 00:41:34.667
You were the one.

866
00:41:37.033 --> 00:41:39.934
Why? Because I helped you
out of a mess?

867
00:41:40.066 --> 00:41:42.133
No. Abby.

868
00:41:42.266 --> 00:41:45.266
Because you helped me out of a
mess because you cared about me.

869
00:41:47.133 --> 00:41:48.867
Your favorite.

870
00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:49.900
Oh. no!

871
00:41:50.033 --> 00:41:51.600
Ah! Crisis!

872
00:41:54.433 --> 00:41:55.300
Wow.

873
00:41:55.433 --> 00:41:56.967
Well. at least they didn't
bring out two.

874
00:41:57.100 --> 00:42:00.533
I'll let you be the judge.

875
00:42:08.166 --> 00:42:09.734
What's he like. Abby?

876
00:42:10.834 --> 00:42:13.033
The guy you're marrying.

877
00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:20.066
- Edward.
- Hm.

878
00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:23.400
He's good and kind.
He's so smart.

879
00:42:23.533 --> 00:42:27.033
He's just a really solid guy.

880
00:42:30.367 --> 00:42:32.333
And he loves me.

881
00:42:35.033 --> 00:42:36.567
We're good together.

882
00:42:37.367 --> 00:42:38.834
So were we.

883
00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:42.033
Don't do this. Luke.

884
00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.433
And that would be...

885
00:42:46.333 --> 00:42:47.300
Get your hopes up

886
00:42:47.433 --> 00:42:50.266
that we're gonna be anything
more than friends.

887
00:42:54.266 --> 00:42:55.066
Bite?

888
00:42:55.834 --> 00:42:58.834
This thing's huge. Ok. um...

889
00:43:08.667 --> 00:43:11.467
That was the best caramel
cookie crunch

890
00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:12.734
I have ever had.

891
00:43:13.767 --> 00:43:14.633
I know. it was amazing.

892
00:43:14.767 --> 00:43:16.033
Ian is some kind of genius.

893
00:43:16.166 --> 00:43:18.133
Mm. It was so good.

894
00:43:18.266 --> 00:43:20.400
Hey. do you remember when
we used to sneak a scoop

895
00:43:20.533 --> 00:43:22.700
when Ian turned his back. remember?

896
00:43:22.834 --> 00:43:24.600
- Sneak!
- Yeah.

897
00:43:24.734 --> 00:43:27.033
- He knew.
- You think?

898
00:43:27.166 --> 00:43:29.100
Those scoops were instead
of an end of summer bonus.

899
00:43:29.233 --> 00:43:31.100
Oh. well.
You might be right.

900
00:43:33.433 --> 00:43:35.166
- Oh.
- Wow.

901
00:43:37.367 --> 00:43:39.633
Remember in high school
when we'd meet here at night?

902
00:43:39.767 --> 00:43:40.767
Mmm.

903
00:43:41.433 --> 00:43:44.100
Start it up when
no one was around.

904
00:43:44.233 --> 00:43:45.967
I do remember that. yeah.

905
00:43:47.667 --> 00:43:49.066
We never got caught either.
did we?

906
00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:50.166
No.

907
00:43:53.834 --> 00:43:54.633
What?

908
00:43:56.333 --> 00:43:57.400
Are you serious?

909
00:43:57.533 --> 00:43:58.934
Come on. after all the ice cream
we just had. you want...?

910
00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:01.867
Ok. you're on. One ride.

911
00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.667
- Yes!
- Let's go. Alright.

912
00:44:05.967 --> 00:44:06.800
Ok.

913
00:44:07.166 --> 00:44:07.934
You good?

914
00:44:08.066 --> 00:44:09.567
- Hurry. hurry. hurry. hurry!
- Alright.

915
00:44:15.567 --> 00:44:16.633
Here we go.

916
00:44:17.667 --> 00:44:20.166
I can't believe I let you
talk me into this.

917
00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.367
I think you're the one
who did all the talking.

918
00:44:30.967 --> 00:44:32.667
Bring back good memories?

919
00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:35.700
I didn't think I'd miss home
as much as I do.

920
00:44:59.467 --> 00:45:02.567
- You alright?
- Yeah. it was fun.

921
00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.467
Here. let me. let me help you.

922
00:45:09.633 --> 00:45:10.600
Yeah.

923
00:45:17.834 --> 00:45:19.433
We should go. We don't
want to get caught.

924
00:45:21.333 --> 00:45:23.400
Well. I'm not hurting anything.

925
00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.734
I think it's best we leave.

926
00:45:28.834 --> 00:45:30.567
Ok. I mean. ok.
I'll walk you home.

927
00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:32.934
It's. uh. it's ok.
I know the way.

928
00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:34.967
Right.

929
00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:44.133
Luke. what did you expect
from all this?

930
00:45:47.367 --> 00:45:49.200
I have no idea.

931
00:45:52.333 --> 00:45:53.734
Are you sure?

932
00:45:55.467 --> 00:45:57.467
Are you sure about Edward?

933
00:46:01.934 --> 00:46:03.533
Yeah. I'm sure.

934
00:46:08.233 --> 00:46:10.033
- Good night.
- Yeah. good night.

935
00:46:28.967 --> 00:46:32.433
Abby. it's late.
Where have you been?

936
00:46:32.567 --> 00:46:34.934
Mom. please.
I'm not 17 anymore.

937
00:46:35.066 --> 00:46:36.767
Well. I know you're not
17 anymore.

938
00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:38.767
but you are still engaged.

939
00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.233
You don't need to remind me
of that.

940
00:46:40.367 --> 00:46:41.300
Well...

941
00:46:41.433 --> 00:46:42.700
I was just out with Luke.

942
00:46:43.133 --> 00:46:44.500
Mom. come on.
I'm so tired.

943
00:46:44.633 --> 00:46:46.567
Can we please do whatever
this is in the morning?

944
00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:47.667
No. We can't.

945
00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:51.600
Ok. then what do you
want to say to me?

946
00:46:51.734 --> 00:46:52.934
Why are you acting
so strangely?

947
00:46:53.066 --> 00:46:56.166
Have you ever kept a secret
for so long that it just starts

948
00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:58.300
to eat away at
your conscience?

949
00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:59.633
Just say what you want to say

950
00:46:59.767 --> 00:47:00.667
You're a beautiful woman...

951
00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:01.767
Mom!

952
00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:06.000
I'm the reason
that Luke left you.

953
00:47:06.767 --> 00:47:09.467
When the acceptance letter came
from Princeton.

954
00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:12.900
I went to him and I told him
that if he didn't leave you

955
00:47:13.033 --> 00:47:15.200
that he would ruin your life.

956
00:47:15.333 --> 00:47:17.200
Blow your big chance.

957
00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:23.333
Abigail! Where are you going?

958
00:47:24.467 --> 00:47:26.367
I can't believe you kept this
from me.

959
00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:28.033
This is big. Mom.

960
00:47:28.166 --> 00:47:29.066
Huge!

961
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.300
You told Luke to leave me.

962
00:47:31.433 --> 00:47:33.467
How am I supposed to wrap
my head around that?

963
00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:35.133
Luke made that decision
on his own.

964
00:47:35.266 --> 00:47:37.000
I just nudged him
in that direction.

965
00:47:37.133 --> 00:47:41.033
Abby. he was thinking of you.
He did it for you.

966
00:47:41.166 --> 00:47:43.967
Listen. when that acceptance
letter came from Princeton.

967
00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:46.467
I got to the mailbox first.

968
00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:49.867
And I opened it and I read it
and I was just so proud of you.

969
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:50.900
and then I just sealed it up

970
00:47:51.033 --> 00:47:53.166
and put it back so that
you wouldn't know.

971
00:47:53.300 --> 00:47:54.500
I know it was wrong.

972
00:47:54.633 --> 00:47:55.767
Did Leo know about this
all this time?

973
00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:59.800
No. No. I just told him and
he's as shocked as you are.

974
00:47:59.934 --> 00:48:02.066
No wonder Luke hasn't signed
the decree.

975
00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:05.767
He's still dealing
with what happened.

976
00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:08.633
How could you keep this
from me all these years?

977
00:48:08.767 --> 00:48:11.533
I didn't think you'd ever
forgive me. Abby.

978
00:48:11.667 --> 00:48:14.100
But you have to know.
that I did it for you.

979
00:48:14.233 --> 00:48:16.467
I thought it was what was best
for both of you.

980
00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.200
That wasn't your decision
to make!

981
00:48:18.333 --> 00:48:20.200
Well. I know that now.

982
00:48:20.333 --> 00:48:22.100
But everything worked out
for you. didn't it?

983
00:48:22.233 --> 00:48:23.867
I mean. you have a job
you love.

984
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.467
a wonderful man you're about
to marry.

985
00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:26.400
Paris.

986
00:48:26.533 --> 00:48:28.200
The ends justify the means.

987
00:48:31.266 --> 00:48:35.767
I need time to process this.
Please give me that.

988
00:48:36.367 --> 00:48:37.567
Where are you going?

989
00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.166
To see my husband.

990
00:48:47.333 --> 00:48:49.266
When did you get
into stargazing?

991
00:48:53.333 --> 00:48:55.934
Oh. I'd say. when I was
in Alaska.

992
00:48:57.834 --> 00:48:59.600
They've got some pretty
incredible night skies there

993
00:48:59.734 --> 00:49:02.767
that the shooting stars
are like fireworks.

994
00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:06.700
I do my best thinking
under the stars. so...

995
00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:10.000
Luke. Mom told
me everything.

996
00:49:10.133 --> 00:49:12.333
About how she convinced you
to give up our marriage

997
00:49:12.467 --> 00:49:14.633
so I could go to Princeton.

998
00:49:14.767 --> 00:49:18.734
And how you've been carrying
this secret all those years.

999
00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:21.967
So you finally know.

1000
00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:26.333
What I don't know is why.

1001
00:49:26.467 --> 00:49:29.300
Why didn't you even talk
to me about it?

1002
00:49:29.433 --> 00:49:31.300
Maybe we could have
had it all.

1003
00:49:31.433 --> 00:49:34.467
Maybe it could have been
you and me heading to Paris.

1004
00:49:34.600 --> 00:49:36.100
But it's not.
is it. Abby?

1005
00:49:36.233 --> 00:49:37.166
It's not.

1006
00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.300
And it's too late.

1007
00:49:38.433 --> 00:49:39.433
Let's just face this
for a second.

1008
00:49:39.567 --> 00:49:40.967
If I'd have come to you
and told you

1009
00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:42.333
exactly what your mother told me
back then.

1010
00:49:42.467 --> 00:49:43.633
you'd have taken that
Princeton letter.

1011
00:49:43.767 --> 00:49:46.333
you'd have ripped it in half
because you would have chosen us

1012
00:49:46.467 --> 00:49:48.433
and I couldn't allow you to
throw your future away on me.

1013
00:49:48.567 --> 00:49:50.367
Because you weren't worth it?

1014
00:49:51.166 --> 00:49:53.500
No. I mean. I was different
back then. sure.

1015
00:49:53.633 --> 00:49:54.800
I mean I didn't have
as much.

1016
00:49:54.934 --> 00:49:57.500
I didn't have any
self-confidence. really.

1017
00:49:57.633 --> 00:49:59.166
And now?

1018
00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:01.200
Abby. you got the life
you wanted.

1019
00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:02.767
And deserved.

1020
00:50:02.900 --> 00:50:04.800
It's just unfortunate
it's not here with me.

1021
00:50:04.934 --> 00:50:08.200
Is that... is that how
you think love works?

1022
00:50:08.333 --> 00:50:12.233
That a little challenge arises
and you just cut and run?

1023
00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.600
Was it hard leaving me?

1024
00:50:22.300 --> 00:50:25.066
It was the hardest thing
I've ever done.

1025
00:50:25.734 --> 00:50:27.567
I think I've seen enough stars
for one night.

1026
00:50:27.967 --> 00:50:28.800
Luke...

1027
00:50:30.567 --> 00:50:32.767
What do I do with
this knowledge?

1028
00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:34.033
What now?

1029
00:50:34.166 --> 00:50:35.600
It's just up to you. Abby.
I don't know.

1030
00:50:35.734 --> 00:50:37.767
But I'm so relieved that
you finally know the truth.

1031
00:50:46.266 --> 00:50:48.333
Did you ever think about me?

1032
00:50:48.767 --> 00:50:50.200
When you were looking up
at the skies.

1033
00:50:50.333 --> 00:50:52.467
did you think about us?

1034
00:50:54.066 --> 00:50:56.133
Uh. every single night.

1035
00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:20.200
You sure this garden party's
the right thing right now?

1036
00:51:20.333 --> 00:51:23.500
I hurt Abby and I want to do
something nice for her

1037
00:51:23.633 --> 00:51:26.233
and it's my week to host
the book club

1038
00:51:26.367 --> 00:51:29.133
and the bookies are happy
to help me celebrate Abby.

1039
00:51:29.266 --> 00:51:30.333
I still think it's a bad idea.

1040
00:51:30.467 --> 00:51:31.533
It's just a book club meeting.

1041
00:51:31.667 --> 00:51:34.333
That's French-themed with Abby
as the guest of honor

1042
00:51:34.467 --> 00:51:35.834
right when she's learning
how to deal

1043
00:51:35.967 --> 00:51:37.734
with this huge secret
in her life.

1044
00:51:37.867 --> 00:51:39.967
Well. I'm the mother of
the bride and I have the right

1045
00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.900
to celebrate my soon-to-be
wed daughter if I want.

1046
00:51:43.033 --> 00:51:45.400
And besides. the girls
are really looking forward

1047
00:51:45.533 --> 00:51:46.867
to seeing her before
the wedding.

1048
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:47.967
You should tell her.

1049
00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:51.200
Well then it wouldn't be
a surprise now. would it?

1050
00:51:54.133 --> 00:51:55.633
I'm off to the Robin's Nest.

1051
00:51:55.767 --> 00:51:59.333
I washed up your old bike
if you want to use it.

1052
00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:01.734
Thanks.

1053
00:52:02.066 --> 00:52:04.767
Who are you meeting
at the restaurant?

1054
00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:05.900
Luke.

1055
00:52:07.066 --> 00:52:09.667
- We're renewing our vows.
- Uh...

1056
00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:12.233
I'm joking. Mom.

1057
00:52:12.367 --> 00:52:16.367
I'm going for coffee on my bike.
thanks to Leo.

1058
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:18.967
Well what are your plans
for this evening?

1059
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:22.734
I thought I would go to
the dance at the fairgrounds.

1060
00:52:22.867 --> 00:52:23.734
Ruthie's band is playing.

1061
00:52:23.867 --> 00:52:25.767
Oh. well. we were thinking
of having dinner

1062
00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:28.300
all together tonight.
early dinner.

1063
00:52:29.934 --> 00:52:32.900
- Sure. See ya later.

1064
00:52:35.333 --> 00:52:39.433
Love. perfectly bad idea.

1065
00:53:17.233 --> 00:53:19.600
Edward. I have so much
to tell you.

1066
00:53:19.734 --> 00:53:21.500
We can talk it all out
when I get back.

1067
00:53:21.633 --> 00:53:22.533
Can't wait.

1068
00:53:22.667 --> 00:53:24.300
Tonight I'm gonna go see
Ruthie's band play.

1069
00:53:24.433 --> 00:53:26.200
Will your husband be there?

1070
00:53:26.333 --> 00:53:27.700
Edward. stop.

1071
00:53:27.834 --> 00:53:29.100
Yeah. I'm just teasing.

1072
00:53:29.233 --> 00:53:30.867
So. how's that going anyway?

1073
00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:33.266
Well. he still hasn't
signed yet.

1074
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.300
I think he's just
being stubborn.

1075
00:53:35.433 --> 00:53:37.200
I'm sure he will on Monday.

1076
00:53:37.333 --> 00:53:39.934
I need to get coffee.
I'll call you later. ok?

1077
00:53:40.066 --> 00:53:41.767
Yep. Just text me
before bedtime.

1078
00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.266
Alright. Will do.

1079
00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.467
- Love you. bye.
- Bye.

1080
00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.266
- Morning. Abby.
- Good morning.

1081
00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:01.066
- Coffee?
- Yes. please.

1082
00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:19.533
- Oh hey.
- Hi.

1083
00:54:19.667 --> 00:54:20.600
Would you like to sit down?

1084
00:54:20.734 --> 00:54:22.200
Oh. no. no. I don't want
to disturb your work.

1085
00:54:22.333 --> 00:54:23.533
Oh no. you're not doing anything.

1086
00:54:23.667 --> 00:54:24.700
No. it's just...
this is nothing.

1087
00:54:24.834 --> 00:54:26.367
I'm actually just waiting
for a couple clients is all.

1088
00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:28.033
Yeah. they're a little
high maintenance sell.

1089
00:54:28.166 --> 00:54:30.200
so I figured I'd caffeine up.

1090
00:54:30.333 --> 00:54:35.600
Oh. are they as bad as I was
when we lived in that apartment

1091
00:54:35.734 --> 00:54:38.200
over the autobody shop?

1092
00:54:38.333 --> 00:54:41.033
Oh. close. close.

1093
00:54:41.166 --> 00:54:43.700
No. didn't you make me repaint
the living room

1094
00:54:43.834 --> 00:54:46.433
like four times or something?

1095
00:54:46.567 --> 00:54:50.066
Well. I mean... It was hard
to get the right tone.

1096
00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:51.500
Right. Right.

1097
00:54:51.633 --> 00:54:53.233
I like to just think
that you were training me

1098
00:54:53.367 --> 00:54:54.700
for how to handle
my future business.

1099
00:54:54.834 --> 00:54:55.500
Well then you're welcome.

1100
00:54:55.633 --> 00:54:57.066
Thank you.
Oh. there they are.

1101
00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:57.934
Oh. I'll move.

1102
00:54:58.066 --> 00:54:58.800
No. no. it's fine.

1103
00:54:58.934 --> 00:55:00.166
No need to move.
we're not staying.

1104
00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:01.900
Luke. we just wanted
to let you know

1105
00:55:02.033 --> 00:55:03.934
that while a color
did manifest itself-

1106
00:55:04.066 --> 00:55:04.934
Mmhm.

1107
00:55:05.066 --> 00:55:06.667
We've decided to go
in a new direction.

1108
00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.066
Oh. ok.

1109
00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:09.633
Well. why don't you just
tell me the new color

1110
00:55:09.767 --> 00:55:10.433
and we'll take it-

1111
00:55:10.567 --> 00:55:12.300
A totally new direction.

1112
00:55:12.433 --> 00:55:13.567
Dan Crocker said he could
do the job

1113
00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:16.233
for 10-percent less
than your bid.

1114
00:55:16.367 --> 00:55:18.166
It's nothing personal.
it's only business.

1115
00:55:18.300 --> 00:55:19.767
Right. no. I understand.

1116
00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:21.233
Ok. well. thank you
for letting me know...

1117
00:55:21.367 --> 00:55:22.433
No. no.

1118
00:55:22.567 --> 00:55:24.900
No. no. no.
Not happening.

1119
00:55:25.033 --> 00:55:26.433
And you are?

1120
00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:29.266
Mr. Walker's attorney.

1121
00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:31.734
Did you sign a contract
with my client?

1122
00:55:31.867 --> 00:55:32.834
Well. yes. but...

1123
00:55:32.967 --> 00:55:34.967
And do you have any idea
how many jobs my client

1124
00:55:35.100 --> 00:55:38.934
has turned down because he's
contracted to paint your house?

1125
00:55:39.066 --> 00:55:40.133
Well. no. but...

1126
00:55:40.266 --> 00:55:41.433
That's ok.

1127
00:55:41.567 --> 00:55:43.333
I'll let you know when I get
you under oath in deposition.

1128
00:55:45.266 --> 00:55:47.266
- We don't really want that.
- No.

1129
00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.367
No. that sounds unpleasant.

1130
00:55:51.367 --> 00:55:54.533
So. do you have something
you'd like to say to my client?

1131
00:55:55.600 --> 00:55:56.500
Um...

1132
00:55:59.533 --> 00:56:01.500
You can start on Tuesday.

1133
00:56:01.633 --> 00:56:02.867
Mmhm.

1134
00:56:03.867 --> 00:56:05.500
We'll see you then. guys. Thanks.

1135
00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:10.667
Abby...

1136
00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:12.700
You didn't have
to say that.

1137
00:56:12.834 --> 00:56:15.867
We always used to stick up
for each other. remember?

1138
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.400
- I do.
- And that felt good.

1139
00:56:18.533 --> 00:56:19.767
I bet it did.

1140
00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:21.700
They'll be very happy
they stuck with you.

1141
00:56:21.834 --> 00:56:22.700
Mmm.

1142
00:56:22.834 --> 00:56:25.133
The one thing we now need
to sort out is.

1143
00:56:25.266 --> 00:56:28.567
um. my commission
or my attorney's fees.

1144
00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.567
Yeah. I'll have to make
a note of it.

1145
00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:31.900
Mmhm.

1146
00:56:32.033 --> 00:56:33.867
But the real question here is.
how is Judge Perkins gonna react

1147
00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
when he finds out that
you're posing as an attorney?

1148
00:56:36.133 --> 00:56:36.967
Oh. that guy.

1149
00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:37.734
Yeah.

1150
00:56:37.867 --> 00:56:39.166
Here you go.

1151
00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:42.133
On the house in honor of
your upcoming marriage.

1152
00:56:47.367 --> 00:56:48.567
Thanks. Robin.

1153
00:56:50.667 --> 00:56:52.900
I'm gonna head off.

1154
00:56:53.033 --> 00:56:53.734
I'll walk you out.

1155
00:56:53.867 --> 00:56:55.133
- Mm.
- Yeah.

1156
00:56:55.266 --> 00:56:57.166
Okey-doke. Thank you.

1157
00:56:57.300 --> 00:56:58.567
I want to make sure you.
make sure you.

1158
00:56:58.700 --> 00:56:59.633
you know. put on your helmet.

1159
00:56:59.767 --> 00:57:01.600
- Safety first.
- Safety first.

1160
00:57:04.333 --> 00:57:07.233
Everything seems
so much smaller.

1161
00:57:08.233 --> 00:57:09.567
Yeah. I agree.

1162
00:57:09.700 --> 00:57:11.700
I felt the same way when
I returned from Alaska.

1163
00:57:11.834 --> 00:57:13.233
It was like I had a
different perspective.

1164
00:57:13.367 --> 00:57:15.934
It's like time stood still.

1165
00:57:16.066 --> 00:57:19.066
But it doesn't. does it?

1166
00:57:21.033 --> 00:57:22.300
It doesn't.

1167
00:57:23.934 --> 00:57:30.200
You know what I remember most
about my life here is... you.

1168
00:57:32.166 --> 00:57:37.266
You know. before we were us.
we were friends.

1169
00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:40.000
- We were best friends.
- Yeah.

1170
00:57:40.700 --> 00:57:42.667
And like today. you always
stood up for me.

1171
00:57:43.533 --> 00:57:44.800
Of course.

1172
00:57:46.367 --> 00:57:49.533
But I do remember running
against you

1173
00:57:49.667 --> 00:57:52.133
for student council president
in 6th grade.

1174
00:57:52.266 --> 00:57:54.900
- Yes. Yep.

1175
00:57:55.033 --> 00:57:55.934
Uh-huh.

1176
00:57:56.066 --> 00:57:57.300
I remember that.

1177
00:57:57.433 --> 00:57:59.600
But when I had to pick
a campaign manager

1178
00:57:59.734 --> 00:58:01.500
to introduce me
and say nice things.

1179
00:58:01.633 --> 00:58:04.033
Mr. Wilkins told me to pick
the student I trusted most.

1180
00:58:04.166 --> 00:58:05.567
it was you.

1181
00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.433
- What?

1182
00:58:09.567 --> 00:58:15.433
I still remember what you
said when you introduced me.

1183
00:58:15.567 --> 00:58:19.633
"I'd trust Abby Foster
with my Star Wars lunch box.

1184
00:58:19.767 --> 00:58:22.500
"Even if there was a double
fudge brownie inside it."

1185
00:58:22.633 --> 00:58:24.867
Yeah. I did say that.
I did.

1186
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.867
Unfortunately. I think
that joke fell flat.

1187
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.567
I don't know. I beat you
by five votes.

1188
00:58:30.834 --> 00:58:32.533
One of those votes
was mine.

1189
00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:37.033
- Really?
- Yeah.

1190
00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:45.400
You're the best friend
I ever had.

1191
00:58:48.567 --> 00:58:49.767
I'm gonna go now.

1192
00:58:49.900 --> 00:58:50.900
Hm.

1193
00:58:51.033 --> 00:58:52.233
I have a few things I need
to do and I promised Mom

1194
00:58:52.367 --> 00:58:54.700
I'd have an early dinner with
them before the dance tonight.

1195
00:58:54.834 --> 00:58:55.700
Alright.

1196
00:58:55.834 --> 00:58:58.834
So. um. will you be there later?

1197
00:58:59.934 --> 00:59:01.200
Wouldn't miss it.

1198
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:02.800
Alright.

1199
00:59:05.333 --> 00:59:06.900
- So...
- I am going to go.

1200
00:59:07.033 --> 00:59:08.600
Ok. I will see you tonight.

1201
00:59:10.166 --> 00:59:11.100
That works.

1202
00:59:11.533 --> 00:59:12.700
Backing up.

1203
00:59:13.166 --> 00:59:14.600
- Oh. and Abby?
- Yeah?

1204
00:59:15.667 --> 00:59:17.400
Don't forget the helmet.

1205
00:59:17.533 --> 00:59:20.333
Ah. thank you.
Captain Safety.

1206
00:59:20.467 --> 00:59:21.700
You are welcome.

1207
00:59:24.133 --> 00:59:26.467
Abby. your helmet's
on backwards.

1208
00:59:27.533 --> 00:59:29.400
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so?

1209
00:59:29.533 --> 00:59:30.600
Feels right.

1210
00:59:32.166 --> 00:59:33.233
Looks good either way.

1211
00:59:33.734 --> 00:59:35.066
Thank you!

1212
00:59:36.667 --> 00:59:38.500
- Ding-ding!
- Ding-ding!

1213
01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:07.600
Surprise!

1214
01:00:13.667 --> 01:00:16.300
This was so hard to keep secret. right?

1215
01:00:16.433 --> 01:00:17.367
Hello everyone.

1216
01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:18.867
Now. come over here.

1217
01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.233
This is the sofa
for the bride of honor.

1218
01:00:21.367 --> 01:00:22.500
You sit right here
in the middle.

1219
01:00:22.633 --> 01:00:23.600
Wow.

1220
01:00:23.734 --> 01:00:25.867
The bookies wanted to do
something special for you

1221
01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.867
before you were whisked off
to Paris.

1222
01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.333
And as you can see.
it is French-themed.

1223
01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:33.667
Thank you.

1224
01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:36.500
Oh. and where's Leo?
Where is that man?

1225
01:00:36.800 --> 01:00:37.867
Oh. Leo! Leo. honey.

1226
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.500
Did you check
on the mini croissants?

1227
01:00:39.633 --> 01:00:41.667
Oh. I already ate those.

1228
01:00:42.033 --> 01:00:43.033
Seriously?

1229
01:00:43.166 --> 01:00:44.867
I'm on it. I'm on it.
I'm on it!

1230
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.533
Go. go! Go. Leo. go!

1231
01:00:46.967 --> 01:00:48.066
Oh. that man is too much.

1232
01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.700
Now. Abby. tell us.
were you surprised?

1233
01:00:50.834 --> 01:00:52.066
Sure was.

1234
01:00:53.333 --> 01:00:55.500
Oh. we did it!
I knew it!

1235
01:00:55.633 --> 01:00:57.800
Let's see what the girls
gave you! Open up.

1236
01:00:57.934 --> 01:01:02.100
Sure. Um. I can reach this one.
Let's see.

1237
01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:05.934
Oh. a little wine
and cheese in Paris.

1238
01:01:06.066 --> 01:01:07.500
Oui.

1239
01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.900
- Nice. what's in this one?
- Let's see.

1240
01:01:14.233 --> 01:01:16.800
Help. S'il vous plait.

1241
01:01:19.066 --> 01:01:22.233
Ulgh. Why didn't you warn me?

1242
01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:27.266
Your mother would have banished
me to the couch for a month

1243
01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.467
if I'd uttered a word.

1244
01:01:33.033 --> 01:01:36.433
They made me an honorary bookie.

1245
01:01:38.166 --> 01:01:40.066
Welcome to the club.

1246
01:01:43.433 --> 01:01:45.734
Ruthie's band is playing
at the dance

1247
01:01:45.867 --> 01:01:48.066
and I need a favor.

1248
01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.333
Cover for ya.

1249
01:01:50.533 --> 01:01:54.767
Thank you. Thank you.

1250
01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:56.233
Be good.

1251
01:02:29.467 --> 01:02:31.467
- I made it.
- Oh. Just in time.

1252
01:02:37.133 --> 01:02:40.166
- Hey. about time.
- Traffic.

1253
01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.967
Poplar traffic?

1254
01:02:45.100 --> 01:02:46.166
I need to get a better angle.

1255
01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.467
- Yeah.
- Ok.

1256
01:02:57.233 --> 01:02:58.667
Do you think we would have
made it?

1257
01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:02.400
If we stayed together
back then?

1258
01:03:05.734 --> 01:03:08.200
Well. I may be naive. but...

1259
01:03:11.467 --> 01:03:13.900
I always believed in
our forever.

1260
01:03:16.033 --> 01:03:18.033
It's never too late
to believe again.

1261
01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:21.100

Edward. hi. I didn't. uh.
know you were coming.

1293
01:05:20.533 --> 01:05:22.967
I wanted to surprise you.

1294
01:05:23.100 --> 01:05:24.000
Stopped by your house

1295
01:05:24.133 --> 01:05:27.700
but there's a garden party
going on. so...

1296
01:05:27.834 --> 01:05:29.834
Leo told me you were here.

1297
01:05:30.867 --> 01:05:33.900
- You must be Luke?
- Yeah.

1298
01:05:34.033 --> 01:05:35.033
Edward.

1299
01:05:36.133 --> 01:05:37.433
Abby's fiancé.

1300
01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Hello.

1301
01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:45.000
I'm... I'm sorry to interrupt.

1302
01:05:45.133 --> 01:05:45.900
Oh... No. no.

1303
01:05:46.033 --> 01:05:46.800
It's fine. Edward.

1304
01:05:46.934 --> 01:05:49.700
Actually I was...
I was just leaving.

1305
01:05:52.166 --> 01:05:54.000
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure.

1306
01:05:55.967 --> 01:05:57.533
You're a very lucky man.

1307
01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.834
Thanks for the dance. Abby.

1308
01:06:02.667 --> 01:06:04.000
Excuse me.

1309
01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:15.300
- Wow. I met the famous Luke.
- Yeah.

1310
01:06:15.433 --> 01:06:19.867
Abby... If you have
unfinished business.

1311
01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.800
you should take care of it.

1312
01:06:26.533 --> 01:06:28.600
I will be right back.
I promise.

1313
01:06:28.734 --> 01:06:29.934
Mmmhmm.

1314
01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:33.500
Luke. wait!

1315
01:06:34.934 --> 01:06:36.800
No. Abby look. it's fine.
Listen. just. it's fine.

1316
01:06:36.934 --> 01:06:39.433
Just go back to your fiancé.

1317
01:06:39.567 --> 01:06:40.500
Look at him.
he's waiting for you

1318
01:06:40.633 --> 01:06:42.400
and to be honest I have
nothing left to say.

1319
01:06:42.533 --> 01:06:43.967
Well I might have something
to say to you.

1320
01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.367
did you ever think about that?

1321
01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:48.200
What's the point. Abby?
Our time has passed.

1322
01:06:48.333 --> 01:06:49.400
- Luke...
- You know what?

1323
01:06:49.533 --> 01:06:50.934
You have nothing to worry
about 'cause I'll go in there.

1324
01:06:51.066 --> 01:06:51.900
I'll talk to the judge myself.

1325
01:06:52.033 --> 01:06:53.066
So you know. give her
what she wants.

1326
01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:54.333
Give her the divorce.

1327
01:06:54.467 --> 01:06:55.967
'Cause we both know that's
exactly what you want. right?

1328
01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:58.967
Oh. how dare you play
the victim!

1329
01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:00.800
You're the one who left me.

1330
01:07:00.934 --> 01:07:03.800
I know the reason now.
but still.

1331
01:07:03.934 --> 01:07:09.000
I was 18-years-old and I
loved you with all my heart.

1332
01:07:09.133 --> 01:07:12.600
You left me without
any explanation.

1333
01:07:12.734 --> 01:07:16.433
You have no idea how much
that hurt me. No idea.

1334
01:07:16.567 --> 01:07:18.367
Abby. answer me one question.

1335
01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.433
Do you still have feelings
for me?

1336
01:07:21.567 --> 01:07:23.900
Yes or no? Simple answer.

1337
01:07:34.133 --> 01:07:37.333
It's ok. You've already chosen.

1338
01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.567
See you in court on Monday. Abby.

1339
01:07:51.433 --> 01:07:53.000
I guess we need to talk.

1340
01:07:55.233 --> 01:07:56.200
Yeah.

1341
01:08:00.967 --> 01:08:03.934
sic]

1342
01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:09.834
I bet you wish I hadn't come.
don't ya?

1343
01:08:09.967 --> 01:08:13.400
No. No. Edward.

1344
01:08:13.533 --> 01:08:19.500
I. uh. I think all this was
just a little unexpected.

1345
01:08:19.633 --> 01:08:20.834
Well. I missed you.

1346
01:08:29.367 --> 01:08:30.166
Edward...

1347
01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:32.767
Just. let me. Please.

1348
01:08:35.834 --> 01:08:40.567
Abby. I... I loved you
since I first met you.

1349
01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:46.166
And that love has um. only
grown the more I knew you.

1350
01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:54.400
You're this amazing. smart.
funny. incredible woman.

1351
01:08:54.533 --> 01:08:58.367
You are the woman I want to
marry and spend my life with.

1352
01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.400
But none of that matters

1353
01:09:00.533 --> 01:09:02.934
if I don't have 100 percent
of you.

1354
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:10.300
Ninety-nine won't do.
I deserve all of you.

1355
01:09:10.433 --> 01:09:12.467
Your whole heart.

1356
01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:16.633
- You're such a good man.
- I know.

1357
01:09:20.734 --> 01:09:23.633
But you're right.

1358
01:09:23.767 --> 01:09:27.767
You deserve so much more
than I can give you.

1359
01:09:52.266 --> 01:09:54.066
I'm so sorry.

1360
01:10:00.667 --> 01:10:02.433
I'll miss you. Abby.

1361
01:10:16.934 --> 01:10:20.467
Abby is never going to forgive
me for what I did.

1362
01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.867
You know that isn't true.

1363
01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.200
Then why did she just leave
a party

1364
01:10:24.333 --> 01:10:26.500
I held for her in her honor?

1365
01:10:28.166 --> 01:10:31.233
This isn't about you.

1366
01:10:34.166 --> 01:10:38.100
Well. it serves me right for
interfering all those years ago

1367
01:10:38.233 --> 01:10:40.700
and assuming I knew best.

1368
01:10:40.834 --> 01:10:46.433
I think that we all need to
learn to stay out of the way

1369
01:10:46.567 --> 01:10:49.734
and let love run its course.

1370
01:10:49.867 --> 01:10:51.567
Well. do you forgive me?

1371
01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:54.734
For keeping it from you
all these years.

1372
01:10:54.867 --> 01:11:04.834
The thing is. anger fades fast
but love stays forever.

1373
01:11:07.467 --> 01:11:10.300
Thank you. honey.
Thank you.

1374
01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:15.700
Oh.

1375
01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:19.500
I'm sorry I ran out on you.

1376
01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:24.633
Oh. um. I'm just gonna
head outside

1377
01:11:24.767 --> 01:11:28.133
and check to see if I left
anything on the table. Ok?

1378
01:11:34.233 --> 01:11:38.834
We all make mistakes
and when we do.

1379
01:11:38.967 --> 01:11:47.400
forgiveness is what keeps
family. family. ok?

1380
01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.633
Abigail. I never should have
surprised you

1381
01:11:57.767 --> 01:11:59.433
with that silly party.

1382
01:11:59.567 --> 01:12:01.400
No. Mom. it was sweet of you

1383
01:12:01.533 --> 01:12:05.000
and I'm sorry I ran out
on the bookies.

1384
01:12:05.133 --> 01:12:08.567
Well. the croissants
were delicious.

1385
01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.000
They were very flaky.
it was really...

1386
01:12:10.133 --> 01:12:10.934
Mom.

1387
01:12:12.333 --> 01:12:14.433
Edward and I broke up.

1388
01:12:14.567 --> 01:12:15.700
Oh.

1389
01:12:17.533 --> 01:12:20.233
Luke and I were happy. Mom.

1390
01:12:20.367 --> 01:12:24.900
I know we were young but
we loved each other so much.

1391
01:12:25.033 --> 01:12:27.000
We had plans.

1392
01:12:27.133 --> 01:12:32.367
I thought Luke didn't love me.
I thought he didn't want me.

1393
01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:34.433
Do you have any idea
what that does to a person?

1394
01:12:34.567 --> 01:12:37.200
Do you have any idea
what it did to me?

1395
01:12:37.333 --> 01:12:38.667
I don't know what to say.

1396
01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:42.667
I have been keeping this secret
for 20 years.

1397
01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:46.266
And I tried to justify it.
I tried to convince myself

1398
01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.867
that what I was doing
was best for you.

1399
01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.967
But I never really believed it.

1400
01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.367
Can you ever forgive me. Abby?

1401
01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:00.333
I forgive you.

1402
01:13:01.233 --> 01:13:02.500
What's done is done.

1403
01:13:02.633 --> 01:13:04.834
and I know you had
your heart set on Paris

1404
01:13:04.967 --> 01:13:07.233
and the wedding
and all of that...

1405
01:13:07.367 --> 01:13:10.834
What I have my heart set on
is my daughter being happy.

1406
01:13:10.967 --> 01:13:14.467
Because you are my everything
and I would never want you

1407
01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:17.200
to marry someone
that you didn't love.

1408
01:13:19.367 --> 01:13:25.667
So. Luke. You still love him.
don't you?

1409
01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.133
I think I'll always love Luke.

1410
01:13:29.266 --> 01:13:30.500
But tonight he made it
pretty clear

1411
01:13:30.633 --> 01:13:33.834
that things between us
are done for good.

1412
01:13:33.967 --> 01:13:36.400
I guess we can't go back
in time.

1413
01:13:36.533 --> 01:13:39.133
but we'll always have
our memories.

1414
01:13:40.633 --> 01:13:42.333
What's next?

1415
01:13:44.567 --> 01:13:48.900
I go to court on Monday.
finalize the divorce

1416
01:13:49.033 --> 01:13:52.633
then I'll go home and finish
getting ready for France.

1417
01:13:52.767 --> 01:13:57.100
Everything's the same.
just no wedding. no Edward.

1418
01:13:59.433 --> 01:14:02.834
I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna go to bed.

1419
01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.200
Good night. sweetheart.

1420
01:14:05.767 --> 01:14:07.000
Good night.

1421
01:14:09.367 --> 01:14:11.333
Ok. Leo. you can
come out now.

1422
01:14:11.467 --> 01:14:12.433
Ahhhh...

1423
01:14:19.433 --> 01:14:21.767
- Good night. kiddo.
- Good night.

1424
01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:29.667
So. you heard.
Abby and Edward...

1425
01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:32.533
I did. Are you ok?

1426
01:14:33.867 --> 01:14:35.600
I'm gonna be.

1427
01:14:37.266 --> 01:14:40.500
You know. Abby will need
some help unpacking

1428
01:14:40.633 --> 01:14:42.834
and getting settled.

1429
01:14:42.967 --> 01:14:47.500
And I've always wanted to see
the Eiffel Tower.

1430
01:14:47.633 --> 01:14:51.100
- Je t'aime.
- Right back at ya.

1431
01:14:54.533 --> 01:14:55.667
You're my girl.

1432
01:15:38.333 --> 01:15:40.767
- I love you. Abby.
- I love you too.

1433
01:15:59.066 --> 01:16:01.967
There you go.

1434
01:16:05.133 --> 01:16:08.433
It's beautiful.
It's my new favorite.

1435
01:16:08.567 --> 01:16:12.367
Yeah. I think it turned out
just right.

1436
01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:14.500
Hey. aren't you supposed
to be in court?

1437
01:16:14.633 --> 01:16:15.867
Oh no. no. That's over.

1438
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.633
I swung by the judge's office
this morning

1439
01:16:17.767 --> 01:16:18.800
and signed the papers.

1440
01:16:18.934 --> 01:16:20.967
We are officially divorced.

1441
01:16:22.300 --> 01:16:23.867
You ok?

1442
01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.834
Yeah. I'm fine. Robin.
Why?

1443
01:16:26.834 --> 01:16:28.633
Come on. she's getting
married anyway.

1444
01:16:28.767 --> 01:16:29.834
It's not a big deal.
I mean. look.

1445
01:16:29.967 --> 01:16:32.700
No point in hanging onto
something that's never gonna be.

1446
01:16:32.834 --> 01:16:33.800
Right?

1447
01:16:35.266 --> 01:16:36.367
What?

1448
01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.500
Emily.

1449
01:16:48.667 --> 01:16:51.533
May I have a moment?
Please.

1450
01:16:54.133 --> 01:16:56.066
Yeah. Yeah.

1451
01:17:02.734 --> 01:17:05.066
ologize.

1452
01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:10.567
It's... it's an apology 20 years
in the making and what I did...

1453
01:17:10.700 --> 01:17:14.900
Convincing you to leave Abby
and to give away your marriage.

1454
01:17:15.033 --> 01:17:16.700
it was simply wrong.

1455
01:17:16.834 --> 01:17:21.333
I had no right to interfere and.
and I hurt two wonderful people

1456
01:17:21.467 --> 01:17:24.200
because I was selfish
and because I believed

1457
01:17:24.333 --> 01:17:26.166
that I alone knew
what was best.

1458
01:17:26.300 --> 01:17:29.266
Well. I... I didn't know.

1459
01:17:31.033 --> 01:17:34.467
Why are you here. Emily?
Huh? Why now?

1460
01:17:34.600 --> 01:17:36.100
I mean come on. it seems like
you got everything

1461
01:17:36.233 --> 01:17:37.200
you ever wanted. right?

1462
01:17:37.333 --> 01:17:38.533
I mean. your daughter's marrying
the better man.

1463
01:17:38.667 --> 01:17:40.266
moving to Paris...

1464
01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:42.567
Sounds like you got
your dream.

1465
01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:45.300
Luke. the thing is my dream
doesn't matter.

1466
01:17:45.433 --> 01:17:47.967
Abby's dream is all that counts.

1467
01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:50.633
And that dream includes you.

1468
01:17:51.333 --> 01:17:53.567
Emily. your daughter's
marrying Edward.

1469
01:17:54.533 --> 01:17:57.734
Obviously you have not heard.
The wedding is off.

1470
01:17:57.867 --> 01:18:03.033
And Abby is at the courthouse.
right now expecting to see you.

1471
01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000
Thank you.

1472
01:18:23.734 --> 01:18:25.700
Breathe. breathe.
You're fine.

1473
01:18:25.834 --> 01:18:28.667
Maybe they're delayed.
Probably not.

1474
01:18:29.333 --> 01:18:33.767
Oh. ok. Here we go.

1475
01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:36.500
I'm gonna take her spot...

1476
01:18:36.633 --> 01:18:38.233
You got it!

1477
01:18:39.934 --> 01:18:42.300
Oh. here we go.

1478
01:18:46.233 --> 01:18:47.200
Perfect.

1479
01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:49.033
Be right back!

1480
01:18:52.967 --> 01:18:54.100
Oh dear.

1481
01:18:54.233 --> 01:18:55.934
Good morning. looks like
everyone's present

1482
01:18:56.066 --> 01:18:57.233
so let's get started.

1483
01:19:01.333 --> 01:19:04.233
- Excuse me. Your Honor.
- Ms. Foster?

1484
01:19:04.367 --> 01:19:08.333
I'm here for the hearing.
marriage of Walker?

1485
01:19:08.467 --> 01:19:09.934
I guess you didn't get
the message.

1486
01:19:10.066 --> 01:19:11.100
That matter is closed.

1487
01:19:11.233 --> 01:19:13.834
Mr. Walker signed the divorce
decree this morning.

1488
01:19:13.967 --> 01:19:19.200
Oh. um. we were supposed to
talk first. have a hearing.

1489
01:19:19.333 --> 01:19:22.233
I want to be heard.
Your Honor.

1490
01:19:22.367 --> 01:19:24.600
Ms. Foster. there's no longer
a need for you to be heard.

1491
01:19:24.734 --> 01:19:26.000
You got what you asked for.

1492
01:19:26.133 --> 01:19:27.900
You signed the document.
he signed the document.

1493
01:19:28.033 --> 01:19:29.433
You're divorced.

1494
01:19:30.033 --> 01:19:31.300
Divorced?

1495
01:19:31.667 --> 01:19:32.900
Mmhm.

1496
01:19:33.667 --> 01:19:35.033
For real?

1497
01:19:36.333 --> 01:19:39.166
Hold on. this is what you said
you wanted and now it's done.

1498
01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:40.834
Now. if you don't mind.
Ms. Foster.

1499
01:19:40.967 --> 01:19:43.700
I have a very busy schedule.

1500
01:19:43.834 --> 01:19:45.934
Sorry. Your Honor.
Sorry I'm late.

1501
01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:47.533
Luke. what's going on?

1502
01:19:47.667 --> 01:19:49.066
I... I changed my mind.
Your Honor.

1503
01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:52.166
I'd like to take my...
my signature back.

1504
01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:53.500
- Hi.
- Hi.

1505
01:19:53.633 --> 01:19:55.333
Luke. there are no take-backs.

1506
01:19:55.467 --> 01:19:56.934
Your divorce is final.

1507
01:19:57.066 --> 01:19:59.033
so if you both will please
vacate the courtroom.

1508
01:19:59.166 --> 01:20:00.734
It's ok. it's not gonna
take more than a minute.

1509
01:20:00.867 --> 01:20:01.800
you guys are ok. right?

1510
01:20:01.934 --> 01:20:03.567
Everything's... Love your suit.
by the way.

1511
01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.266
You do realize this is a court
of law. don't you?

1512
01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.500
You don't make the rules here.
I do.

1513
01:20:06.633 --> 01:20:07.367
I understand. Your Honor.
it is.

1514
01:20:07.500 --> 01:20:09.333
I just. it'll just take us
a minute.

1515
01:20:09.467 --> 01:20:10.467
That's all.

1516
01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:13.166
Fine. You each have 30 seconds
to say your piece.

1517
01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:14.700
Who'd like to go first?

1518
01:20:14.834 --> 01:20:17.667
I will. if the court
doesn't mind.

1519
01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:19.533
No. the court can't wait.

1520
01:20:19.667 --> 01:20:20.633
Go ahead.

1521
01:20:21.367 --> 01:20:22.333
Remind me to retire.

1522
01:20:24.467 --> 01:20:28.367
I know the last time we met
it seemed like my mind

1523
01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.667
was pretty made up

1524
01:20:30.800 --> 01:20:36.700
when I said I wanted to end
my marriage to Mr. Walker.

1525
01:20:36.834 --> 01:20:40.066
But. uh. but things changed.

1526
01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.533
Over the last few days
I realized

1527
01:20:42.667 --> 01:20:48.233
that what I thought was true
about Mr. Walker. about...

1528
01:20:48.367 --> 01:20:53.433
about Luke. isn't in fact true
at all.

1529
01:20:53.567 --> 01:20:56.667
I found out that the real reason
he left me is

1530
01:20:56.800 --> 01:21:00.600
because he loved me.

1531
01:21:00.734 --> 01:21:02.834
So. I would just like to say...

1532
01:21:02.967 --> 01:21:03.967
Time's up.

1533
01:21:05.133 --> 01:21:07.433
You. you have 30 seconds.

1534
01:21:08.066 --> 01:21:10.367
Well I'm not gonna need
that much time. Your Honor.

1535
01:21:14.367 --> 01:21:17.800
Do you love me? For real?

1536
01:21:17.934 --> 01:21:21.633
- I do.
- Good.

1537
01:21:21.767 --> 01:21:23.133
Because I love you too.

1538
01:21:23.767 --> 01:21:25.600
Always have. always will.

1539
01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:01.800
If we make those changes
we should be good to go.

1540
01:22:01.934 --> 01:22:04.367
Thank you very much.
Merci beaucoup.

1541
01:22:04.767 --> 01:22:06.734
Je te vois dans la matinée.
Au revoir.

1542
01:22:19.266 --> 01:22:21.033
- Hello.
- Hey.

1543
01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:25.033
- Champagne?
- Uh-huh.

1544
01:22:25.166 --> 01:22:26.467
What is the occasion?

1545
01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:27.300
Well...

1546
01:22:28.266 --> 01:22:29.533
- Oh!
- I uh...

1547
01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.133
I sold another painting today.

1548
01:22:34.266 --> 01:22:38.133
Sweetie! That's wonderful.
I'm so proud of you.

1549
01:22:38.266 --> 01:22:41.133
Thank you. So. I was thinking
a toast.

1550
01:22:41.266 --> 01:22:42.500
Yes.

1551
01:22:42.633 --> 01:22:47.266
To our past and to our future.

1552
01:22:47.967 --> 01:22:49.367
Absolutely.

1553
01:22:55.667 --> 01:22:57.033
Luke.

1554
01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:02.300
Abby. marry me.

1555
01:23:02.433 --> 01:23:04.233
Again.

1556
01:23:04.367 --> 01:23:06.900
Oui! Oui!

1557
01:23:07.033 --> 01:23:10.600
Yes. yes. yes. absolument yes.
Please. do the honors.

1558
01:23:10.734 --> 01:23:11.900
Of course.

1559
01:23:23.934 --> 01:23:27.467
I'll love you forever.

1560
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:29.500
And forever more.
