00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:41.791
When l was a little girl...

3
00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:45.712
...my mother would remind me each
night to open up my heart to God...

4
00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.549
...for he was kind. merciful and just.

5
00:00:49.883 --> 00:00:53.469
Things changed when my father left
a few years later. leaving her to raise...

6
00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:57.682
...me and my brothers in a little place
on the edge of the Mojave Desert.

7
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.519
She never talked of
a kind and merciful God again.

8
00:01:02.146 --> 00:01:04.647
Instead. she spoke of a prophecy...

9
00:01:04.815 --> 00:01:07.734
...of a time when all the world
would be covered in darkness...

10
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:09.902
...and the fate of mankind
would be decided.

11
00:01:10.904 --> 00:01:14.532
I finally got up the courage to ask
my mother why God had changed...

12
00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.659
...why he was so mad at his children.

13
00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.374
"I don't know." she said.
tucking the covers around me.

14
00:01:23.751 --> 00:01:26.794
"l guess he just got tired
of all the bullshit."

15
00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:32.605
Respond to an MVA
on the on-ramp of 1 0 East.

16
00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:39.028
-You're the idiot!
-Goddamn animals.

17
00:04:39.488 --> 00:04:42.156
Nights like this.
I'd like to take a match to this city...

18
00:04:42.324 --> 00:04:45.451
...just so I could watch
all these motherfuckers burn.

19
00:04:45.953 --> 00:04:48.663
Just a good-old-boy barbecue. huh?

20
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.042
A fresh start.
That's what this place needs.

21
00:05:00.175 --> 00:05:01.175
Jesus.

22
00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:03.803
Shit!

23
00:05:16.233 --> 00:05:18.067
What the fuck?

24
00:05:19.945 --> 00:05:23.614
Stop! Drop the bag.
Put your hands on your head.

25
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:27.827
Man down! I repeat. man down!

26
00:05:28.996 --> 00:05:31.372
It's started.

27
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:32.957
There isn't much time.

28
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.422
Shut the fuck up
and drop the bags now!

29
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:42.675
Hands on your head.

30
00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:45.886
On your head!

31
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.266
Turn around! Turn the fuck around!

32
00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:01.110
Don't! Let him go!

33
00:06:01.278 --> 00:06:02.611
Take the shot. Burton.

34
00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:04.613
Let him the fuck g--

35
00:06:07.743 --> 00:06:09.118
What the--?

36
00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.666
Burton!

37
00:06:18.628 --> 00:06:20.379
What are you doing. Michael?

38
00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:24.216
-These weren't your orders.
-What are you saying?

39
00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:28.137
No. I'm following
my own orders now.

40
00:06:28.513 --> 00:06:31.182
Then you will die
along with the child.

41
00:06:31.475 --> 00:06:34.602
Burton. you fucking know this guy?
What the hell are you--?

42
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.555
You okay. Jeep?

43
00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:56.016
Sorry l woke you. Charlie.

44
00:07:56.184 --> 00:08:00.354
No. It wasn't you.

45
00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.732
He's been
kicking up a storm all night.

46
00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:06.694
He must know something l don't.

47
00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:19.707
Another bad dream?

48
00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:26.630
It's just stress. Jeep. That's all.

49
00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.342
I mean. you do too much worrying.

50
00:08:31.178 --> 00:08:34.263
About this place. about your dad.

51
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.932
About me.

52
00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:43.105
You're the only thing
I like to worry about.

53
00:08:45.192 --> 00:08:47.276
See what l mean?

54
00:08:47.444 --> 00:08:51.530
You're worried about a girl that's eight
months pregnant. Isn't even your baby.

55
00:08:52.199 --> 00:08:54.200
It's enough to give
anybody nightmares.

56
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:59.038
Go ahead and make fun of me.
Everybody else does.

57
00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:01.498
Come on.

58
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.711
You know how much l appreciate
everything you and Bob do for me.

59
00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.094
About a month from now.
this baby's gonna have a new family.

60
00:09:15.639 --> 00:09:19.475
I'm gonna have to start thinking about
what the hell l'm gonna do with my life.

61
00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:22.478
So you're still going through with it?

62
00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:28.192
I'm not ready to be a mama.

63
00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:32.446
Christ. l can barely take care
of myself as it is.

64
00:09:33.907 --> 00:09:36.450
Well. l could help you.

65
00:09:37.827 --> 00:09:41.455
I mean. we could do it together.
you know?

66
00:09:41.748 --> 00:09:43.332
I want to.

67
00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:54.635
You gotta stop carrying the weight
of the world on your shoulders. Jeep.

68
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:22.746
I haven't won my wings yet. That's
why l'm an angel. Second Class.

69
00:10:24.916 --> 00:10:28.460
I don't know whether l like it. being
seen with an angel without any wings.

70
00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:32.214
Oh. l've got to earn them.
And you'll help me. won't you?

71
00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:34.133
Sure. sure.

72
00:10:46.021 --> 00:10:49.982
Lord as my witness. Bob. one of these
days. that thing's gonna hit you back.

73
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:53.819
What are you talking about. Percy?
We got a special relationship here.

74
00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:57.448
Yeah. they got names
for that kind of relationship.

75
00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:08.667
It's disgusting.

76
00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:11.837
You're right. lt is disgusting.

77
00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:15.841
Really. how can she go out
in public looking like that?

78
00:11:16.092 --> 00:11:18.844
I don't know.
Why don't we just ask her?

79
00:11:21.014 --> 00:11:23.766
No. Howard. don't.
You'll embarrass me.

80
00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:28.354
Audrey. your mother was wondering
if you got dressed this morning...

81
00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:32.024
...with the specific intention of showing
your ass off to the entire world.

82
00:11:34.736 --> 00:11:37.237
Yeah. because I woke up
hoping to get double-teamed...

83
00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:41.450
...by a couple of meth-head truckers
in some bathroom of a desert shithole.

84
00:11:42.827 --> 00:11:45.829
It's a good thing we got stuck here.

85
00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:51.794
I feel satisfied with that answer.
I really do.

86
00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:56.006
I'm being punished for something.
I know it.

87
00:12:15.235 --> 00:12:17.194
Shit.

88
00:12:20.698 --> 00:12:23.158
"Next service in 50 miles"?

89
00:12:23.326 --> 00:12:25.994
Fifty miles?

90
00:12:40.218 --> 00:12:41.510
Merry Christmas.

91
00:12:43.304 --> 00:12:45.639
What's so merry about it?

92
00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:51.437
You know. that shit ain't
really good for the baby.

93
00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:54.273
Guess l should think
about quitting. then.

94
00:12:56.985 --> 00:13:00.028
Before you quit.
could l get one from you?

95
00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.698
You can buy a whole pack inside.

96
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:04.950
How about l get one from you...

97
00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:08.162
...and give you two from the pack
you're gonna sell me in there?

98
00:13:17.505 --> 00:13:20.215
You know what? l'm kind of lost.

99
00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:25.596
-Am I right here?
-Not even close.

100
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.891
Son of a bitch.

101
00:13:29.058 --> 00:13:32.561
Well. are there any phones
around here that actually work?

102
00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:36.482
Bob will probably let you use
the diner phone if you ask him nice.

103
00:13:36.649 --> 00:13:38.734
Maybe pay him a little something.

104
00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:41.236
I think I can handle that.

105
00:13:41.404 --> 00:13:44.406
They got anything in there to eat?
Pancakes or....

106
00:13:44.616 --> 00:13:47.242
Yep. Got a buttermilk stack
for $3.75.

107
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:52.581
French toast for $4 if you're into that.
Personally. I like the pancakes. though.

108
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:55.000
-You okay. Charlie?
-Yeah.

109
00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:58.921
I'm fine. This guy's just lost.

110
00:14:04.469 --> 00:14:06.470
Who is that?

111
00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:14.603
-This is what happens when you drive.
-What? What do you want me to do?

112
00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.605
Talk to him.

113
00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.442
It was supposed to be ready
two goddamn hours ago.

114
00:14:22.111 --> 00:14:24.530
It hasn't been two hours.

115
00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:41.630
Hope Salem Lights are all right.
That's all we got.

116
00:14:41.798 --> 00:14:43.632
Charlie. where you been?

117
00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.635
It's not a resort.
We got orders stacking up.

118
00:14:47.095 --> 00:14:49.137
And you best not be smoking again.

119
00:14:49.472 --> 00:14:51.306
A girl in your condition.

120
00:14:51.474 --> 00:14:55.352
Bob. you see where l'm at right now?
Can my condition really get any worse?

121
00:14:56.688 --> 00:14:58.981
Besides. you ain't one to talk.

122
00:14:59.691 --> 00:15:01.400
What? l quit two years ago.

123
00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:06.029
Yeah? So why are you still carrying
that fancy lighter around for. then?

124
00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:09.825
It's a gift from my ex-wife.
I'm sentimental.

125
00:15:09.993 --> 00:15:12.619
I wanna remember
how much I hate her guts.

126
00:15:12.787 --> 00:15:14.663
Hey. man. you got a phone
I can use?

127
00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:18.166
My cell phone ain't got no reception.
The phone booth outside is busted.

128
00:15:18.334 --> 00:15:21.295
Excuse me. Is there any news
about when our car might be fixed?

129
00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:24.131
You said your boy would have us
on the road two hours ago.

130
00:15:24.299 --> 00:15:28.010
At the rate we're going. we'd be lucky
to make it to Scottsdale by Christmas.

131
00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:36.852
Hey.

132
00:15:37.687 --> 00:15:41.106
The hood's up on this Beemer.
Does that mean anything to you?

133
00:15:41.357 --> 00:15:42.357
Yeah.

134
00:15:42.817 --> 00:15:46.111
What are you working on that's so
important you're not doing your job?

135
00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.529
Nothing.

136
00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:54.411
I found it under a bunch of stuff
in the storage shed.

137
00:15:54.579 --> 00:15:57.623
I know how you never like
to throw anything away. so....

138
00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:04.671
-What are you doing?
-What?

139
00:16:05.423 --> 00:16:09.509
Look. Jeep. l like Charlie. l do.

140
00:16:09.802 --> 00:16:12.512
And l think it's real nice.
you giving her a helping hand--

141
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.724
-Leave me alone.
-She's not your responsibility.

142
00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:16.933
Hey.

143
00:16:17.393 --> 00:16:20.812
Don't you walk away from me
when l'm talking to you.

144
00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:24.608
How long you gonna follow her around
like a puppy looking for hind tit?

145
00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:28.111
You're gonna clean up her mess while
she steps out with every other guy?

146
00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:31.198
Don't say that about her!
She's not like that.

147
00:16:38.247 --> 00:16:40.040
Look...

148
00:16:41.084 --> 00:16:43.919
...l know it doesn't
make much sense to you.

149
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:47.756
Sometimes it doesn't
make sense to me. either.

150
00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:54.221
I've been having these dreams
about her.

151
00:16:55.098 --> 00:16:56.765
Some of them so bad...

152
00:16:57.642 --> 00:17:00.394
...l wish l never had to sleep again.

153
00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:05.232
I can't explain it. Dad.

154
00:17:06.818 --> 00:17:09.277
I just feel like it's something
I gotta do.

155
00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:15.367
You know. your mother...

156
00:17:15.535 --> 00:17:18.954
...thought l was crazy
for wanting to buy this place...

157
00:17:19.122 --> 00:17:22.791
...moving us all the way up here.
middle of nowhere.

158
00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:26.128
But l just knew it was something
I had to do.

159
00:17:26.337 --> 00:17:29.631
I couldn't explain it. either.
just like you.

160
00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:33.176
I told your mother.
"Trust me. You just wait and see.

161
00:17:33.344 --> 00:17:36.680
When they build that big old mall
on 9 with all them superstores...

162
00:17:36.848 --> 00:17:40.809
...like they been planning for years.
this place is gonna be a gold mine."

163
00:17:41.477 --> 00:17:44.646
The only problem was. I was wrong.

164
00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.482
They went and built the whole
thing there in Mesa County...

165
00:17:47.650 --> 00:17:50.402
...and l look pretty damn stupid.

166
00:17:52.822 --> 00:17:55.866
And l see you making
the same damn mistake I made...

167
00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:59.828
...believing in something
that's never gonna happen.

168
00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:03.206
Now. you listen to me. son.

169
00:18:03.666 --> 00:18:05.834
It's time for you to leave here.

170
00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:10.172
I don't wanna see you wake up
one day all old and pissed off...

171
00:18:10.339 --> 00:18:13.675
...realizing you're lost.

172
00:18:13.843 --> 00:18:16.511
Just like everybody else
that stops here.

173
00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:26.188
Now. go on. Fix that car. l want
these people out of here by nightfall.

174
00:18:33.946 --> 00:18:36.865
He's about this close
to wrapping it up.

175
00:19:07.396 --> 00:19:09.397
What is wrong with you today?

176
00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:22.786
I told you to get the satellite TV.
but you didn't wanna listen.

177
00:19:22.954 --> 00:19:26.832
-What the hell do l need that crap for?
-The History Channel. man.

178
00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:29.042
I got all the history l can take.

179
00:19:29.252 --> 00:19:32.045
-That's for sure.
-What's your beef now?

180
00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:35.882
You don't need to be
watching this. anyway.

181
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:39.386
All right. baby. Come on. this is
gonna be it right here. Come on.

182
00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:44.099
Clear as day.

183
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:48.770
What the hell's that?

184
00:19:50.648 --> 00:19:54.025
It's one of them test things.

185
00:19:55.194 --> 00:19:57.487
Yeah. that don't look like a test.

186
00:19:58.614 --> 00:20:00.365
Hey. man. l need to use the phone.

187
00:20:02.243 --> 00:20:04.619
In the back. past the kitchen.

188
00:20:04.787 --> 00:20:07.122
Excuse me. but if this
were an actual emergency...

189
00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:11.126
...wouldn't they be giving us
instructions on what to do?

190
00:20:12.336 --> 00:20:17.632
Why don't you check out that old radio.
see if there's any news about the TV?

191
00:20:42.825 --> 00:20:45.827
Eleven a.m. tomorrow at
the courthouse. l know. I'll be there.

192
00:20:45.995 --> 00:20:48.371
Put my little man on the phone.

193
00:20:50.499 --> 00:20:54.836
Because a father's supposed to
be able to talk to his son. That's why.

194
00:20:56.172 --> 00:20:58.798
I don't care what your lawyer said.
I got my own lawyer.

195
00:20:58.966 --> 00:21:01.885
Now. put him on
the goddamn phone.

196
00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:04.971
Hello?

197
00:21:05.348 --> 00:21:09.684
Your phone is breaking up.
Do you hear me? Hello? Hello?

198
00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.312
Shit.

199
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:18.860
Maybe there was an earthquake.

200
00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:22.364
-A lot of people could be hurt.
-Not if it was centered in the desert.

201
00:21:22.531 --> 00:21:24.574
Exactly. Could be nothing
to worry about.

202
00:21:24.742 --> 00:21:28.703
-So then why is the TV out?
-Well. maybe it was terrorists.

203
00:21:29.914 --> 00:21:30.956
Oh. God.

204
00:21:31.123 --> 00:21:33.750
For crying out loud.
there's no use speculating.

205
00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:36.711
I'll just call my brother up.
He'll probably know something.

206
00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:39.130
-l don't think so.
-What do you mean?

207
00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:44.052
I was just on the phone. The shit cut
off in the middle of my conversation.

208
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:45.512
I want my money back.

209
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:47.931
-This is perfect. Absolutely perfect.
-Calm down.

210
00:21:48.099 --> 00:21:51.726
Hey. hey. hey.
Everybody. simmer down.

211
00:21:51.894 --> 00:21:55.063
Nothing to get excited about.
They're probably working on the lines.

212
00:21:55.231 --> 00:21:57.565
Besides. Jeep's gonna
have your car fixed up quick.

213
00:21:57.733 --> 00:22:00.735
-Then you're gonna be on your way.
-Good.

214
00:22:55.249 --> 00:22:58.460
Have a seat wherever you want.
ma'am. Specials are on the board.

215
00:23:05.468 --> 00:23:07.260
I already know what l want.

216
00:23:07.803 --> 00:23:10.889
-Okay. What'll it be?
-l'll have a steak. please.

217
00:23:11.057 --> 00:23:13.308
-How'd you like that cooked?
-Rare. if you would.

218
00:23:13.476 --> 00:23:15.810
-And water and no ice.
-Coming right up.

219
00:23:16.729 --> 00:23:19.272
-"Charlie." is it?
-Yeah.

220
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.816
What an unusual name for a girl.

221
00:23:21.984 --> 00:23:24.277
So they say.
Be right back with your water.

222
00:23:26.072 --> 00:23:29.324
Hello. I'm Gladys. Gladys Foster.

223
00:23:29.658 --> 00:23:32.368
Oh. hello. Gladys.
It's so nice to meet you.

224
00:23:32.536 --> 00:23:35.413
I'm Sandra and this is
my husband. Howard.

225
00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:39.459
What a nice-looking young couple.

226
00:23:39.752 --> 00:23:43.671
-What brings you up to these parts?
-We are on our way to Scottsdale.

227
00:23:43.839 --> 00:23:48.218
But our car broke down. and we're
stuck here while it's getting fixed.

228
00:23:48.385 --> 00:23:49.719
What a nuisance.

229
00:23:49.887 --> 00:23:52.680
Say. Gladys. you know. the lines
seem to be down around here.

230
00:23:52.848 --> 00:23:55.683
The phone and the TV.
And l was just wondering if you...

231
00:23:55.851 --> 00:23:59.938
...might have heard something on
your way up about what's going on.

232
00:24:00.106 --> 00:24:04.859
Oh. you don't have to worry about that.
sweetheart. It'll all be over soon.

233
00:24:07.238 --> 00:24:08.655
Oh. okay.

234
00:24:12.034 --> 00:24:13.868
Excuse me.

235
00:24:15.162 --> 00:24:17.831
Hey. So. what are we looking at?

236
00:24:17.998 --> 00:24:21.042
I don't know. There's probably
something wrong with the computer...

237
00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:25.380
-...but we don't have the gear to test it.
-Oh. shit.

238
00:24:26.048 --> 00:24:27.966
They're gonna be pissed.

239
00:24:28.134 --> 00:24:31.886
Tell them we'll call and have it towed
to one of those dealerships in Harding.

240
00:24:32.054 --> 00:24:35.265
Well. that's not gonna happen.
The phone's out.

241
00:24:35.432 --> 00:24:37.559
-What?
-Yeah.

242
00:24:37.852 --> 00:24:40.520
Oh. thank you. dear.

243
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.897
How far along are you?

244
00:24:43.607 --> 00:24:45.316
Oh. just about there.

245
00:24:45.484 --> 00:24:49.154
-The father must be very proud.
-l wouldn't know.

246
00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:51.489
-He's....
-Out of sight. out of mind.

247
00:24:51.657 --> 00:24:52.866
I see.

248
00:24:54.410 --> 00:24:56.494
So l take it you're not married?

249
00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:58.913
-No.
-That's too bad.

250
00:24:59.081 --> 00:25:03.209
No. I prefer it that way. I don't
need a man telling me what to do.

251
00:25:03.544 --> 00:25:06.713
-But what about the baby?
-l got it under control.

252
00:25:06.881 --> 00:25:08.381
But it's gonna burn.

253
00:25:11.093 --> 00:25:12.385
What'd you just say?

254
00:25:12.553 --> 00:25:15.346
I said. your fucking baby's
gonna burn.

255
00:25:20.436 --> 00:25:21.603
Go to hell. lady.

256
00:25:24.773 --> 00:25:27.066
-Fucking Jesus freak.
-What happened?

257
00:25:34.283 --> 00:25:36.659
All those little babies
are gonna burn.

258
00:25:39.955 --> 00:25:42.707
-Gladys.
-Shut up. you stupid fucking cunt.

259
00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:45.460
All you do is
complain. complain. complain.

260
00:25:45.628 --> 00:25:47.128
What?

261
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:48.963
-What? What?
-No. Howard.

262
00:25:49.131 --> 00:25:50.965
-What did you just say?
-No. no. don't.

263
00:25:51.133 --> 00:25:55.261
I don't know who you think you are.
but I'd like you to apologize to my wife.

264
00:25:57.139 --> 00:25:59.557
-Howard!
-Oh. my--

265
00:26:01.602 --> 00:26:02.644
Shit.

266
00:26:03.229 --> 00:26:05.104
You're all gonna fucking die.

267
00:26:16.659 --> 00:26:18.117
No.

268
00:26:23.457 --> 00:26:24.624
What the fuck. man?

269
00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:40.848
Shoot her. Jeep!

270
00:26:42.309 --> 00:26:44.143
You will never save her.

271
00:26:45.562 --> 00:26:46.688
Shoot the bitch!

272
00:26:48.691 --> 00:26:50.191
Shoot her!

273
00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:10.712
No. no!

274
00:27:10.879 --> 00:27:14.674
Somebody help me! Somebody--

275
00:27:16.510 --> 00:27:18.970
Put pressure on it!
Don't look at me like that...

276
00:27:19.138 --> 00:27:21.556
...or your husband
will bleed to death.

277
00:27:23.892 --> 00:27:27.061
Keep pressure right there. Calm down.
Keep pressure on his neck.

278
00:27:27.396 --> 00:27:29.230
Who the fuck is this old lady?

279
00:27:31.066 --> 00:27:34.944
-lt's okay. lt's okay.
-Charlie.

280
00:27:35.112 --> 00:27:37.238
Charlie. call 91 1 !

281
00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:40.158
Keep your eyes on the old lady. man.

282
00:27:41.410 --> 00:27:43.786
-Help him.
-All right. calm down.

283
00:27:43.954 --> 00:27:45.913
-Help him.
-Audrey.

284
00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:53.421
Careful with him.

285
00:27:58.177 --> 00:28:01.095
-Easy.
-He'll be okay?

286
00:28:16.195 --> 00:28:18.237
Howard! Breathe. Just breathe.

287
00:28:18.822 --> 00:28:21.491
-How far is it to the hospital?
-Mom. how did she do that?

288
00:28:21.658 --> 00:28:24.285
-l don't know!
-Seventy. maybe 80 miles.

289
00:28:24.453 --> 00:28:26.037
-What?
-Eighty mil--?

290
00:28:26.205 --> 00:28:28.790
I'm gonna get there as soon
as we can. but I can't stay.

291
00:28:28.957 --> 00:28:30.792
-That's fine! Please drive faster!
-Okay.

292
00:28:33.295 --> 00:28:36.464
Oh. God. please go faster.

293
00:28:37.841 --> 00:28:39.967
What the hell is that?

294
00:28:43.597 --> 00:28:45.640
They're clouds!
What do you think they are?

295
00:28:45.808 --> 00:28:47.558
They're not clouds. Clouds don't buzz!

296
00:28:52.356 --> 00:28:54.148
Oh. my God.

297
00:29:08.163 --> 00:29:12.542
I can't believe she was still standing
after Percy hit her with that frying pan.

298
00:29:13.043 --> 00:29:17.213
He broke her fucking neck.
I saw it. l swear I saw it.

299
00:29:18.715 --> 00:29:22.510
Did you see the gun that guy had?
What's a guy do with a gun like that?

300
00:29:27.099 --> 00:29:30.268
Hey. Jeep. It's all right. son.

301
00:29:31.728 --> 00:29:33.938
I couldn't pull the trigger.

302
00:29:34.106 --> 00:29:36.107
I froze.

303
00:29:38.193 --> 00:29:40.778
I saw what I needed to do.

304
00:29:41.655 --> 00:29:43.948
I was too afraid.

305
00:29:46.410 --> 00:29:49.537
She would have killed you.
She would have killed Charlie.

306
00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.497
Hey.

307
00:29:51.665 --> 00:29:55.543
You ain't got nothing to be
ashamed of. You hear me. son?

308
00:29:56.378 --> 00:29:59.213
Not everybody can play the hero.

309
00:29:59.882 --> 00:30:02.592
Especially when it comes
to pulling the trigger.

310
00:30:11.351 --> 00:30:14.103
What happened? What happened?

311
00:30:14.605 --> 00:30:16.564
-What's going on?
-l gotta get my Bible.

312
00:30:16.732 --> 00:30:19.775
-What for?
-Somebody's gotta start praying.

313
00:30:35.417 --> 00:30:37.960
Jesus. she's burning up.

314
00:30:38.212 --> 00:30:40.963
How is that possible?
She's been dead for an hour.

315
00:30:41.131 --> 00:30:44.926
I don't give a fuck how long she's been
dead. Bitch just walked on the ceiling.

316
00:30:45.093 --> 00:30:47.053
She ain't staying in here.

317
00:30:47.471 --> 00:30:49.555
The old bitch is heavy.
Hold her up. Jeep!

318
00:30:49.723 --> 00:30:51.599
-l'm trying.
-Where are the flies?

319
00:30:51.767 --> 00:30:53.434
How am l supposed to know?

320
00:30:53.602 --> 00:30:57.563
Are you asking me to explain the
behavior of a motherfucking pestilence?

321
00:30:59.107 --> 00:31:02.818
Hey. Somebody's coming.

322
00:31:03.946 --> 00:31:05.071
Now what?

323
00:31:08.033 --> 00:31:12.537
-All right. Now we're talking.
-Wait a second. L.A.P.D.?

324
00:31:15.165 --> 00:31:18.626
-l'm from Vegas. man.
-Give me the gun.

325
00:31:29.304 --> 00:31:31.305
Oh. thank God.

326
00:31:38.105 --> 00:31:39.647
Charlie. wait!

327
00:31:50.951 --> 00:31:53.661
Take one more step
and l'll drop you right there.

328
00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:55.705
Is that how you greet
all your customers?

329
00:31:55.872 --> 00:31:57.707
Mister. after what
we've been through...

330
00:31:57.874 --> 00:32:00.835
...you're lucky we don't shoot you first
and greet you later.

331
00:32:01.003 --> 00:32:02.628
Now. let me see them teeth.

332
00:32:04.673 --> 00:32:07.174
Your teeth. goddamn it!
Let me see them!

333
00:32:11.805 --> 00:32:13.806
No shark teeth. Pop.

334
00:32:14.933 --> 00:32:16.559
Okay. then.

335
00:32:17.144 --> 00:32:20.187
-How about you tell us your name?
-Michael.

336
00:32:22.899 --> 00:32:25.276
I'm sorry about that. Michael.

337
00:32:25.444 --> 00:32:28.863
We had this old lady in here
who went crazy in my place.

338
00:32:29.031 --> 00:32:32.033
She had these teeth.
Never seen anything like it.

339
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.201
Practically bit a man in half.

340
00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.412
What are you doing
out here. anyway?

341
00:32:37.456 --> 00:32:40.374
You don't look like
any policeman l ever saw.

342
00:32:40.542 --> 00:32:42.084
Even one from L.A.

343
00:32:43.462 --> 00:32:45.338
But he's gotta be. right?

344
00:32:45.505 --> 00:32:49.884
I mean. who the hell would be
crazy enough to steal a cop car?

345
00:32:53.388 --> 00:32:54.805
You don't know. do you?

346
00:32:55.515 --> 00:32:57.141
Don't know what?

347
00:32:57.351 --> 00:33:00.728
We don't know anything. Nothing
works. The TV. the radio. the phone.

348
00:33:01.146 --> 00:33:04.106
-l'm running out of time.
-Now. you just hold on there. fella.

349
00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:08.277
You better start talking.
or you just get the hell out of here.

350
00:33:09.863 --> 00:33:11.572
Hold on.

351
00:33:14.576 --> 00:33:16.661
Dad. just tell him you're sorry.

352
00:33:19.414 --> 00:33:20.873
Hey. hey. hey. son.

353
00:33:21.124 --> 00:33:25.544
Son. now. l'm sure you don't wanna go
spilling blood for no good reason...

354
00:33:25.712 --> 00:33:27.755
...in front of
all these decent people now.

355
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:30.966
Now. what do you say
about just letting Bob go?

356
00:33:31.134 --> 00:33:34.095
Then you can be on your way.
nice and easy.

357
00:33:50.445 --> 00:33:51.529
They're here.

358
00:33:54.616 --> 00:33:57.159
You're gonna need this.

359
00:33:57.703 --> 00:34:00.204
-Wait. who's here?
-More like her.

360
00:34:00.372 --> 00:34:01.914
What do you mean. like her?

361
00:34:10.674 --> 00:34:13.300
Hold on.
I don't think that's such a good idea.

362
00:34:13.635 --> 00:34:14.969
Dad. I can handle it.

363
00:34:15.804 --> 00:34:19.890
He can handle it.
He doesn't have a choice.

364
00:34:25.981 --> 00:34:28.065
Don't do anything brave.

365
00:34:33.363 --> 00:34:36.323
-What's happening?
-You better get back inside.

366
00:34:45.167 --> 00:34:47.001
Come on. Jeep.

367
00:34:47.377 --> 00:34:49.420
Jeep. come on!

368
00:35:20.535 --> 00:35:22.369
Everybody stay calm.

369
00:35:27.584 --> 00:35:31.003
Okay. we're locked in here.
so what the fuck we doing now?

370
00:35:51.024 --> 00:35:54.735
All right. Rambo. you got us up here.
You mind telling us what we're fighting?

371
00:35:54.903 --> 00:35:58.072
Listen. Listen.

372
00:35:58.365 --> 00:35:59.615
You hear what l'm hearing?

373
00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:08.582
-What the hell is that?
-lt sounds almost like....

374
00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:10.376
Ice cream?

375
00:36:17.926 --> 00:36:19.677
It can't be fucking serious. right?

376
00:36:19.845 --> 00:36:22.763
There's a safety switch on the side.
You won't be needing it.

377
00:36:22.931 --> 00:36:24.765
Push it all the way down two clicks.

378
00:36:25.267 --> 00:36:27.226
Now. when this starts.
you hold on tight.

379
00:36:27.394 --> 00:36:30.229
Otherwise. you're gonna
blow your hand off.

380
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.860
What the fuck are
y'all looking at me for?

381
00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:03.220
-Audrey.
-Yeah.

382
00:37:03.388 --> 00:37:05.431
Honey. listen.

383
00:37:06.516 --> 00:37:09.143
It's the ice-cream man.

384
00:37:46.014 --> 00:37:48.140
Oh. man. he don't look that bad.

385
00:37:49.476 --> 00:37:51.477
Oh. shit. Oh. shit. Oh. shit.

386
00:37:53.355 --> 00:37:54.688
Oh. shit!

387
00:37:54.856 --> 00:37:56.607
Get ready.

388
00:38:18.546 --> 00:38:19.713
Is that it?

389
00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:46.448
Now! Shoot now!

390
00:40:15.955 --> 00:40:19.333
-They're just regular people!
-Not anymore. Keep firing.

391
00:40:39.646 --> 00:40:41.563
Don't let them get near the windows!

392
00:40:57.705 --> 00:40:59.081
Where is he?

393
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.042
Mom. open your eyes!

394
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:03.961
-l can't!
-You have to open your eyes!

395
00:41:04.129 --> 00:41:06.088
-l can't!
-Yes!

396
00:41:18.351 --> 00:41:21.103
-See what you made me do. Mother?
-No!

397
00:41:22.313 --> 00:41:23.689
No!

398
00:41:24.732 --> 00:41:25.941
Hold on to him.

399
00:41:26.109 --> 00:41:28.152
-Dad!
-Hold him. Hold him. Grab him.

400
00:41:29.696 --> 00:41:31.321
Charlie!

401
00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.407
There you are.

402
00:41:42.584 --> 00:41:43.917
Dad! Oh. my God!

403
00:41:56.639 --> 00:41:59.808
We got them running.
We got them running!

404
00:41:59.976 --> 00:42:02.352
-No.
-No. he's out there. He's alive.

405
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.439
-He's out there. He's out there.
-He's gone.

406
00:42:05.607 --> 00:42:07.441
He's gone.

407
00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:15.657
Are you okay?

408
00:42:16.326 --> 00:42:17.618
Yeah. Yeah. l'm fine.

409
00:42:21.206 --> 00:42:22.372
Thanks.

410
00:42:23.458 --> 00:42:25.667
I told you not to do anything brave.

411
00:42:30.423 --> 00:42:32.507
We got them running.

412
00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:38.138
-What happened?
-Someone needs to be on the roof.

413
00:42:38.306 --> 00:42:40.724
-l'll go.
-Hold on.

414
00:42:42.644 --> 00:42:44.436
You better start talking.

415
00:42:50.693 --> 00:42:54.238
The last time God lost faith in man...

416
00:42:55.114 --> 00:42:57.366
...he sent a flood.

417
00:42:58.826 --> 00:43:01.536
This time. he sent
what you see outside.

418
00:43:01.704 --> 00:43:03.997
Are you saying this is
the Apocalypse?

419
00:43:04.332 --> 00:43:06.959
I'm saying this is an extermination.

420
00:43:08.044 --> 00:43:11.171
Those things outside
are just vessels.

421
00:43:11.339 --> 00:43:12.464
They're possessed.

422
00:43:12.757 --> 00:43:14.883
The weakest willed
are the easiest to turn.

423
00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:18.679
Possessed by what? Demons?

424
00:43:18.846 --> 00:43:23.350
No.

425
00:43:24.686 --> 00:43:25.852
By angels.

426
00:43:26.604 --> 00:43:29.856
No. no. wait. wait. wait.
Hold on. son.

427
00:43:30.024 --> 00:43:32.317
I don't know what book
you've been reading...

428
00:43:32.485 --> 00:43:37.823
...but in my version.
the angels are the good guys.

429
00:43:38.157 --> 00:43:40.742
Well. the truth. l'm afraid.
is never that simple.

430
00:43:41.035 --> 00:43:45.580
Bullshit. l'm not a pastor. but I've
never heard of no ice-cream man...

431
00:43:45.748 --> 00:43:49.334
...or old lady eating raw meat. jumping
on the ceiling with baby teeth...

432
00:43:49.502 --> 00:43:51.545
...so l don't know what
you talking about.

433
00:43:51.713 --> 00:43:54.006
Hold on. How do you know
so much about them?

434
00:43:55.383 --> 00:43:57.884
Because until last night.
I was on their side.

435
00:43:58.594 --> 00:44:00.429
-So you're saying--
-Yeah. that's right.

436
00:44:00.596 --> 00:44:05.475
Yesterday I was fucking Santa Claus.
I mean. you know this is crazy. right?

437
00:44:05.643 --> 00:44:07.936
I mean. l don't even believe in God.

438
00:44:08.104 --> 00:44:11.023
Well. that's just fine. Bob.
He doesn't believe in you. either.

439
00:44:12.191 --> 00:44:14.526
He doesn't believe
in any of this anymore.

440
00:44:14.694 --> 00:44:18.780
I knew this day was coming. l just
didn't think I'd be around to see it.

441
00:44:18.948 --> 00:44:21.533
Come on. Percy. What are
we even talking about this for?

442
00:44:21.701 --> 00:44:27.247
Angels and possessed people?
It's not real! lt's--

443
00:44:27.665 --> 00:44:29.666
Have you looked outside. Bob?

444
00:44:29.834 --> 00:44:34.629
I mean. those people aren't
exactly our regular customers.

445
00:44:36.591 --> 00:44:38.675
Wait. so are you here to protect us?

446
00:44:40.178 --> 00:44:42.262
No. not you.

447
00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:44.639
Her.

448
00:44:45.641 --> 00:44:48.852
Me? Why me?

449
00:44:49.020 --> 00:44:52.689
Because your child is the only hope
humanity has of surviving.

450
00:45:02.116 --> 00:45:03.450
Wait. wait. Wait a minute.

451
00:45:03.618 --> 00:45:08.205
This can't be happening to me.
I mean. l'm nobody. l'm just a waitress.

452
00:45:08.831 --> 00:45:12.459
-l don't even own a car.
-None of that matters anymore.

453
00:45:12.835 --> 00:45:15.420
Either your child lives
or mankind dies.

454
00:45:17.632 --> 00:45:20.634
So we supposed to hold those
things off till the baby gets here?

455
00:45:20.802 --> 00:45:23.887
-That's it.
-l'm only eight months pregnant.

456
00:45:24.514 --> 00:45:26.139
This shit can't be happening. man.

457
00:45:26.307 --> 00:45:29.309
How are we supposed to
survive here for a month?

458
00:45:29.685 --> 00:45:30.977
We won't have to.

459
00:45:34.190 --> 00:45:37.150
-lt's coming soon. isn't it?
-Yes.

460
00:45:39.737 --> 00:45:43.949
Listen. l simply don't care
what you people believe.

461
00:45:44.117 --> 00:45:46.493
And those things outside.
they don't care. either.

462
00:45:46.661 --> 00:45:49.413
They just want the child dead.

463
00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:53.041
Now. this first attack
was a test of our strength.

464
00:45:53.209 --> 00:45:55.752
The next will be a test
of our weakness.

465
00:45:57.338 --> 00:46:01.675
Now. we can sit here and discuss it.
or you can try and help me.

466
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:07.139
But believe me.
something much worse is on the way.

467
00:46:19.068 --> 00:46:21.319
Sons of bitches.

468
00:46:22.822 --> 00:46:25.615
They're out there. l can feel them.

469
00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.040
So. what's with that gun?

470
00:46:35.543 --> 00:46:36.710
What?

471
00:46:36.878 --> 00:46:41.256
Your piece.
the one you killed Grandma with.

472
00:46:41.424 --> 00:46:43.383
I don't reckon it's for hunting buck.

473
00:46:46.262 --> 00:46:48.096
I use it for protection.

474
00:46:48.848 --> 00:46:50.682
Protection from what?

475
00:46:51.517 --> 00:46:54.394
-From people.
-People?

476
00:46:55.396 --> 00:46:57.898
Yeah. You know.
people that be starting shit.

477
00:46:58.065 --> 00:47:00.734
-Regular people or just. like--
-No.

478
00:47:00.902 --> 00:47:04.070
Not "regular" regular people.
but. you know--

479
00:47:04.238 --> 00:47:06.072
Oh. yeah. Irregular people. then.

480
00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:08.909
Fuck out of here. man.

481
00:47:10.077 --> 00:47:12.996
I got my reasons for doing
what I do and that's that.

482
00:47:25.009 --> 00:47:28.136
I've never actually used it. all right?

483
00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:33.225
I may have flashed it or whatever
and scared a few folks...

484
00:47:34.268 --> 00:47:37.145
...but never actually fired off.

485
00:47:40.608 --> 00:47:42.901
Not until today.

486
00:47:47.490 --> 00:47:50.283
This shit is crazy. man.

487
00:47:55.873 --> 00:47:57.457
When I was a kid...

488
00:47:58.334 --> 00:48:04.214
...my father would sit by my bed
every night before l went to sleep.

489
00:48:07.301 --> 00:48:10.220
And he'd say to me:

490
00:48:13.641 --> 00:48:15.725
"Percy...

491
00:48:17.645 --> 00:48:20.814
...if you don't wake up tomorrow...

492
00:48:22.650 --> 00:48:25.485
...if it turns out that...

493
00:48:25.653 --> 00:48:26.820
...today...

494
00:48:28.990 --> 00:48:31.992
...is your last day on Earth...

495
00:48:33.995 --> 00:48:36.705
...would you be proud...

496
00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:40.667
...of what you've done in this life?

497
00:48:43.170 --> 00:48:45.046
Because...

498
00:48:45.881 --> 00:48:48.174
...if you ain't...

499
00:48:50.636 --> 00:48:53.221
...you better start getting square."

500
00:49:11.741 --> 00:49:13.783
Fuck it.

501
00:49:30.885 --> 00:49:32.052
On the house.

502
00:49:33.012 --> 00:49:35.096
Thank you.

503
00:49:38.476 --> 00:49:40.352
You hungry?

504
00:49:40.936 --> 00:49:41.978
No.

505
00:49:42.772 --> 00:49:46.941
Hell. just because it's the end of the
world. doesn't mean you gotta starve.

506
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:49.444
I'm just happy
they still have the gas on.

507
00:50:01.874 --> 00:50:04.918
I never really cared much for beer.

508
00:50:07.004 --> 00:50:10.340
Howard was the beer drinker
in the family.

509
00:50:23.771 --> 00:50:25.313
So. what did you do?

510
00:50:26.107 --> 00:50:29.484
You know. before you came here?

511
00:50:30.528 --> 00:50:32.821
I was a soldier.

512
00:50:33.906 --> 00:50:36.616
I was a general in his army.

513
00:50:40.121 --> 00:50:43.832
Well. what changed?
What made you leave?

514
00:50:44.208 --> 00:50:47.502
I was given an order
I didn't believe in.

515
00:50:49.630 --> 00:50:51.923
He lost faith.

516
00:50:52.091 --> 00:50:53.925
I didn't.

517
00:51:00.683 --> 00:51:02.559
Well. how come you still have faith?

518
00:51:03.477 --> 00:51:07.731
I mean. it seems like
everything I have faith in...

519
00:51:08.441 --> 00:51:10.191
...causes me nothing but trouble.

520
00:51:16.657 --> 00:51:20.952
When God chose your kind...

521
00:51:21.704 --> 00:51:24.664
...as the object of his love...

522
00:51:26.417 --> 00:51:30.837
...l was the first in all heaven
to bow down before you.

523
00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:35.008
My love...

524
00:51:35.342 --> 00:51:39.679
...my hope for mankind.
was no less than his.

525
00:51:43.809 --> 00:51:47.687
But l have watched you
trample that gift.

526
00:51:48.397 --> 00:51:52.525
I've watched you kill each other
over race and greed...

527
00:51:52.693 --> 00:51:56.821
...waging war over dust and rubble
and the words in old books.

528
00:51:57.615 --> 00:52:01.326
And yet. in the midst
of all this darkness...

529
00:52:02.787 --> 00:52:06.080
...l see some people
who will not be bowed.

530
00:52:08.459 --> 00:52:13.379
I see some people
who will not give up...

531
00:52:14.298 --> 00:52:17.550
...even when they know
all hope is lost.

532
00:52:18.886 --> 00:52:20.804
Some people...

533
00:52:22.556 --> 00:52:27.143
...who realize that being lost
is so close to being found.

534
00:52:28.771 --> 00:52:30.730
I see you. Jeep.

535
00:52:32.358 --> 00:52:36.903
Fifteen years old. your mother leaves.
Your father withdraws from the world.

536
00:52:37.238 --> 00:52:40.240
You spend the next five years
of your young life...

537
00:52:40.407 --> 00:52:42.492
...helping him find his way home.

538
00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:47.372
You love a woman
who bears the child of another...

539
00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:50.542
...and you love her
with no thought of yourself...

540
00:52:51.669 --> 00:52:55.713
...even though you know she may
never love you the way you love her.

541
00:52:57.049 --> 00:53:00.343
You. Jeep.

542
00:53:02.263 --> 00:53:05.098
You are the reason l still have faith.

543
00:53:11.564 --> 00:53:14.440
It's almost time for the next shift.

544
00:54:06.285 --> 00:54:08.620
You question him?

545
00:54:09.997 --> 00:54:12.624
I question myself.

546
00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:15.168
And so should you.

547
00:54:18.464 --> 00:54:22.467
Since their creation.
he has told us only to love them.

548
00:54:24.345 --> 00:54:26.304
I cannot stop.

549
00:54:27.932 --> 00:54:30.141
They have brought this judgment
upon themselves.

550
00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:32.685
They are just lost.

551
00:54:33.354 --> 00:54:35.355
It is our place to guide them.

552
00:54:35.522 --> 00:54:38.608
It is our place to obey.

553
00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:41.527
Tell me. Gabriel.
do you wish to be a son...

554
00:54:41.695 --> 00:54:45.365
...who gives his father
what he asks for or what he needs?

555
00:54:45.532 --> 00:54:48.743
This is not your test. Michael.

556
00:54:49.370 --> 00:54:51.162
How dare you presume
to know his heart?

557
00:54:51.330 --> 00:54:53.581
Because he made this one.

558
00:54:54.124 --> 00:54:57.210
And it tells me he shouldn't
lose faith now.

559
00:54:59.505 --> 00:55:01.798
It's too late.

560
00:55:02.675 --> 00:55:04.759
The order has been given.

561
00:55:04.927 --> 00:55:09.180
The weak will turn against the strong
and you will undo what has been done.

562
00:55:09.598 --> 00:55:11.891
And if you defy him...

563
00:55:13.185 --> 00:55:15.895
...you'll anger him for the last time.

564
00:55:17.106 --> 00:55:19.232
Only if l fail.

565
00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:23.236
War is coming to man. Michael.
whether you wish it or not.

566
00:55:23.404 --> 00:55:26.948
The dogs of heaven
will be unleashed.

567
00:55:58.355 --> 00:56:06.112
Sandra.

568
00:56:34.975 --> 00:56:36.976
Howard?

569
00:57:01.335 --> 00:57:03.377
Howard.

570
00:57:12.429 --> 00:57:14.472
Baby. help me.

571
00:57:20.312 --> 00:57:21.354
Howard!

572
00:57:21.522 --> 00:57:23.940
Help me!

573
00:57:24.108 --> 00:57:27.026
Please. someone help me!

574
00:57:27.361 --> 00:57:29.946
-Hey. Hey. what are you doing?
-Let me go.

575
00:57:30.114 --> 00:57:32.115
-No.
-He's alive! Let me go!

576
00:57:39.414 --> 00:57:41.374
Mom. Mom. what are you doing?

577
00:57:41.542 --> 00:57:42.625
-Mom. stop!
-He's alive.

578
00:57:42.793 --> 00:57:44.252
-He's not.
-Your father is alive.

579
00:57:44.419 --> 00:57:45.419
Let go of me!

580
00:57:47.339 --> 00:57:49.382
No. don't!

581
00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:51.634
Come back! Come back!

582
00:57:51.802 --> 00:57:53.344
Come back!

583
00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:11.487
Howard!

584
00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:13.990
-Howard!
-Mom. Mom. get down!

585
00:58:15.576 --> 00:58:16.617
Percy?

586
00:58:36.305 --> 00:58:38.472
It's my fault.

587
00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.850
I fell asleep.

588
00:58:41.435 --> 00:58:43.769
-Dad.
-Don't.

589
00:58:47.441 --> 00:58:49.442
I did this.

590
00:58:50.027 --> 00:58:52.111
He trusted me...

591
00:58:52.279 --> 00:58:55.448
...and just like your mother.
I let him down.

592
00:58:55.616 --> 00:58:57.992
I let everybody down.

593
00:59:13.300 --> 00:59:17.220
Here. Mom. if you take one of these.
you're gonna feel better. okay?

594
00:59:37.199 --> 00:59:38.658
This is your fault.

595
00:59:40.369 --> 00:59:42.912
We were only moving
because of you.

596
00:59:43.413 --> 00:59:45.831
We sacrificed everything...

597
00:59:45.999 --> 00:59:47.208
...for you.

598
00:59:47.834 --> 00:59:51.379
No. You-- You wanted to go.

599
00:59:51.546 --> 00:59:55.174
-You said that you wanted to.
-l loved my house.

600
00:59:56.176 --> 00:59:58.803
I loved my life.
and you have ruined it.

601
01:00:00.180 --> 01:00:02.014
You ruined everything!

602
01:00:03.308 --> 01:00:05.101
-Everything.
-Enough.

603
01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:09.522
You're just gonna sit here
and torture your daughter like this?

604
01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:13.609
Can you come help me find
a station that actually works?

605
01:00:34.756 --> 01:00:36.215
No Homeland Security.

606
01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:38.092
-No military response.
-Wait.

607
01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:40.261
You guys. Oh. my God.
I'm hearing something.

608
01:00:40.429 --> 01:00:43.264
We're on our own here. people.
If you can hear my voice...

609
01:00:43.432 --> 01:00:47.560
...we're getting the first bits of
good news since this Apocalypse...

610
01:00:47.728 --> 01:00:51.647
...began nearly 48 hours ago.

611
01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:54.400
A militia has formed
on the outskirts of Las Vegas...

612
01:00:54.568 --> 01:00:57.111
...and begun to engage
those affected.

613
01:00:57.279 --> 01:01:00.781
I'm getting unconfirmed reports
of other militias gathering...

614
01:01:00.949 --> 01:01:05.202
...in Death Valley. Zion and Red Ridge
National Parks in the Mojave Desert.

615
01:01:05.370 --> 01:01:07.330
Red Ridge. That's only
an hour up the road.

616
01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:09.915
-Does that mean we can leave?
-No.

617
01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:13.252
-We're not going anywhere.
-What?

618
01:01:13.420 --> 01:01:16.213
I don't know about you.
but I gotta get the fuck out of here.

619
01:01:16.381 --> 01:01:18.049
No.

620
01:01:19.134 --> 01:01:21.552
I won't risk being on the move
when the baby comes.

621
01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:26.140
It's too dangerous.

622
01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:34.690
Too dangerous? What the fuck
you mean. too dangerous?

623
01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:37.985
May God give us
the strength to survive...

624
01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:40.780
...and have mercy for those
who are already lost.

625
01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:11.644
-Hey.
-Hey.

626
01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.317
You okay?

627
01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:25.991
You know. the crazy thing is.
I didn't even want this baby.

628
01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:31.330
I even went down to the clinic.
do you know that?

629
01:02:32.707 --> 01:02:34.834
I remember sitting
in the waiting room...

630
01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:38.754
...absolutely sure
I was doing the right thing.

631
01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:43.008
Then l started getting this feeling.

632
01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:45.678
Like l was...

633
01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:51.684
...falling into the deepest. darkest hole
imaginable. I couldn't--

634
01:02:52.978 --> 01:02:56.188
I couldn't breathe. l couldn't speak.

635
01:02:59.651 --> 01:03:01.652
I kept thinking:

636
01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:05.489
"This must be what death feels like."

637
01:03:10.704 --> 01:03:13.372
And when they called my name.
I just ran.

638
01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:20.212
For a long time...

639
01:03:22.132 --> 01:03:25.468
...l pretended l could go back
whenever l wanted.

640
01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:29.305
End it like l planned.

641
01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:36.479
But then l'd start getting
that damn feeling again...

642
01:03:39.191 --> 01:03:41.734
...and l knew I didn't have a choice.

643
01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:46.322
Somehow l knew this
had already been decided.

644
01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:49.867
And it made me just....

645
01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:54.538
It made me hate...

646
01:03:54.915 --> 01:03:56.665
...this thing growing inside of me.

647
01:03:59.711 --> 01:04:02.630
You shouldn't say things
like that. Charlie.

648
01:04:03.632 --> 01:04:05.090
It ain't right.

649
01:04:05.509 --> 01:04:09.470
You'll get through this.
I know you will.

650
01:04:11.765 --> 01:04:14.058
Why do you have so much faith
in me. Jeep. huh?

651
01:04:17.270 --> 01:04:20.648
God knows I've never given you
or anybody else a reason to.

652
01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:27.446
Or is it that you don't have any other
hard-luck cases to follow around?

653
01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:34.537
You know. you're not the only one
who's had it hard around here. okay?

654
01:04:35.455 --> 01:04:39.124
So you let me know when you
stop feeling sorry for yourself.

655
01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:50.636
-All you have to do is this.
-No. no. I know.

656
01:04:50.804 --> 01:04:53.264
It's two clicks all the way down.

657
01:04:54.224 --> 01:04:58.060
I dated a Marine last summer.
He was kind of a gun freak.

658
01:04:58.812 --> 01:05:00.604
My parents hated him.

659
01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:03.399
I'll bet they did.

660
01:05:06.570 --> 01:05:10.823
You know. my mom was right.
It is my fault that we're here.

661
01:05:11.992 --> 01:05:13.534
She didn't mean that.

662
01:05:13.868 --> 01:05:15.828
No. she did.

663
01:05:15.996 --> 01:05:20.916
And it's true. The only reason why
we were moving was because of me.

664
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:25.379
They thought that my friends
were a bad influence.

665
01:05:26.298 --> 01:05:30.009
But l was the bad influence.

666
01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:37.558
It's just all really fucked up.

667
01:05:38.059 --> 01:05:40.477
You know. when l was a shorty...

668
01:05:41.187 --> 01:05:43.647
...the only time my old man
ever gave me attention...

669
01:05:43.815 --> 01:05:46.191
...is when I did something bad.

670
01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:49.194
-So you know what I did. right?
-What?

671
01:05:49.362 --> 01:05:51.530
I got really good at being bad.

672
01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:57.536
The problem is. when you get older...

673
01:05:57.704 --> 01:05:59.038
...and you have a family...

674
01:06:00.332 --> 01:06:02.833
...being bad is not so good anymore.

675
01:06:17.307 --> 01:06:19.350
Hey. is it over?

676
01:06:25.774 --> 01:06:30.319
-Are we back in business?
-No. I don't think so.

677
01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:45.876
-You better get downstairs.
-No. No. I can handle it.

678
01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:49.797
-No. get downstairs.
-No. I can handle it.

679
01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:54.301
Take this just in case.

680
01:06:59.224 --> 01:07:00.974
Get ready.

681
01:07:04.437 --> 01:07:05.604
Stay.

682
01:07:10.443 --> 01:07:11.944
Wait a minute.

683
01:07:12.112 --> 01:07:14.655
Kyle. are they...?

684
01:07:23.748 --> 01:07:24.790
Kyle.

685
01:07:32.173 --> 01:07:33.465
It's a trap.

686
01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:37.594
It's a trap! They seen them coming
and they turned the lights on!

687
01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:42.433
Hey! Get back in your car!
Get back in your car!

688
01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:45.853
Dad!

689
01:07:48.148 --> 01:07:49.690
They're not gonna make it!

690
01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:53.318
-Get back in your car!
-Back in the car!

691
01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:07.875
Yeah.

692
01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:14.006
Stop!

693
01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:16.049
Stop! You're gonna hit them too!

694
01:08:28.855 --> 01:08:31.106
What the hell is that guy doing?

695
01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:40.949
Don't open the door.
If you do. we all die.

696
01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:50.042
-Please. let me go.
-Come on. I got you.

697
01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:56.298
Now what?

698
01:08:56.883 --> 01:08:58.091
Now what. huh?

699
01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:09.812
Fooled you!

700
01:09:10.021 --> 01:09:11.271
Kyle!

701
01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:15.567
Damn it to hell!

702
01:09:19.322 --> 01:09:21.615
Oh. God. Audrey.

703
01:09:30.333 --> 01:09:31.750
You're gonna die now.

704
01:09:37.507 --> 01:09:39.591
She's just a kid.
You can't just let her die.

705
01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:43.887
I swear. if you don't do something.
I will.

706
01:09:53.231 --> 01:09:56.275
Wait. You stay here.

707
01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.404
Open the door.

708
01:10:44.824 --> 01:10:47.159
Come on! Go!

709
01:10:50.288 --> 01:10:51.330
I'll get some water.

710
01:10:51.497 --> 01:10:54.291
-Jeep.
-ln here! ln here!

711
01:11:01.674 --> 01:11:04.343
Don't be scared.
I just wanna play with your baby.

712
01:11:06.054 --> 01:11:07.512
Stop! Get off of her!

713
01:11:29.994 --> 01:11:33.455
-Are you hurt?
-Where is he? Where is he?

714
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:56.603
What the hell?

715
01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:10.325
Oh. God.

716
01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.162
It's coming.

717
01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:21.670
Wait. Just because l'm a girl
does not mean l know how to do this.

718
01:12:21.838 --> 01:12:25.048
-Stay calm and do exactly as I tell you.
-How do you know what to do?

719
01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:34.766
What a way to bring a child
into the world.

720
01:12:43.735 --> 01:12:45.986
-What the fuck is that?
-He's coming.

721
01:12:46.154 --> 01:12:47.612
We need to hurry now. Charlie.

722
01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.948
This isn't exactly something
we can hurry.

723
01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:54.036
I need you to push now. You push like
you've never pushed before. Push.

724
01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:57.122
-Michael. who is coming?
-Push!

725
01:13:12.305 --> 01:13:15.140
How many bullets you got left?

726
01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:19.728
Come on. That's it. Good.

727
01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.818
Charlie. you did it. Charlie. you--

728
01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:29.988
You did it.

729
01:13:40.374 --> 01:13:44.544
Here's your baby. No. it's okay.
Your baby's fine. Look.

730
01:13:44.712 --> 01:13:46.588
She's all right.

731
01:13:46.881 --> 01:13:48.507
Give her some time.

732
01:13:55.139 --> 01:13:56.473
-Audrey.
-Hi.

733
01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:59.059
Look. Mom. we did it.

734
01:13:59.811 --> 01:14:02.354
The baby's alive.

735
01:14:04.524 --> 01:14:05.732
He's beautiful.

736
01:14:09.362 --> 01:14:12.239
I remember when you were a baby.

737
01:14:12.406 --> 01:14:15.408
You used to look at me just like that.

738
01:14:15.701 --> 01:14:17.869
Just like that.

739
01:14:20.832 --> 01:14:24.167
Audrey. l'm sorry about what I said
to you before. I didn't mean it.

740
01:14:24.335 --> 01:14:25.377
I know.

741
01:14:25.545 --> 01:14:28.547
You're the most precious thing
in the world to me. You know that.

742
01:14:28.714 --> 01:14:30.298
Yeah.

743
01:14:31.050 --> 01:14:33.343
It's just you and me now.

744
01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:35.929
I know.

745
01:14:40.852 --> 01:14:43.103
Are we safe now?

746
01:14:43.688 --> 01:14:48.483
No.

747
01:14:50.111 --> 01:14:54.573
But now at least the child
will have a chance to grow up.

748
01:14:56.033 --> 01:14:59.286
A chance to lead the world
out of darkness.

749
01:15:00.788 --> 01:15:03.331
What happens until then?

750
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:07.335
You need to show him how.

751
01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:12.340
What makes you think
I can do that?

752
01:15:13.259 --> 01:15:16.428
What makes you think
I want to do that?

753
01:15:18.723 --> 01:15:21.683
If he's so important.
why don't you take him?

754
01:15:28.566 --> 01:15:31.610
Because this journey is yours.

755
01:16:04.352 --> 01:16:06.061
-Something's happening.
-We need to go.

756
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:08.146
The possessed can't
come near the child...

757
01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:10.482
...but he sent someone who can.
someone like me.

758
01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:13.318
-Like you?
-Gabriel.

759
01:16:13.486 --> 01:16:15.237
He's come here to do
what I wouldn't.

760
01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:18.490
You were the one
that was supposed to kill the baby.

761
01:16:18.658 --> 01:16:20.825
That's the order you didn't obey.

762
01:16:21.285 --> 01:16:23.161
-We need to go.
-What is he talking about?

763
01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:25.664
-Gather up weapons.
-What are you talking about?

764
01:16:25.831 --> 01:16:28.541
-We need to go now. Now!
-Michael. answer me!

765
01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:33.588
The baby.

766
01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:36.925
The baby
was never meant to be born.

767
01:16:40.179 --> 01:16:44.266
But the future has been unwritten.
The child lives.

768
01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:47.811
And while he does. there's still hope.

769
01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:51.022
Audrey. the baby.

770
01:16:53.526 --> 01:16:54.526
-Mom!
-Audrey. come.

771
01:16:54.694 --> 01:16:56.361
-What are you doing?
-You heard.

772
01:16:56.529 --> 01:17:00.282
They just want the baby. l'll give them
the baby. then they're gonna let us go.

773
01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:02.784
-You give him back to me right now.
-Why?

774
01:17:02.952 --> 01:17:05.620
You didn't even want him
in the first place.

775
01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:12.544
Come on. Audrey.
Audrey. come with me!

776
01:17:18.050 --> 01:17:22.637
It's just one baby.

777
01:17:42.908 --> 01:17:44.075
Oh. shit!

778
01:17:55.921 --> 01:17:57.088
Here! Here!

779
01:18:08.768 --> 01:18:10.393
No!

780
01:18:10.728 --> 01:18:13.104
-Don't. Jeep! No!
-Dad!

781
01:18:13.272 --> 01:18:16.900
No! The child.
Get the child out of here.

782
01:18:17.068 --> 01:18:19.277
-What about you?
-Don't be afraid.

783
01:18:21.322 --> 01:18:24.115
Find the prophets.
Learn to read the instructions.

784
01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:27.577
Prophets? What prophets?
What instructions?

785
01:18:27.745 --> 01:18:28.828
Go!

786
01:18:39.131 --> 01:18:41.257
Let's keep moving.

787
01:18:58.776 --> 01:19:01.986
I knew he'd send you. Gabriel.

788
01:19:03.614 --> 01:19:06.157
You were always so eager
to please him.

789
01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:08.785
Unlike you...

790
01:19:09.787 --> 01:19:12.455
...the rebellious son.

791
01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:26.678
Your wings.

792
01:19:29.181 --> 01:19:30.807
They would have helped you now.

793
01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:34.936
To not feel their burden is a dream.

794
01:19:44.989 --> 01:19:47.866
Do you think you can defy him...

795
01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:50.660
...and not pay the price?

796
01:19:51.829 --> 01:19:53.663
The child lives.

797
01:19:55.082 --> 01:19:56.833
He lives.

798
01:19:58.127 --> 01:20:00.295
It doesn't matter
what happens to me.

799
01:20:09.555 --> 01:20:12.974
Yours is a fool's sacrifice. Michael.

800
01:20:13.559 --> 01:20:17.395
You can help them run.
but they won't escape.

801
01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:21.024
Neither will you. my brother.

802
01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:24.861
I'm not running anymore.

803
01:20:37.666 --> 01:20:40.001
It's enough.

804
01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:44.464
There's another way.

805
01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:05.276
There is no other way.

806
01:23:05.856 --> 01:23:07.607
That's enough.

807
01:23:15.949 --> 01:23:18.451
Gabriel. that's enough.

808
01:23:49.274 --> 01:23:53.778
You wanted to live like one of them.

809
01:23:59.326 --> 01:24:02.120
Now you'll die like one of them.

810
01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:26.310
Jeep.

811
01:24:26.937 --> 01:24:28.104
Your arm.

812
01:24:32.776 --> 01:24:34.152
The instructions.

813
01:24:50.669 --> 01:24:51.836
Sorry.

814
01:24:53.338 --> 01:24:55.006
We're out of business.

815
01:25:18.363 --> 01:25:19.864
Hey. guys. we're here.

816
01:25:22.618 --> 01:25:25.453
Okay. We need to figure out
our weapon situation.

817
01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:29.832
Hopefully. Michael didn't take
everything out of the car. Look around.

818
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:33.544
I've got a flare gun
and a couple of flares.

819
01:25:45.224 --> 01:25:47.391
-Jeep.
-Duck!

820
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:52.730
Audrey. the flare gun!

821
01:26:03.659 --> 01:26:04.909
Audrey.

822
01:26:12.918 --> 01:26:14.126
Charlie. get down!

823
01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:24.220
Get off of her!

824
01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:28.140
Jeep. do it!

825
01:26:30.269 --> 01:26:31.936
Do it!

826
01:26:59.298 --> 01:27:00.923
Jeep.

827
01:27:02.926 --> 01:27:05.469
-The baby?
-Alive.

828
01:27:08.015 --> 01:27:09.640
Jeep.

829
01:27:14.938 --> 01:27:16.898
Audrey?

830
01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:39.754
Oh. shit.

831
01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:57.730
Give me the child.

832
01:28:03.487 --> 01:28:04.946
No.

833
01:28:08.533 --> 01:28:10.368
Then death will come to you both.

834
01:28:11.745 --> 01:28:17.625
No!

835
01:28:25.133 --> 01:28:27.718
Why do you continue to fight...

836
01:28:29.221 --> 01:28:31.722
...when you know all hope is lost?

837
01:28:38.563 --> 01:28:40.147
Fuck you.

838
01:28:49.574 --> 01:28:53.619
This can't be. You've disobeyed him.

839
01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:56.038
You gave him what he asked for.

840
01:28:57.833 --> 01:28:59.709
I gave him what he needed.

841
01:29:27.738 --> 01:29:29.321
Do it.

842
01:29:34.703 --> 01:29:35.786
Do it!

843
01:29:39.666 --> 01:29:41.000
No.

844
01:29:48.050 --> 01:29:50.217
I would not have shown you
such mercy.

845
01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:53.804
I know.

846
01:29:54.473 --> 01:29:56.057
That's why you failed him.

847
01:30:11.865 --> 01:30:12.907
They're waiting.

848
01:30:14.659 --> 01:30:15.659
Where are you going?

849
01:30:15.827 --> 01:30:18.454
You're the true protector.
You always have been.

850
01:30:18.622 --> 01:30:21.082
Will we ever see you again?

851
01:30:21.249 --> 01:30:22.958
Have faith.

852
01:31:57.804 --> 01:32:00.472
When l was a little girl...

853
01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:03.100
...my mother spoke of a prophecy...

854
01:32:03.268 --> 01:32:06.145
...of a time when all the world
would be covered in darkness...

855
01:32:06.313 --> 01:32:08.772
...and the fate of mankind
would be decided.

856
01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:11.609
One night. I finally got up the courage
to ask my mother...

857
01:32:11.776 --> 01:32:13.944
...why God was so mad
at his children.

858
01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:20.910
"I don't know." she said.
tucking the covers around me.

859
01:32:22.204 --> 01:32:24.788
"l guess he just got tired
of all the bullshit."
