3
00:01:15.814 --> 00:01:19.862
I would say the biggest hurdle for me.

4
00:01:22.386 --> 00:01:24.736
is gettin' past the
embarrassment of it all.

5
00:01:28.131 --> 00:01:30.481
It's hard to talk about who I used to be.

6
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.096
Not a day goes by

7
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.230
that I'm not grateful.

8
00:01:40.404 --> 00:01:43.320
I mean. I mean to my bones

9
00:01:44.974 --> 00:01:46.584
about how my life turned around.

10
00:01:53.504 --> 00:01:54.331
Shoot.

11
00:01:56.377 --> 00:01:58.944
We've been into some pretty
dark places together.

12
00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:03.340
I mean.

13
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.736
you turned it around.

14
00:02:09.607 --> 00:02:11.131
made a life for yourself.

15
00:02:16.223 --> 00:02:18.355
I guess I just wanted to know

16
00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.186
how you did that?

17
00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:32.326
You hear these rare stories. you know?

18
00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.066
Of how the impossible happened.

19
00:02:37.461 --> 00:02:38.288
Well.

20
00:02:40.203 --> 00:02:42.510
this is one of those stories.

21
00:03:13.932 --> 00:03:16.848
Hey!

22
00:03:50.534 --> 00:03:54.277
It was the 1950s. but if
you pulled up to our yard.

23
00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:57.019
you would've thought it was the 1850s.

24
00:03:57.193 --> 00:03:59.413
That's how poor we were.

25
00:03:59.587 --> 00:04:02.198
Dad spent most of his time
workin' in the oil fields.

26
00:04:02.372 --> 00:04:04.069
I wish you didn't always have to go.

27
00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.594
Hell. that's life. Phil.

28
00:04:06.768 --> 00:04:08.030
It's time you grew up.

29
00:04:12.034 --> 00:04:13.601
Take care of things around here.

30
00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:16.168
You got it?

31
00:04:16.343 --> 00:04:17.213
Yes. sir.

32
00:04:24.568 --> 00:04:25.395
Who's a man?

33
00:04:27.658 --> 00:04:29.094
I'm a man.

34
00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.358
Mama provided a different
set of challenges.

35
00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:35.362
- When she had one of her spells.
- Mom. stop it!

36
00:04:35.536 --> 00:04:36.276
- Get outta here!
- You'll go back

37
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:37.059
to the hospital again!

38
00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:38.626
Get out!

39
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.844
All we could really
do is get outta the way.

40
00:04:40.018 --> 00:04:40.802
No one's takin' me to the hospital.

41
00:04:40.976 --> 00:04:42.151
You gotta calm down!

42
00:04:42.325 --> 00:04:43.761
Please!

43
00:04:43.935 --> 00:04:45.067
Get outta here!

44
00:04:45.241 --> 00:04:46.111
Go!

45
00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:51.203
I started at a
young age. a very young age.

46
00:04:53.336 --> 00:04:55.120
Come to the woods and bringin'
back somethin' you could eat.

47
00:04:57.079 --> 00:05:00.604
Squirrel. ducks. quail.
doves. whatever was there.

48
00:05:01.953 --> 00:05:03.215
The woods became my home.

49
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.263
Sometimes I would just
sit there for hours.

50
00:05:07.437 --> 00:05:08.525
listen to the woods.

51
00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.182
They would talk and I
would try and talk back.

52
00:05:17.752 --> 00:05:19.057
I could get lost in them.

53
00:05:20.755 --> 00:05:22.278
They were my refuge.

54
00:05:25.368 --> 00:05:30.373
But sooner or later. the real
world always comes knockin'.

55
00:06:16.941 --> 00:06:18.552
No. no!

56
00:06:18.726 --> 00:06:20.292
No. no!
- Phil!

57
00:06:20.467 --> 00:06:21.642
They're takin' her away again!
- You can't make me!

58
00:06:21.816 --> 00:06:24.035
You can't make me. you can't!

59
00:06:24.209 --> 00:06:25.385
No!

60
00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:26.473
Phil!

61
00:06:26.647 --> 00:06:27.561
Phil. don't let 'em take me!

62
00:06:27.735 --> 00:06:29.171
She ain't done nothin' wrong!

63
00:06:29.345 --> 00:06:31.695
Judy. Judy [screams]!

64
00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:33.305
Phil. Phil. Phil!

65
00:06:35.438 --> 00:06:38.528
Mom [sobs]!

66
00:06:38.702 --> 00:06:39.486
Phil!

67
00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.662
Phil. Phil [sobs]!

68
00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:04.772
She was gone for months at a time.

69
00:07:04.946 --> 00:07:06.295
Mama?

70
00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:07.992
While they tried the
only medicine they had.

71
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:11.126
shock treatment.

72
00:07:12.344 --> 00:07:13.345
Mama?

73
00:07:24.966 --> 00:07:25.923
Why does she keep doin' this stuff

74
00:07:26.097 --> 00:07:27.447
if she knows they'll lock her up?

75
00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:30.319
She can't help it.

76
00:07:30.493 --> 00:07:31.886
It's in her blood or somethin'.

77
00:07:33.061 --> 00:07:34.454
We got that blood in us?

78
00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:38.109
Don't know.

79
00:07:38.283 --> 00:07:40.024
but we'll always look out
for each other. won't we?

80
00:07:40.938 --> 00:07:42.244
You mean that. Phil?

81
00:07:44.246 --> 00:07:45.334
Of course I do. Jan.

82
00:07:47.118 --> 00:07:48.816
Si. go get some taters
from under the house.

83
00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:50.078
Nah. nah. nah.

84
00:07:50.252 --> 00:07:52.384
Hey. last time that possum ran after me.

85
00:07:52.559 --> 00:07:54.996
his teeth were like this big.

86
00:08:00.828 --> 00:08:01.872
I didn't know it at the time.

87
00:08:02.046 --> 00:08:04.614
but just up the road a few miles lived

88
00:08:04.788 --> 00:08:05.963
a girl who would soon become

89
00:08:06.137 --> 00:08:08.836
the most important person in my life.

90
00:08:11.316 --> 00:08:12.448
Kay Carroway.

91
00:08:13.797 --> 00:08:14.798
Oh. damn it!

92
00:08:14.972 --> 00:08:16.408
Language. Mom!

93
00:08:16.583 --> 00:08:17.845
Kay. pick up your toys.
they nearly killed me.

94
00:08:18.019 --> 00:08:19.673
and then you go get those over there.

95
00:08:19.847 --> 00:08:21.283
- Compared to us.
- Stay on your feet.

96
00:08:21.457 --> 00:08:22.806
- Kay was rich.
- gonna be stockin'

97
00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:23.590
the store tonight. and I
can't do it without you.

98
00:08:23.764 --> 00:08:24.852
Oh-

99
00:08:25.026 --> 00:08:26.027
They owned the general store in town.

100
00:08:26.201 --> 00:08:28.508
so we equated that with filthy rich.

101
00:08:28.682 --> 00:08:31.554
Y'all could close stores on
Sundays and come to church.

102
00:08:31.728 --> 00:08:33.600
It'd be good for your soul. Daddy.

103
00:08:33.774 --> 00:08:36.080
Sunday's our best day. Katie-bug.

104
00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:38.822
You may say a prayer for us.

105
00:08:38.996 --> 00:08:40.607
especially about sellin'
them three roasts today

106
00:08:40.781 --> 00:08:43.305
before I have to throw 'em
out and lose money on 'em.

107
00:08:44.175 --> 00:08:45.046
Hey?

108
00:08:46.308 --> 00:08:47.483
Don't you get caught readin'

109
00:08:47.657 --> 00:08:50.051
them pioneer books in church again.

110
00:08:52.009 --> 00:08:53.837
Just in case.

111
00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:55.447
"Little House on the
Prairie." new edition.

112
00:08:55.622 --> 00:08:57.145
I don't have this one [laughs].

113
00:08:57.319 --> 00:08:58.102
I know [chuckles].

114
00:08:58.276 --> 00:08:59.234
Says there's all kinds

115
00:08:59.408 --> 00:09:00.844
of new maps and drawings in there.

116
00:09:01.018 --> 00:09:01.976
Thanks. Daddy.

117
00:09:05.675 --> 00:09:08.069
Kay wasn't like the other kids.

118
00:09:08.243 --> 00:09:09.418
They judged us.

119
00:09:10.288 --> 00:09:11.463
She didn't.

120
00:09:20.734 --> 00:09:23.171
I guess she saw somethin' else.

121
00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.306
Look like the riff-raff's
blowing in from the field.

122
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.482
Y'all should be ashamed of yourselves.

123
00:09:31.483 --> 00:09:34.138
Wowie. look at this.

124
00:09:34.312 --> 00:09:35.575
What are these called?

125
00:09:35.749 --> 00:09:36.706
Hubcaps.

126
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:38.360
Dang!

127
00:09:38.534 --> 00:09:40.275
Pa's truck ain't never had these.

128
00:09:41.842 --> 00:09:44.018
Must be a load of
millionaires here in town.

129
00:09:47.978 --> 00:09:49.066
Turns out there was somethin'

130
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.155
besides huntin' I was actually good at.

131
00:09:52.330 --> 00:09:53.288
I was born with it.

132
00:09:54.942 --> 00:09:57.597
That's how I became the
high school quarterback.

133
00:10:04.691 --> 00:10:06.736
Down. set. hut!

134
00:10:23.666 --> 00:10:24.711
Hey. way to play fellas.

135
00:10:24.885 --> 00:10:25.842
You gotta stop runnin' like that.

136
00:10:26.016 --> 00:10:27.627
You put me out of a job.

137
00:10:27.801 --> 00:10:28.715
Pretty sure you gotta get on the field

138
00:10:28.889 --> 00:10:31.456
before you can lose that job. son.

139
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:33.458
Talk about your pioneer man. Kay.

140
00:10:34.285 --> 00:10:35.983
Maybe he'll walk you off
the field after the game.

141
00:10:36.157 --> 00:10:37.593
Phil Robertson. the quarterback?

142
00:10:37.767 --> 00:10:39.247
You gotta be kiddin' me.

143
00:10:39.421 --> 00:10:41.031
I seen the way he looks at you.

144
00:10:41.205 --> 00:10:42.642
Hey. Phil
Robertson. can I get a statement?

145
00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:44.861
Nah. nah.

146
00:10:45.035 --> 00:10:46.471
You wanna talk to Si Robertson right here.

147
00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:47.821
Real hero of the game.

148
00:10:47.995 --> 00:10:48.909
Si Robertson?

149
00:10:49.083 --> 00:10:50.562
Did you even play?

150
00:10:50.737 --> 00:10:52.303
Boy. did I even play?

151
00:10:52.477 --> 00:10:54.044
I was so fast like lightning.

152
00:10:54.218 --> 00:10:55.306
that's why it probably didn't even feel

153
00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:57.004
like you saw me out there on that field.

154
00:10:57.178 --> 00:10:59.006
Miss Kay Carroway.

155
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.094
Hey. Phil.

156
00:11:00.268 --> 00:11:01.182
Hey.

157
00:11:02.313 --> 00:11:03.924
Look. I know we don't know
each other all that well.

158
00:11:04.098 --> 00:11:07.449
but think maybe I could walk
you off the field tonight?

159
00:11:07.623 --> 00:11:08.319
I'd like that.

160
00:11:09.712 --> 00:11:10.713
Okay.

161
00:11:10.887 --> 00:11:12.323
So we walked off the field together

162
00:11:12.497 --> 00:11:14.021
and she offered me a ride home.

163
00:11:14.891 --> 00:11:16.458
I didn't even have the luxury of goin'

164
00:11:16.632 --> 00:11:18.721
on my first date without
at least one third wheel.

165
00:11:18.895 --> 00:11:20.288
And that's when I went down to pet

166
00:11:20.462 --> 00:11:22.812
what I thought was a
dog. and no way. okay?

167
00:11:22.986 --> 00:11:25.119
Turned out it was a five-pound squirrel.

168
00:11:25.293 --> 00:11:26.686
Sorry about this.

169
00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.818
I mean. I really do despise beavers.

170
00:11:28.992 --> 00:11:32.039
but I also respect their
work ethic and determination.

171
00:11:36.565 --> 00:11:37.871
You're gonna stay in the car.

172
00:11:38.045 --> 00:11:39.916
- What do you mean?
- This is my date.

173
00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:41.178
so you're stayin'.

174
00:11:41.352 --> 00:11:43.050
I'll be skin and bone if I don't eat.

175
00:11:43.224 --> 00:11:44.138
I hate to break it to ya.
honey. but you already are.

176
00:11:44.312 --> 00:11:46.227
Hey Jack. I am wastin' away.

177
00:11:46.401 --> 00:11:47.358
All right. fine. fine.

178
00:11:47.532 --> 00:11:48.882
Quit your yappin'.

179
00:11:49.056 --> 00:11:49.578
I'll get you somethin'.
but you're stayin' here.

180
00:11:49.752 --> 00:11:50.622
All right.

181
00:11:54.235 --> 00:11:55.062
All right.

182
00:11:58.195 --> 00:11:59.675
Sorry about that.

183
00:11:59.849 --> 00:12:01.546
♪ Yeah. yeah. yeah. yeah ♪

184
00:12:12.601 --> 00:12:13.950
I know girls are supposed to act

185
00:12:14.124 --> 00:12:15.038
like they don't eat
nothin' on these dates.

186
00:12:15.212 --> 00:12:17.649
but I am absolutely starvin'.

187
00:12:17.824 --> 00:12:18.520
Hey. Rachel?

188
00:12:18.694 --> 00:12:20.217
Hey. Kay.

189
00:12:20.391 --> 00:12:22.089
Could I get two muffy
sandwiches and a large fry?

190
00:12:22.263 --> 00:12:23.133
What you want? I can pay.

191
00:12:23.307 --> 00:12:24.091
Hey. no. come on.

192
00:12:24.265 --> 00:12:26.397
You drove. I got this.

193
00:12:29.661 --> 00:12:31.751
Uh. you know. I don't really
eat after the games anyway.

194
00:12:31.925 --> 00:12:34.405
so I think I'm just gonna
get something for Si. so.

195
00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:36.451
You know what?

196
00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:38.409
I changed my mind.

197
00:12:38.583 --> 00:12:39.976
Could you just gimme one of
those single grilled cheeses.

198
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:42.196
and Rachel. you owe me
a fry from last week.

199
00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:43.675
so don't go cheatin' out on me again.

200
00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:45.460
Okay.

201
00:12:45.634 --> 00:12:47.375
Fries are for skinny bones.

202
00:12:51.074 --> 00:12:52.119
In those days.

203
00:12:52.293 --> 00:12:53.250
it was a nightmare dealin' with Mama.

204
00:12:53.424 --> 00:12:55.078
Where is it?

205
00:12:55.252 --> 00:12:57.820
When she was good. she was
great. Funny. sharp. kind.

206
00:12:57.994 --> 00:12:59.300
Ma. what are you lookin' for?

207
00:12:59.474 --> 00:13:00.780
The money.

208
00:13:00.954 --> 00:13:02.390
Where's the money?

209
00:13:02.564 --> 00:13:03.608
I keep tellin' you.
we ain't got no money.

210
00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.828
At least not in the way you're sayin'.

211
00:13:06.002 --> 00:13:07.047
Oh no. from your pa.

212
00:13:07.221 --> 00:13:08.439
He's been sendin' it.

213
00:13:08.613 --> 00:13:10.224
But when it wasn't her day-

214
00:13:10.398 --> 00:13:11.660
I got back
from the hospital and-

215
00:13:11.834 --> 00:13:13.705
Life was hell for all of us.

216
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.577
Yes. Mama. and Pa did send it.

217
00:13:15.751 --> 00:13:16.796
We've been usin' it.

218
00:13:16.970 --> 00:13:18.145
Jan needed actual clothes for school.

219
00:13:18.319 --> 00:13:20.364
Si needed shoes for football.

220
00:13:20.538 --> 00:13:22.758
Everything around us costs money.

221
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:27.284
Why are you wearing that?

222
00:13:27.458 --> 00:13:28.546
Why are you all dressed up?

223
00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:32.812
'Cause I got a date tonight.

224
00:13:34.291 --> 00:13:36.250
You got a date [laughs]?

225
00:13:36.424 --> 00:13:38.774
Oh. baby. with who. huh?

226
00:13:41.516 --> 00:13:42.778
Kay Carroway.

227
00:13:46.608 --> 00:13:47.565
Carroway?

228
00:13:50.046 --> 00:13:52.135
That rich family in town?

229
00:13:54.964 --> 00:13:56.226
Well. that's nice.

230
00:14:00.187 --> 00:14:03.625
You gonna leave me. Phil [sobbing]?

231
00:14:03.799 --> 00:14:05.235
You gonna leave me. Phil?

232
00:14:05.409 --> 00:14:06.715
Is that what you're gonna do?

233
00:14:06.889 --> 00:14:07.542
- I'm not leave-
- You gonna leave me?

234
00:14:07.716 --> 00:14:09.196
I'm not leavin'!

235
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.941
Don't go.

236
00:14:15.115 --> 00:14:16.116
Don't go.

237
00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.988
Don't go like your father [sobbing].

238
00:14:26.778 --> 00:14:29.259
- Hey.
- Hey. you ready to go?

239
00:14:31.044 --> 00:14:31.871
What's wrong?

240
00:14:33.002 --> 00:14:33.698
Nothin'.

241
00:14:33.873 --> 00:14:35.483
Everything's fine.

242
00:14:35.657 --> 00:14:36.397
No. I can tell you look
like you've seen a ghost.

243
00:14:36.571 --> 00:14:37.441
What...

244
00:14:38.573 --> 00:14:40.662
Oh. my Mama's been
actin' up again is all.

245
00:14:40.836 --> 00:14:42.229
but it's fine. we got our date tonight.

246
00:14:42.403 --> 00:14:43.230
It's...

247
00:14:45.841 --> 00:14:46.973
There's just a lot goin' on.

248
00:14:47.147 --> 00:14:50.019
Hey. whoa. it's okay.

249
00:14:50.193 --> 00:14:51.716
We can figure it out together.

250
00:14:52.804 --> 00:14:53.631
No. no. all right?

251
00:14:53.805 --> 00:14:55.459
You shouldn't...

252
00:14:55.633 --> 00:14:56.939
No. you're not gonna have
to deal with any of this.

253
00:14:57.113 --> 00:14:58.462
Hey. who needs another
muffy at Fertitta's?

254
00:14:58.636 --> 00:14:59.811
I've got an idea.

255
00:15:03.206 --> 00:15:05.034
Thank you again for bringin' all this.

256
00:15:05.208 --> 00:15:06.949
Well. just because my
parents own a grocery store

257
00:15:07.123 --> 00:15:08.820
don't mean I know how
to cook anything in it.

258
00:15:08.995 --> 00:15:11.084
Well. honey. that I can teach.

259
00:15:11.258 --> 00:15:12.607
Always start with some butter here.

260
00:15:12.781 --> 00:15:14.348
baby. okay?

261
00:15:14.522 --> 00:15:15.915
Give us a snack. all right?

262
00:15:16.089 --> 00:15:17.307
No one-
- Coca-Cola?

263
00:15:17.481 --> 00:15:19.440
Dang. she is rich.
- Jan!

264
00:15:19.614 --> 00:15:20.484
Where's the tea?

265
00:15:22.573 --> 00:15:23.792
Hey. grab me somethin'. would ya?

266
00:15:23.966 --> 00:15:25.098
Hey. I hear that.

267
00:15:25.272 --> 00:15:26.926
You steal a bite before it's ready.

268
00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.405
I'm gonna swat you upside
the head with this spatula.

269
00:15:31.147 --> 00:15:32.932
Hand me those beans. will ya?

270
00:15:33.106 --> 00:15:35.804
Okay. so make sure this is lump free.

271
00:15:35.978 --> 00:15:37.458
- Smells good.
- Thank you.

272
00:15:37.632 --> 00:15:39.851
now get out [chuckles].

273
00:15:40.026 --> 00:15:43.246
Okay. take one of these and make sure

274
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:45.596
that's against the knives.

275
00:15:46.989 --> 00:15:48.556
Soaked up with flour.

276
00:15:49.470 --> 00:15:50.558
However you wanna do that.

277
00:15:50.732 --> 00:15:52.299
I do it kinda messy. but some people...

278
00:15:56.694 --> 00:15:59.001
Kay. thank you for tonight.

279
00:16:01.047 --> 00:16:02.135
It really meant a lot to my mama.

280
00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:05.660
and though she probably won't admit it.

281
00:16:07.314 --> 00:16:09.969
she really misses my pa
when he's on the job.

282
00:16:10.143 --> 00:16:11.622
Yeah. yeah.

283
00:16:11.796 --> 00:16:13.059
You know. she seemed okay.

284
00:16:14.495 --> 00:16:16.888
There's this other
side to her. you know?

285
00:16:17.063 --> 00:16:18.194
And you can't predict it.

286
00:16:18.368 --> 00:16:19.804
It just kinda-

287
00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:21.850
You ain't never have
to be ashamed of that.

288
00:16:24.418 --> 00:16:25.941
Wait. shh. shh.

289
00:16:26.115 --> 00:16:27.160
- What is it?
- Hear that?

290
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.643
That's a pintail.

291
00:16:40.347 --> 00:16:42.044
You love it out here.

292
00:16:43.176 --> 00:16:44.003
I do.

293
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:47.180
It is beautiful.

294
00:16:54.535 --> 00:16:56.667
We can get a place out here. you and I.

295
00:16:57.668 --> 00:16:58.669
a little shack up on the river

296
00:16:58.843 --> 00:17:00.628
and I could spend my days fishin'.

297
00:17:01.672 --> 00:17:03.065
I...

298
00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.243
I'm sorry.

299
00:17:08.723 --> 00:17:10.594
A girl like you definitely
don't wanna spend

300
00:17:10.768 --> 00:17:11.682
her time like that.

301
00:17:13.989 --> 00:17:16.818
My dad used to read me
pioneer stories every night.

302
00:17:16.992 --> 00:17:18.646
What's a pioneer story?

303
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:20.996
You know. like movin' out
west. livin' off the land.

304
00:17:21.170 --> 00:17:23.259
makin' your own butter. that kinda thing.

305
00:17:24.173 --> 00:17:26.349
There's always a good love story too.

306
00:17:26.523 --> 00:17:27.916
I used to go to bed dreamin'

307
00:17:28.090 --> 00:17:30.136
about how amazin' that
kinda life would be.

308
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:34.227
So. yeah. a little place by the
river would be just the thing.

309
00:17:36.751 --> 00:17:39.362
You really are the perfect
woman. Miss Kay Carroway.

310
00:17:43.584 --> 00:17:46.065
Kay fell right in with my family.

311
00:17:46.239 --> 00:17:48.719
In my mind. we were a perfect fit.

312
00:17:51.548 --> 00:17:53.942
Phil has been an All-State
quarterback this year.

313
00:17:54.116 --> 00:17:55.204
They've been saying he's gonna

314
00:17:55.378 --> 00:17:56.814
get lots of offers from colleges to play.

315
00:17:56.988 --> 00:18:00.557
Football is such a rough sport to me.

316
00:18:00.731 --> 00:18:02.385
Seems like a waste of time.

317
00:18:02.559 --> 00:18:05.606
I mean. are they gonna pay
you a lot of money to play?

318
00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.912
I'm sure they got scholarships and such.

319
00:18:08.087 --> 00:18:09.349
Am I right. Phil?

320
00:18:09.523 --> 00:18:10.698
Oh. yes. Sir.

321
00:18:10.872 --> 00:18:12.003
Yes. Ma'am.

322
00:18:12.178 --> 00:18:14.397
See. there you go. Wanita.

323
00:18:16.486 --> 00:18:18.706
You know. that reminds me.

324
00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:22.188
Kay. guess who came into the store today?

325
00:18:24.233 --> 00:18:25.974
Mrs. Watson.

326
00:18:26.148 --> 00:18:28.933
Now. her boy is nearly
outta medical school.

327
00:18:29.108 --> 00:18:31.022
A doctor. you know?

328
00:18:31.197 --> 00:18:34.678
And I remember. oo. he
used to come around.

329
00:18:34.852 --> 00:18:36.680
He had eyes for you.

330
00:18:39.466 --> 00:18:41.816
Wanita. you look like
you're runnin' empty there.

331
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.558
Well. so is my beer.

332
00:18:45.602 --> 00:18:47.213
I would love another.

333
00:18:47.387 --> 00:18:48.475
Phil. wait!

334
00:18:48.649 --> 00:18:49.650
I'm sorry about my Mama.

335
00:18:49.824 --> 00:18:50.955
Phil!
- You ain't gotta

336
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:52.479
be polite anymore. Kay.
- Please!

337
00:18:52.653 --> 00:18:54.568
Just. I'm sorry about my Mama. okay?

338
00:18:54.742 --> 00:18:56.265
This not gonna work.

339
00:18:58.137 --> 00:19:00.487
It's huntin' season.
- No.

340
00:19:00.661 --> 00:19:01.792
- I gotta go.
- No [sobs].

341
00:19:09.931 --> 00:19:12.673
So. you just broke up
with her just like that?

342
00:19:13.891 --> 00:19:15.110
It was huntin' season.

343
00:19:19.723 --> 00:19:21.160
- That's a bad move.
- Yep.

344
00:19:22.596 --> 00:19:23.945
One of many.

345
00:19:27.992 --> 00:19:29.298
How'd you get her back then?

346
00:19:29.472 --> 00:19:33.172
Hey!

347
00:19:33.346 --> 00:19:35.348
Now!

348
00:20:13.516 --> 00:20:14.691
Phil!

349
00:20:14.865 --> 00:20:16.127
Phil. it's Kay!

350
00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:31.099
The death of Kay's
father came out of nowhere

351
00:20:31.273 --> 00:20:33.536
and left a big hole in her family.

352
00:20:35.843 --> 00:20:36.713
Kay.

353
00:20:39.194 --> 00:20:40.064
I love you.

354
00:20:41.283 --> 00:20:43.111
I'm sorry for runnin' off like that.

355
00:20:46.549 --> 00:20:47.550
It wasn't long after her daddy died

356
00:20:47.724 --> 00:20:49.726
that her mama spiraled down quickly.

357
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:52.076
She fought a hard battle with alcohol.

358
00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:54.035
and the alcohol eventually won.

359
00:20:54.949 --> 00:20:56.167
I was all she had.

360
00:20:56.342 --> 00:20:59.083
but in a lot of ways she was all I had.

361
00:20:59.954 --> 00:21:00.781

because of my skillset
throwin' a football.

370
00:21:27.982 --> 00:21:30.158
I headed off to Louisiana Tech.

371

Great game. boys!

372
00:21:33.466 --> 00:21:35.250
Kay was only a junior
in high school at the time.

373
00:21:35.424 --> 00:21:37.296
but we had a baby on the way.

374
00:21:38.645 --> 00:21:40.211
and it was pretty rough on Kay.

375
00:21:42.866 --> 00:21:44.825
Tried to balance takin' care of my family

but it was too much.

one that paid enough.

00:32:19.589 --> 00:32:21.287
It's good to see you. sweetheart.

543
00:32:21.461 --> 00:32:22.505

544
00:32:22.679 --> 00:32:24.072

- I'm good. how are you?
- It's good to see you.

546
00:32:25.073 --> 00:32:26.248
You too.

547
00:32:26.422 --> 00:32:27.162
- Hey. hey. how you doin'?
- Hey.

548
00:32:27.336 --> 00:32:28.294
I'm Al.

549
00:32:28.468 --> 00:32:31.079
You must be one of Kay's friends.

550
00:32:31.253 --> 00:32:33.603
I know Phil ain't got
no good lookin' friends.

551
00:32:33.777 --> 00:32:35.301
Well. except for me. of course.

552
00:32:37.042 --> 00:32:37.694
That's my sister.

553
00:32:39.653 --> 00:32:41.307
Okay. okay.

554
00:32:41.481 --> 00:32:42.569
Oh. yeah. okay.

555
00:32:42.743 --> 00:32:43.744
All right.

556
00:32:43.918 --> 00:32:45.789
I mean. I was just bein' friendly.

557
00:32:45.964 --> 00:32:46.877
Why don't you be friendly

558
00:32:47.052 --> 00:32:49.184
in that direction over there. Al?

559
00:32:50.316 --> 00:32:51.143
Okay.

560
00:32:52.405 --> 00:32:54.102
- Sorry about him.
-  No. I'm good.

561
00:32:54.276 --> 00:32:56.191
Hey. congratulations on your new job.

562
00:32:56.365 --> 00:32:57.366
I'm so proud of you.

563
00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:58.846
Thanks. Jan.

564
00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:00.674
Did Kay tell you we took the boys

565
00:33:00.848 --> 00:33:02.110
to church last weekend?

566
00:33:02.284 --> 00:33:03.242
They seemed to really enjoy it.

567
00:33:03.416 --> 00:33:05.026
You should come with us next time.

568
00:33:06.114 --> 00:33:08.421
Yeah. well. I like to spend

569
00:33:08.595 --> 00:33:11.119
my Sunday celebratin' God in other ways.

570
00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:16.124
Who needs a pew when you
can be out in His creation?

571
00:33:16.298 --> 00:33:18.953
Hey. y'all. how 'bout a toast. huh?

572
00:33:20.259 --> 00:33:22.087
To my man Phil Robertson here.

573
00:33:22.261 --> 00:33:26.743
the newest remedial English
teacher at Junction City High.

574
00:33:27.527 --> 00:33:29.050
He ain't smart but he pretty.

575
00:33:31.661 --> 00:33:33.402
I can't do. I can't deal.

576
00:33:33.576 --> 00:33:35.361
- Four ducks?
- Yeah. four ducks.

577
00:33:35.535 --> 00:33:36.579
Four ducks.

578
00:33:36.753 --> 00:33:37.798
One bullet can't take down four ducks.

579
00:33:37.972 --> 00:33:39.234
Oh. it can if you're Phil Robertson.

580
00:33:39.408 --> 00:33:41.106
Who's this new friend with him?

581
00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:42.759
That's Al [throat clears].

582
00:33:44.892 --> 00:33:46.633
He's from his work.

583
00:33:46.807 --> 00:33:48.591
He runs their school.
- Oh. okay.

584
00:33:49.897 --> 00:33:50.854
Yeah. it's that easy.

585
00:33:51.725 --> 00:33:53.031
- Woo ee!
- Woo!

586
00:33:55.946 --> 00:33:56.686
Ow!

587
00:34:03.084 --> 00:34:04.868
Woo!
- Told you boys.

588
00:34:05.043 --> 00:34:07.871
One thing I'm better at
than fishin' is shootin'.

589
00:34:08.742 --> 00:34:09.786
You okay?

590
00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.049
- Yeah.
- This here

591
00:34:11.223 --> 00:34:14.356
is some genuine Three Creeks moonshine.

592
00:34:16.315 --> 00:34:17.185
All right.

593
00:34:28.805 --> 00:34:29.676
Daddy?

594
00:34:32.157 --> 00:34:33.245
You goin' huntin'?

595
00:34:34.202 --> 00:34:35.160
You bet ya.

596
00:34:36.944 --> 00:34:37.814
Can I come?

597
00:34:40.121 --> 00:34:41.470
You don't know the woods.

598
00:34:42.428 --> 00:34:44.256
You don't know huntin'.

599
00:34:44.430 --> 00:34:46.736
You could teach me.

600
00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.745
Go back to bed.

601
00:35:01.664 --> 00:35:04.624

Who's a man?

642
00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.248
I was hell-bent
on doin' things my own way.

643
00:37:31.292 --> 00:37:32.250
I always had been.

644
00:37:36.036 --> 00:37:37.385
So. when I had to figure out other ways

645
00:37:37.559 --> 00:37:39.257
to provide for the family.

646
00:37:39.431 --> 00:37:42.172
I went back to the places
that have always provided.

647
00:37:42.347 --> 00:37:44.436
the woods. and the river.

648
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.501

How's your mama?

654
00:38:21.299 --> 00:38:22.038
She doin' just great.

655

You back on the water?

660
00:38:30.569 --> 00:38:31.744
I thought I heard you teachin' down

661
00:38:31.918 --> 00:38:33.528
at that school in Junction City?

662
00:38:33.702 --> 00:38:35.356
Yeah. yeah.

663
00:38:38.272 --> 00:38:40.405
Sabbatical. you know?

664
00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:43.059
Just a short break.

665
00:38:44.583 --> 00:38:46.193
I got myself plenty for the shop today.

666
00:38:46.367 --> 00:38:49.022
You know I don't like
throwin' out no unsold fish.

667
00:38:49.979 --> 00:38:51.720
This here's as fresh as it comes.

668
00:38:51.894 --> 00:38:54.375
You could put this on
special right up front.

669
00:38:57.857 --> 00:38:59.424
Caught no more than an hour ago.

670
00:39:03.515 --> 00:39:04.733
Have a look.

671
00:39:05.778 --> 00:39:06.953

678
00:39:39.159 --> 00:39:41.335
I'm ashamed to say most of that money

679
00:39:41.509 --> 00:39:44.077
I was makin' didn't go
to Kay and the kids.

680
00:39:44.251 --> 00:39:46.209

681
00:39:50.213 --> 00:39:54.043
Hey. if nothin' else. we were creative.

682
00:39:55.436 --> 00:39:58.221
All right. y'all. all bets are in.

683
00:39:58.396 --> 00:40:01.181
Got a rivalry as old as time.

684
00:40:02.530 --> 00:40:05.228
Man versus machine!

685
00:40:05.403 --> 00:40:07.100
Steel versus muscle!

686
00:40:08.754 --> 00:40:11.452
Rubber versus some bare feet.

687
00:40:11.626 --> 00:40:14.368
- Mm hm!
- Yeah. Phil!

688
00:40:14.542 --> 00:40:17.110

697
00:40:51.144 --> 00:40:53.886
Don't give me that sour look
like I'm tryin' to cheat ya.

698
00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.192
It's Hank's car and he bet against me.

699
00:40:56.366 --> 00:40:58.194
You think he hamstrung his own bet?

700
00:40:59.108 --> 00:41:01.546
Hey. come on. now. pay up.

701
00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:03.025
Fair and square.

Hey. don't be bitter.

703
00:41:07.073 --> 00:41:08.378
You and I both know Hank's car

704
00:41:08.553 --> 00:41:09.989
ain't got the gun to come even close

705
00:41:10.163 --> 00:41:12.600
to outrunnin' you if you
only give him 20 yards.

706
00:41:13.775 --> 00:41:17.213
You give him 25. he's got you smoked.

707
00:41:19.128 --> 00:41:23.742
Well. that's their fault
for not askin' for 25.

708
00:41:27.180 --> 00:41:28.137

710
00:41:29.574 --> 00:41:30.966
Hey. Phil?

711
00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.490
Double or nothin'.

00:41:34.230 --> 00:41:35.884
Hold my beer.

713
00:41:45.111 --> 00:41:46.460

00:41:49.115 --> 00:41:51.552
Guess you decided to finally come home.

715
00:41:52.684 --> 00:41:54.468
I know it's late. I was...

716
00:41:55.556 --> 00:41:57.253

What is this?

721
00:42:16.055 --> 00:42:18.318
That's money I made.

722
00:42:18.492 --> 00:42:20.842
Well. how much fish you sell?

723
00:42:21.016 --> 00:42:22.061
What do you mean?

724
00:42:23.062 --> 00:42:25.064
There's $11 here.

725
00:42:27.545 --> 00:42:31.766
I know. I musta spent
some of it. all right?

726
00:42:34.508 --> 00:42:37.903
Phil. we have three hungry boys.

727
00:42:38.773 --> 00:42:41.559
You put all this pressure on
me to stretch a few dollars.

728
00:42:43.386 --> 00:42:45.911
It is embarrassing havin' a line

729
00:42:46.085 --> 00:42:48.043
of people behind me in
the grocery store waitin'

730
00:42:48.217 --> 00:42:51.090
for me to put stuff back
because I can't afford it.

731
00:42:51.264 --> 00:42:53.179
It's fine.

732
00:42:53.353 --> 00:42:54.876
We're fine.

733
00:42:55.050 --> 00:42:56.704
The kids are fine [chuckles].

734
00:43:00.099 --> 00:43:02.188
I don't think we are. Phil.

735
00:43:06.888 --> 00:43:10.457
Hm. I told you boys. I'm blessed.

736
00:43:10.631 --> 00:43:12.328
I cannot lose.

737
00:43:12.502 --> 00:43:14.374
Jesus don't be playin' no dice.

738
00:43:14.548 --> 00:43:15.636
Only person who can play dice

739
00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:17.595
like that is the devil [laughs].

740
00:43:18.596 --> 00:43:22.425
which will explain why you
riskin' your neck in this bar.

741
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:23.688
Hm.

742
00:43:24.514 --> 00:43:26.691
Nah. it's 'cause I like the
music and the company better.

743
00:43:26.865 --> 00:43:29.128
- Mm.
- If you went next door.

744
00:43:29.302 --> 00:43:31.217
you'd think they closed the
bar and opened up a morgue.

745
00:43:31.391 --> 00:43:33.915
Really?

746
00:43:34.089 --> 00:43:36.570
Well. I heard that the
owners are lookin' to sell.

747
00:43:37.702 --> 00:43:38.572
Really?

748
00:43:39.878 --> 00:43:42.794
Well. it just so happens
I'm in need of a job.

749
00:43:42.968 --> 00:43:45.753
I said they were sellin'.

750
00:43:45.927 --> 00:43:47.363
not hirin' [chuckles].

751
00:43:49.844 --> 00:43:50.671
They here now?

752
00:44:00.028 --> 00:44:01.247
Jim Perkins?

753
00:44:01.421 --> 00:44:02.291
Yeah.

754
00:44:03.858 --> 00:44:04.903
Phil Robertson.

755
00:44:05.077 --> 00:44:06.731
Nice to meet you.

756
00:44:06.905 --> 00:44:07.819
I heard y'all might be interested

757
00:44:07.993 --> 00:44:09.342
in doin' a little business.

758
00:44:10.735 --> 00:44:12.214
What. you wanna buy the bar?

759
00:44:13.085 --> 00:44:14.303
Well. thought we could talk about

760
00:44:14.477 --> 00:44:16.566
a bit more of a creative strategy.

761
00:44:19.526 --> 00:44:20.396
Hold on.

762
00:44:21.441 --> 00:44:22.747
Hold on.
- Phil!

763
00:44:27.099 --> 00:44:28.013
Keep 'em closed.

764
00:44:30.189 --> 00:44:31.320
Come on.

765
00:44:31.494 --> 00:44:32.757
- Can I open them?
- Not yet.

766
00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.457
Just a little further. little further.

767
00:44:40.590 --> 00:44:41.896
Keep 'em closed.

768
00:44:45.073 --> 00:44:46.118
Stand here.

769
00:44:46.292 --> 00:44:48.120
Don't open 'em till I tell ya.

770
00:44:48.294 --> 00:44:49.687
Why does it smell like urine?

771
00:44:54.996 --> 00:44:55.997
Hold on.

772
00:44:58.826 --> 00:44:59.479
Phil?

773
00:45:01.655 --> 00:45:03.309
Okay. open 'em.

774
00:45:09.489 --> 00:45:12.884
It's a bar.

775
00:45:13.058 --> 00:45:15.974
♪ I don't need ♪

776
00:45:16.148 --> 00:45:17.018
You bought a bar?

777
00:45:17.192 --> 00:45:18.585
♪ silver and gold ♪

778
00:45:18.759 --> 00:45:19.717
Sort of.

779
00:45:19.891 --> 00:45:22.894
Phil. we can't afford a bar.

780
00:45:23.068 --> 00:45:24.852
♪ I don't need ♪

781
00:45:25.026 --> 00:45:27.594
I can't even afford groceries.

782
00:45:27.768 --> 00:45:29.030
Don't worry about that.

783
00:45:30.162 --> 00:45:30.989
Look at this.

784
00:45:34.079 --> 00:45:37.082
This is a new start for us as a family.

785
00:45:37.256 --> 00:45:38.213
You been complainin' about money.

786
00:45:38.387 --> 00:45:40.650
we'll make some more money here.

787
00:45:40.825 --> 00:45:43.697
You been complainin' about
not spendin' time together.

788
00:45:43.871 --> 00:45:46.482
well. we'll all be here as a family.

789
00:45:49.094 --> 00:45:50.008
I don't know. Phil.

790
00:45:50.182 --> 00:45:51.009
Hey.

791
00:45:52.227 --> 00:45:53.402
I'll make it up to you.

792
00:45:55.883 --> 00:45:58.668
Kay. I'm gonna make it up to you.

793
00:46:00.583 --> 00:46:03.630
I know things didn't work
out with the teachin' job.

794
00:46:03.804 --> 00:46:05.284
and I was tired.

795
00:46:05.458 --> 00:46:07.808
I wasn't treatin' this family well.

796
00:46:10.637 --> 00:46:14.510
But this is a fresh start for
the Robertson family. okay?

797
00:46:15.729 --> 00:46:17.426
Alan and Jase. they can even help.

798
00:46:23.345 --> 00:46:26.609
Look. I know you're a good man.

799
00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:28.046
I fell in love with that.

800
00:46:32.267 --> 00:46:34.095
But it's the drinkin'.

801
00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:38.317
How's bein' in a bar gonna help with that?

802
00:46:39.535 --> 00:46:42.800
'Cause I'll be workin'. not drinkin'.

803
00:46:43.713 --> 00:46:47.717
Look. you'll keep an eye
on it. I'll keep on it.

804
00:46:50.459 --> 00:46:52.635
I'm gon' make this
work. I want it to work.

805
00:46:56.465 --> 00:46:59.817
You know you're the only one for me.

806
00:46:59.991 --> 00:47:02.645
♪ Darlin' all I need is you ♪

807
00:47:11.524 --> 00:47:12.481
I love you.

808
00:47:18.313 --> 00:47:23.318
I love you.

809
00:47:23.492 --> 00:47:26.104
First thing we gotta do

810
00:47:26.278 --> 00:47:27.714
is get that pee smell outta here though.

811
00:47:27.888 --> 00:47:29.585
'cause that is horrible.

812
00:47:32.153 --> 00:47:33.285
I agree.

813
00:47:33.459 --> 00:47:35.243
I thought I had it figured out [chuckles].

814
00:47:36.505 --> 00:47:38.203
Finally I had arrived.

815
00:47:38.377 --> 00:47:39.944
A way to spend time with my family.

816
00:47:40.118 --> 00:47:42.511
makin' more money. and still get to hang

817
00:47:42.685 --> 00:47:45.297
with my buddies and run
with them all night long.

818
00:47:45.471 --> 00:47:48.213
Daddy. when have I dried enough glasses?

819
00:47:48.387 --> 00:47:49.562
That's the point.

820
00:47:49.736 --> 00:47:51.564
They drink 'em. we clean 'em.

821
00:47:51.738 --> 00:47:54.959
and the whole cycle starts all
over again till closin' time.

822
00:47:55.133 --> 00:47:56.438
You're doin' great. keep goin'.

823
00:47:56.612 --> 00:47:59.267
Hey. get some more peanuts in here.

824
00:48:00.225 --> 00:48:01.139
Okay.

825
00:48:01.313 --> 00:48:02.880
Hey. Phil. get over here.

826
00:48:03.054 --> 00:48:05.534
I got a couple of friends I would like

827
00:48:05.708 --> 00:48:07.362
to introduce you to.

828
00:48:10.626 --> 00:48:14.500
Miss Kay. I'm dyin' here.

829
00:48:14.674 --> 00:48:16.023
Hold on. Billy.

830
00:48:16.197 --> 00:48:17.590
Don't think I don't see you there actin'

831
00:48:17.764 --> 00:48:18.896
like you haven't already
drank the Mississippi

832
00:48:19.070 --> 00:48:20.854
and spent your paycheck tonight.

833
00:48:27.165 --> 00:48:29.254
Why don't you
scoot on over a little bit.

834
00:48:30.951 --> 00:48:32.170
I'm tired of your disrespect!

835
00:48:32.344 --> 00:48:33.823
What is disrespectful about askin' you

836
00:48:33.998 --> 00:48:35.869
to spend one day with your family?

837
00:48:36.043 --> 00:48:37.088
That's all you do!

838
00:48:37.262 --> 00:48:39.917
Nag. nag. nag. nag. nag!

839
00:48:40.091 --> 00:48:41.744
The boys wanna see their daddy!

840
00:48:41.919 --> 00:48:44.182
Oh. don't use your boys to guilt me!

841
00:48:46.662 --> 00:48:49.361
Don't act like I don't
know what you've been up to.

842
00:48:49.535 --> 00:48:51.493
You been out drinkin'
that moonshine again.

843
00:48:51.667 --> 00:48:52.799
I can see it in your eyes.

844
00:48:52.973 --> 00:48:54.670
What the hell does that matter to you?

845
00:48:54.844 --> 00:48:57.064
'Cause it makes you
act like a wild animal.

846
00:48:57.238 --> 00:48:58.413
Oh. you wanna see a wild animal?

847
00:48:58.587 --> 00:48:59.719
Here you go!

848
00:49:29.009 --> 00:49:33.144
Uncle Si!

849
00:49:36.712 --> 00:49:37.539
Come here. boys!

850
00:49:37.713 --> 00:49:40.499
What about it [laughs]?

851
00:49:40.673 --> 00:49:41.804
Oh. man.

852
00:49:42.675 --> 00:49:44.459
Oh. look at you.

853
00:49:44.633 --> 00:49:46.635
Man. y'all growin' faster than
green grass through a goose.

854
00:49:46.809 --> 00:49:47.985
We missed you. Uncle Si.

855
00:49:48.159 --> 00:49:49.421
Oh. buddy. I missed you. too.

856
00:49:49.595 --> 00:49:51.118
I missed you. too.

857
00:49:51.292 --> 00:49:52.250
Where's your mama?

858
00:49:52.424 --> 00:49:53.729
- Inside.
- Miss Kay!

859
00:49:58.038 --> 00:49:59.126
You can't catch me. Jase.

860
00:50:01.128 --> 00:50:03.870
- Get him. Alan!
- Tag. you're it.

861
00:50:07.047 --> 00:50:09.789
- Tag.
- Oh. I got you back.

862
00:50:09.963 --> 00:50:11.312
He becomes the devil. Si.

863
00:50:12.487 --> 00:50:14.489
Mm hm.

864
00:50:14.663 --> 00:50:16.230
I've seen it in his eyes.

865
00:50:19.233 --> 00:50:20.582
But it ain't him.

866
00:50:22.193 --> 00:50:24.891
You know that ain't your brother.

867
00:50:27.024 --> 00:50:29.852
Yeah. well. maybe not.
but I mean. come on.

868
00:50:30.027 --> 00:50:31.289
you don't deserve this.

869
00:50:33.030 --> 00:50:34.901
You're raisin' three boys on your own.

870
00:50:38.731 --> 00:50:41.212
I don't know what I deserve.

871
00:50:44.606 --> 00:50:48.175
Besides. what would
leavin' do to the boys?

872
00:50:49.611 --> 00:50:50.786
They love their daddy.

873
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.484
Go long. Jase!

874
00:50:52.658 --> 00:50:53.528
Okay.

875
00:50:55.574 --> 00:50:58.011
I know it sounds crazy. Si.

876
00:51:00.274 --> 00:51:02.798
but I just know deep in my heart

877
00:51:06.150 --> 00:51:07.673
this family is gon' work out.

878
00:51:19.206 --> 00:51:20.077
Well.

879
00:51:22.122 --> 00:51:23.167
you know he ain't gonna change.

880
00:51:23.341 --> 00:51:24.820
not unless he stops drinkin'.

881
00:51:26.953 --> 00:51:27.823
I know.

882
00:51:32.654 --> 00:51:37.268
But you know. my Nanny
told me that someday

883
00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:40.749
you gonna have to fight for your marriage.

884
00:51:44.144 --> 00:51:47.234
When things get tough. that's what you do.

885
00:51:51.412 --> 00:51:52.152
You fight.

886
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:05.687
Excuse me. ladies. gimme one second.

887
00:52:09.735 --> 00:52:10.562
Hey. Phil?

888
00:52:14.392 --> 00:52:15.828
There's someone here to see you.

889
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:27.622
Who's responsible for this?

890
00:52:27.796 --> 00:52:30.103
Do you know where you'd
go if you die tonight?

891
00:52:31.104 --> 00:52:31.800
Jan?

892
00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:34.716

00:52:59.393 --> 00:53:01.395
Just God and the good news.

902
00:53:03.919 --> 00:53:05.747
Don't you read "Times Magazine?"

903
00:53:06.879 --> 00:53:07.923
God is dead.

904
00:53:10.535 --> 00:53:12.450
Yeah. that's not been my experience.

905
00:53:13.755 --> 00:53:17.324
But I have been in here less than maybe

906
00:53:17.498 --> 00:53:20.936
a minute or two and I can already see

907
00:53:21.110 --> 00:53:23.417
you got one mighty chip on your shoulder.

908
00:53:30.076 --> 00:53:31.860
I should knock you out right here.

909
00:53:32.905 --> 00:53:34.167
You can try.

910
00:53:34.341 --> 00:53:35.212
Oh.

911
00:53:37.126 --> 00:53:38.345
Tall words from a preacher man

912
00:53:38.519 --> 00:53:41.043
who can't do nothin' about it.

913
00:53:42.306 --> 00:53:44.046
Jesus says I got to forgive you.

914
00:53:46.788 --> 00:53:50.357
but that don't mean he
won't forgive me. too.

915
00:53:50.531 --> 00:53:51.358
Phil.

916
00:53:53.186 --> 00:53:56.320
Jan. why you bringin' a
preacher man around here?

917
00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:01.412
Well. I heard you might be needin' one.

918
00:54:04.153 --> 00:54:05.981
Preachers ain't welcome 'round here.

919
00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:08.897
Let's go. Jan.

920
00:54:10.682 --> 00:54:12.161
He ain't ready yet.

921
00:54:12.336 --> 00:54:13.467
How you doin'. Ma'am?

922
00:54:13.641 --> 00:54:14.599
Excuse me.
- Jan. you should stay.

923
00:54:14.773 --> 00:54:16.165
Have a drink.

924
00:54:16.340 --> 00:54:17.906
I'm gonna be prayin' for you.

925
00:54:20.779 --> 00:54:22.563
Then you'll be wastin' your time.

926
00:54:24.130 --> 00:54:26.175
All right then.

927
00:54:26.350 --> 00:54:28.047
All right. God bless yourself.

928
00:54:35.837 --> 00:54:36.925
You put her up to it.

929
00:54:37.099 --> 00:54:38.579
I didn't.

930
00:54:38.753 --> 00:54:40.277
I swear. I didn't know
she was comin' around.

931
00:54:40.451 --> 00:54:41.930
Don't lie to me.

932
00:54:42.104 --> 00:54:43.932
I saw the way she was lookin' at you.

933
00:54:46.674 --> 00:54:48.807
This is just you tryin' to control me.

934
00:54:48.981 --> 00:54:49.721
All of you.

935
00:54:49.895 --> 00:54:52.289
Phil. please. please.

936
00:54:52.463 --> 00:54:54.900
I swear to God. you better
hold that tongue of yours.

937
00:54:55.074 --> 00:54:56.771
Phil. you're hurtin' my arm.

938
00:54:56.945 --> 00:54:58.773
If I found out you been tellin'
people about our business-

939
00:54:58.947 --> 00:55:00.732
Phil. you're hurtin' me.

940
00:55:18.402 --> 00:55:19.794
What'll it be. boys?

941
00:55:19.968 --> 00:55:21.361
Hm?

942
00:55:21.535 --> 00:55:23.668
Hey. sweetheart. that
pie recipe she gave me.

943
00:55:23.842 --> 00:55:25.626
my boys. they go crazy for it [chuckles].

944
00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:26.801
They do [chuckles].

945
00:55:28.107 --> 00:55:29.064
Where you been?

946
00:55:29.238 --> 00:55:31.023
Pretty late for grocery shoppin'.

947
00:55:31.197 --> 00:55:33.155
Well. when am I supposed to go?

948
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:34.983
Been at the bar all day. Phil.

949
00:55:35.157 --> 00:55:36.811
You were with him. weren't ya?

950
00:55:36.985 --> 00:55:38.900
What are you talkin' about?

951
00:55:39.074 --> 00:55:39.814
That guy from the bar.

952
00:55:43.252 --> 00:55:44.515
Phil. I'm tired.

953
00:55:44.689 --> 00:55:46.865
It's been a long day and you been drinkin'

954
00:55:47.039 --> 00:55:48.867
through most of it.

955
00:55:49.041 --> 00:55:51.870
My drinkin' ain't got
nothin' to do with it.

956
00:55:52.044 --> 00:55:54.481
How long you been
runnin' 'round on me. hm?

957
00:55:54.655 --> 00:55:56.831
Answer the damn question.

958
00:55:58.050 --> 00:56:00.400
I ain't runnin' around on you.

959
00:56:01.358 --> 00:56:02.794
I know you're lyin'.

960
00:56:04.578 --> 00:56:06.711
Phil. I ain't havin'
this conversation now.

961
00:56:06.885 --> 00:56:08.103
Not when you're drunk.

962
00:56:08.277 --> 00:56:09.366
I ain't the problem.

963
00:56:10.323 --> 00:56:11.542
You're the problem.

964
00:56:11.716 --> 00:56:13.326
You're ruinin' my life!

965
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:14.936
Oh. yeah?

966
00:56:15.110 --> 00:56:18.287
Well. you been ruinin' mine for 10 years!

967
00:56:21.595 --> 00:56:22.422
Get out.

968
00:56:24.729 --> 00:56:26.513
Get out and take your kids with you.

969
00:57:02.854 --> 00:57:03.985
Good Lord. Phil.

970
00:57:06.248 --> 00:57:07.685
I can't hardly believe that.

971
00:57:12.864 --> 00:57:16.084
I can't believe the thought
of what I did most days.

972
00:57:20.785 --> 00:57:23.004
But that was a point
where I'd lost it all.

973
00:57:25.703 --> 00:57:26.530
Kay.

974
00:57:29.097 --> 00:57:29.924
the boys.

975
00:57:31.578 --> 00:57:32.449
the bar.

976
00:57:34.276 --> 00:57:35.147
Bingo.

977
00:57:36.801 --> 00:57:38.063
Just like that.

978
00:58:07.788 --> 00:58:09.703
Kay. what's happenin'?

979
00:58:09.877 --> 00:58:11.052
What's goin' on? Come in.

980
00:58:11.226 --> 00:58:12.401
Come on in.

981
00:58:28.809 --> 00:58:29.636
Thanks.

982
00:58:34.859 --> 00:58:36.600
You can stay as long as you want.

983
00:58:40.125 --> 00:58:41.996
I can't trouble you like that.

984
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:44.869
Trust me. it's no trouble at all.

985
00:58:46.914 --> 00:58:49.047
You're not worried
about Phil findin' out?

986
00:58:51.310 --> 00:58:52.398
He kicked you out.

987
00:58:58.186 --> 00:59:00.667
Why don't you go freshen up?

988
00:59:00.841 --> 00:59:02.016
I'll listen for Willie.

989
00:59:10.242 --> 00:59:11.112
Thank you. Jan.

990
00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:13.201
Of course.

991
01:01:09.578 --> 01:01:11.363
Are you okay. Mama?

992
01:01:14.540 --> 01:01:15.933
Mama?

993
01:01:16.107 --> 01:01:16.934
Hey.

994
01:01:18.283 --> 01:01:19.588
What's goin' on?

995
01:01:19.763 --> 01:01:21.199
It's Mama.

996
01:01:24.942 --> 01:01:27.640
Okay. okay. just go
back to bed. all right?

997
01:01:27.814 --> 01:01:28.467
Back to bed.

998
01:01:28.641 --> 01:01:29.511
I'll check.

999
01:01:34.212 --> 01:01:35.474
Kay?

1000
01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:45.310
Kay. are you all right?

1001
01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:26.481
I was thinkin' about
somethin' real stupid.

1002
01:02:34.794 --> 01:02:36.578
I was about to do it.

1003
01:02:39.712 --> 01:02:44.717
I just kept thinkin' about
those boys [sobs softly].

1004
01:02:50.462 --> 01:02:51.724
I'm their mama.

1005
01:02:53.944 --> 01:02:56.990
I can't just leave 'em alone.

1006
01:02:57.164 --> 01:02:58.513
No. you can't.

1007
01:03:05.259 --> 01:03:09.481
I really believed it was
gon' work out with Phil.

1008
01:03:11.439 --> 01:03:12.527
I really did.

1009
01:03:18.098 --> 01:03:22.189
But it's over [inhales shakily].

1010
01:03:25.192 --> 01:03:27.629
I just don't know what to do.

1011
01:03:34.375 --> 01:03:35.246
Well.

1012
01:03:39.903 --> 01:03:42.775
you can start by gettin'
up off the bathroom floor.

1013
01:03:49.216 --> 01:03:54.178
When I was little. and
Mama was in the hospital.

1014
01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:58.008
and Daddy was on the oil rigs.

1015
01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:03.056
I used to cry myself to sleep every night.

1016
01:04:06.146 --> 01:04:06.973
And then

1017
01:04:08.627 --> 01:04:10.585
one Sunday.

1018
01:04:10.759 --> 01:04:14.981
I heard the preacher down at church sayin'

1019
01:04:15.155 --> 01:04:16.983
that at some point in our lives.

1020
01:04:18.593 --> 01:04:23.381
we are all going to
feel desperately alone.

1021
01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:30.823
like we're the only soul
in the whole entire world.

1022
01:04:30.997 --> 01:04:34.653
and that that would be
the most important moment

1023
01:04:34.827 --> 01:04:36.481
in our whole entire lives

1024
01:04:38.091 --> 01:04:42.530
because when we realize that with Jesus.

1025
01:04:44.315 --> 01:04:46.056
we ain't never alone.

1026
01:04:49.233 --> 01:04:50.060
So.

1027
01:04:52.366 --> 01:04:55.021
I stopped cryin' myself to sleep at night.

1028
01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:59.373
and I started prayin' instead.

1029
01:05:02.159 --> 01:05:04.596
I'll watch the boys tomorrow.

1030
01:05:05.989 --> 01:05:07.729
There's someone you gotta go see.

1031
01:05:23.397 --> 01:05:25.269
Hey. that was a good one.

1032
01:05:25.443 --> 01:05:26.531
I appreciate ya.

1033
01:05:26.705 --> 01:05:29.751
God bless ya. I'll see ya on Wednesday.

1034
01:05:39.326 --> 01:05:40.632
Pastor Smith?

1035
01:05:40.806 --> 01:05:42.155
Yeah?

1036
01:05:42.329 --> 01:05:43.156
Hi.

1037
01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:44.984
I'm Kay Robertson.

1038
01:05:46.464 --> 01:05:47.856
Right.

1039
01:05:48.031 --> 01:05:49.771
Jan told me you might stop by.

1040
01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:51.382
It's good to see you again. Miss Kay.

1041
01:05:51.556 --> 01:05:52.600
It's been a bit.

1042
01:05:53.558 --> 01:05:56.865
I'm really sorry about my husband.

1043
01:05:58.867 --> 01:06:01.870
The first time at the bar-

1044
01:06:02.045 --> 01:06:03.002
Would it surprise you if I told you

1045
01:06:03.176 --> 01:06:04.699
I get that reaction a lot?

1046
01:06:07.441 --> 01:06:08.268
I guess not.

1047
01:06:09.443 --> 01:06:10.488
How's your husband?

1048
01:06:17.103 --> 01:06:19.105
He kicked us outta the house yesterday.

1049
01:06:20.759 --> 01:06:21.890
Me and my three boys.

1050
01:06:26.112 --> 01:06:27.505
Sorry to hear that.

1051
01:06:30.638 --> 01:06:32.597
Look. Jan said to come talk to you.

1052
01:06:34.599 --> 01:06:36.557
maybe you might be able to help us out.

1053
01:06:38.429 --> 01:06:42.389
But I don't really know
what I'm doin' here.

1054
01:06:43.825 --> 01:06:46.045
or what even to say and...

1055
01:06:52.834 --> 01:06:57.361
I guess I got into some
trouble last night.

1056
01:06:59.493 --> 01:07:00.538
thinkin' about some things

1057
01:07:00.712 --> 01:07:02.322
I shouldn't have been thinkin' about.

1058
01:07:04.933 --> 01:07:05.804
And...

1059
01:07:07.284 --> 01:07:08.676
I'm really sorry.

1060
01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:10.504
You must be so busy.

1061
01:07:10.678 --> 01:07:11.897
It's not a problem.

1062
01:07:13.942 --> 01:07:14.813
Truly.

1063
01:07:18.338 --> 01:07:19.513
You know. Miss Kay. it's the strangest

1064
01:07:19.687 --> 01:07:20.732
thing you should come by.

1065
01:07:20.906 --> 01:07:23.735
I was just now right now in a meetin'

1066
01:07:23.909 --> 01:07:25.476
and we was talkin' about what

1067
01:07:25.650 --> 01:07:26.868
to do with one of our little places

1068
01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:28.348
that just became vacant.

1069
01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:32.570
In fact. it's right over there.

1070
01:07:33.397 --> 01:07:34.876
It's right across the street.

1071
01:07:35.834 --> 01:07:36.965
Now. does that sound like somethin'

1072
01:07:37.140 --> 01:07:39.055
you and your boys might be interested in?

1073
01:07:44.930 --> 01:07:47.628
I don't know what to say. Pastor Smith.

1074
01:07:47.802 --> 01:07:49.717
Just Bill is fine.

1075
01:07:52.198 --> 01:07:54.722
Or Pastor Bill if you wanna be formal. hm?

1076
01:07:57.682 --> 01:07:58.378
Come on.

1077
01:08:06.908 --> 01:08:08.736
So we live here now?

1078
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:10.521
Yeah.

1079
01:08:12.044 --> 01:08:13.350
This is a gift.

1080
01:08:14.481 --> 01:08:16.222
We're gonna take real
good care of it. you hear?

1081
01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:29.627
Kay got a job
and took care of the boys.

1082
01:08:29.801 --> 01:08:31.019
She was determined to make somethin'

1083
01:08:31.194 --> 01:08:32.543
of a life for them.

1084
01:08:35.067 --> 01:08:38.288
As for me. I finally had my freedom.

1085
01:08:39.593 --> 01:08:42.205
but it certainly didn't feel
like I thought it would.

1086
01:08:44.642 --> 01:08:45.512
Phil!

1087
01:08:48.863 --> 01:08:50.430
Phil. you in there?

1088
01:08:55.522 --> 01:08:57.133
As I live and breathe.

1089
01:08:58.046 --> 01:09:00.484
Man. I got a call from Nancy
down at the sheriff's station.

1090
01:09:00.658 --> 01:09:02.094
They found your truck completely totaled

1091
01:09:02.268 --> 01:09:03.704
but couldn't find your body.

1092
01:09:06.054 --> 01:09:07.621
I done a lotta crazy things in my life

1093
01:09:07.795 --> 01:09:09.188
but I ain't never done smashed

1094
01:09:09.362 --> 01:09:10.929
my truck up good enough to be canned

1095
01:09:11.103 --> 01:09:12.409
and put on the shelf in it.

1096
01:09:15.455 --> 01:09:16.848
Who's a man?

1097
01:09:20.373 --> 01:09:21.592
Hell. I'd offer to help you clean up.

1098
01:09:21.766 --> 01:09:24.377
but this is a lost cause.

1099
01:09:27.424 --> 01:09:28.729
This a gar hole. son.

1100
01:09:32.559 --> 01:09:33.430
What's the day?

1101
01:09:34.996 --> 01:09:36.650

Mama. can we take those?

1111
01:10:10.989 --> 01:10:11.990
No. Alan.

1112
01:10:12.164 --> 01:10:13.034
Those are for kids that don't get

1113
01:10:13.209 --> 01:10:14.819
no presents at Christmas.

1114
01:10:17.778 --> 01:10:18.605
Okay.

1115
01:10:19.911 --> 01:10:20.912
But just a few.

1116
01:10:21.086 --> 01:10:22.435
Leave some for the other kids.

1117
01:10:55.425 --> 01:10:56.513
Get outta here!

1118
01:10:56.687 --> 01:10:57.514
Go!

1119
01:11:00.995 --> 01:11:04.085
She can't help it. it's
in her blood or somethin'.

1120
01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:06.479
We got that blood in us?

1121
01:11:06.653 --> 01:11:08.002
Don't know. but we'll always

1122
01:11:08.176 --> 01:11:11.005
look out for each other won't we?

1123
01:11:11.179 --> 01:11:13.312
You mean that. Phil?

1124
01:11:13.486 --> 01:11:15.096
Of course I do. Jan.

1125
01:11:28.545 --> 01:11:29.763
- Are we there yet?
- Are we there yet?

1126
01:11:29.937 --> 01:11:31.069
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

1127
01:11:31.243 --> 01:11:33.245
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

1128
01:11:33.419 --> 01:11:35.073
Uncle Si. how much further?

1129
01:11:35.247 --> 01:11:36.466
Oh. Lord.

1130
01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:37.728
What did I say?

1131
01:11:37.902 --> 01:11:39.382
If we come. no complainin'.

1132
01:11:39.556 --> 01:11:41.253
Uh huh. what are you doin'. Alan?

1133
01:11:41.427 --> 01:11:43.124
Jase. what's he doin'?

1134
01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:44.212
Complaining.

1135
01:11:44.387 --> 01:11:46.127
That's right. uh huh.

1136
01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:52.395
Phil. it's Si. are you in there?

1137
01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:01.317
You made it back.

1138
01:12:06.974 --> 01:12:07.845

1139
01:12:10.282 --> 01:12:11.152
I did.

1140
01:12:13.067 --> 01:12:14.286
It's good to see ya.

1141
01:12:15.809 --> 01:12:17.376
Look. I knew I'd find you out here.

1142
01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:18.899
but maybe I shoulda called.

1143
01:12:19.073 --> 01:12:21.598
givin' ya time to clean
up the place a bit.

1144
01:12:23.991 --> 01:12:26.820
Ya ain't gotta live like
no wild man anymore. Phil.

1145
01:12:33.131 --> 01:12:34.959
It's better for me out here.

1146
01:12:35.133 --> 01:12:37.048
Oh. Phil. how's that?

1147
01:12:38.354 --> 01:12:39.833
I don't have to be anything but me.

1148
01:12:40.007 --> 01:12:42.401
Well. that may be true.

1149
01:12:42.575 --> 01:12:44.795
but hey. I think you should come back.

1150
01:12:44.969 --> 01:12:45.796
You know?

Work on some things.

1152
01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:53.760
And what work would I need?

1153
01:12:53.934 --> 01:12:57.416
Well. I been hearin'

1154
01:13:01.768 --> 01:13:02.769
Ain't much from fit to talk about

1155
01:13:02.943 --> 01:13:05.685

1156
01:13:05.859 --> 01:13:07.121

1157
01:13:08.949 --> 01:13:10.168

I think y'all should leave.

1167
01:13:33.409 --> 01:13:34.410
Yeah.

1168
01:13:34.584 --> 01:13:37.108

Good boy.

Dear Jesus. I miss my daddy.

Amen.

1178

01:14:17.061 --> 01:14:18.454
What do you want?

1180
01:14:19.324 --> 01:14:20.586

Thank you.

1184
01:15:13.378 --> 01:15:16.468
You're the only girl for me.

1185
01:15:17.904 --> 01:15:20.211
You gon' make a good dad.

1186
01:15:21.255 --> 01:15:22.518
I'm proud of you.

1187
01:15:23.997 --> 01:15:24.911
I love you.

1188
01:16:25.145 --> 01:16:27.191
I can't [whimpers].

1189
01:16:27.365 --> 01:16:28.235
I can't!

1190
01:16:29.889 --> 01:16:31.151
I can't!

1191
01:17:48.359 --> 01:17:50.143
You drunk right now?

1192
01:17:57.368 --> 01:17:58.761
Nope.

1193
01:18:11.034 --> 01:18:13.732
I think I saw him. Miss Kay.

1194
01:18:18.128 --> 01:18:19.433
Who?

1195
01:18:21.958 --> 01:18:23.394
The devil.

1196
01:18:32.142 --> 01:18:34.579
I think he might be me.

1197
01:18:43.588 --> 01:18:45.459
I'll quit drinkin' this time.

1198
01:18:45.633 --> 01:18:47.287
I promise.

1199
01:18:47.461 --> 01:18:48.332
No.

1200
01:18:50.987 --> 01:18:52.989
I'm done with promisin'.

1201
01:18:59.517 --> 01:19:00.387
Kay!

1202
01:19:02.259 --> 01:19:03.086
I'm sorry.

1203
01:19:04.043 --> 01:19:05.218
I messed it all up.

1204
01:19:05.392 --> 01:19:06.480
Miss Kay!

1205
01:19:10.789 --> 01:19:11.659
Phil.

1206
01:19:16.012 --> 01:19:17.187
you need help.

1207
01:19:20.712 --> 01:19:22.801
More help than me and
the boys can give ya.

1208
01:19:27.675 --> 01:19:29.286
You need to change.

1209
01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:37.729
Miss Kay.

1210
01:19:40.514 --> 01:19:42.386
I'll do anything for you and the boys.

1211
01:19:46.825 --> 01:19:47.695
Anything.

1212
01:19:50.829 --> 01:19:51.699
I swear.

1213
01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:11.110
Gimme a minute.

1214
01:20:11.284 --> 01:20:13.156
It's really okay. Phil.

1215
01:20:18.161 --> 01:20:18.988
Uh...

1216
01:20:22.208 --> 01:20:23.209
You know.

1217
01:20:25.168 --> 01:20:26.996
it's beautiful out back.

1218
01:20:27.170 --> 01:20:28.084
You wanna?

1219
01:20:28.258 --> 01:20:28.998
How 'bout you meet me out there?

1220
01:21:06.949 --> 01:21:07.601
Nah.

1221
01:21:09.690 --> 01:21:11.954
Not quite sure what to say.

1222
01:21:13.303 --> 01:21:15.653
Just say whatever's
on your mind. Phil.

1223
01:21:29.754 --> 01:21:31.190
I guess it were...

1224
01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:38.545
Everything I ever touch is goin' to hell.

1225
01:21:41.505 --> 01:21:44.900
You know what I would do if everything

1226
01:21:45.074 --> 01:21:46.771
I touched went to hell?

1227
01:21:50.427 --> 01:21:51.254
What's that?

1228
01:22:06.356 --> 01:22:08.575
I'd quit touchin' things.

1229
01:22:16.888 --> 01:22:20.065
Do you know what most
stories have in common?

1230
01:22:23.808 --> 01:22:26.985
Most of 'em are about

1231
01:22:29.509 --> 01:22:31.555
climbin' the mountain.

1232
01:22:32.425 --> 01:22:34.732
becomin' a God.

1233
01:22:37.082 --> 01:22:39.302
provin' just how good you are.

1234
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:42.305
that you're good enough.

1235
01:22:49.486 --> 01:22:50.966
It's a whole different story.

1236
01:22:56.797 --> 01:23:00.584
This is about God comin'
down from the mountain.

1237
01:23:02.716 --> 01:23:07.286
comin' to you. tellin' you.

1238
01:23:08.722 --> 01:23:12.204
"Phil. you ain't got nothin' to prove."

1239
01:23:18.776 --> 01:23:20.647
Hey. that chip on your shoulder.

1240
01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:25.087
shame you've had your whole life.

1241
01:23:28.264 --> 01:23:30.440
It don't mean nothin' to Him.

1242
01:23:31.702 --> 01:23:33.138
In fact.

1243
01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:39.927
He come down to take that away.

1244
01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:51.852
That sounds too good to be true.

1245
01:23:53.463 --> 01:23:54.290
Oh.

1246
01:23:57.119 --> 01:23:59.469
it's too good for all of us.

1247
01:24:03.386 --> 01:24:04.909
How's it happen?

1248
01:24:06.389 --> 01:24:08.304
You got to die. Phil.

1249
01:24:14.136 --> 01:24:16.834
And then you need to be born again.

1250
01:24:30.587 --> 01:24:31.805
I'm ready.

1251
01:24:44.253 --> 01:24:46.168
Your daddy's lived a hard life.

1252
01:24:49.432 --> 01:24:50.389
That ends today.

1253
01:24:53.218 --> 01:24:54.828
We gon' bury that old man.

1254
01:24:59.311 --> 01:25:01.400
This dirty river water represents a grave.

1255
01:25:02.619 --> 01:25:07.537
But. a new man is gonna rise up.

1256
01:25:09.147 --> 01:25:11.932
Phil. from this day forth.

1257
01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:14.544
who's gonna be the lord in your life?

1258
01:25:14.718 --> 01:25:16.023
Jesus Christ.

1259
01:25:17.634 --> 01:25:19.418
With that confession.

1260
01:25:19.592 --> 01:25:21.464
I baptize you in the
name of the Father. Son.

1261
01:25:21.638 --> 01:25:24.989
and Holy Ghost for the
forgiveness of your sins.

1262

Thanks. buddy.

You gonna buy Jase a
new one now you broke it?

1285
01:28:06.455 --> 01:28:08.935
I didn't break it. just fixin' it.

1286
01:28:15.681 --> 01:28:18.293
You know. I had a moment today.

1287
01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:23.254
Maybe bein' sober for the
first time in a long time.

1288
01:28:26.388 --> 01:28:28.215
Lots of people make duck calls. right?

1289
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:30.305
They sound like ducks. sure.

1290
01:28:30.479 --> 01:28:32.524
but pintails sure don't
sound like a mallard.

1291
01:28:32.698 --> 01:28:37.094
just as much as I don't
sound like you when I talk.

1292
01:28:37.268 --> 01:28:37.921
So what?

1293
01:28:38.095 --> 01:28:39.139
"So what?"

1294
01:28:49.019 --> 01:28:50.499
Thanks for bein' here today.

1295
01:28:52.979 --> 01:28:54.154
Meant a lot to the boys.

1296
01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:02.337
I've been tryin'.

1297
01:29:06.906 --> 01:29:08.299
You been tryin'.

1298
01:29:11.911 --> 01:29:14.479
I know it ain't been perfect.

1299
01:29:16.655 --> 01:29:17.482
No.

1300
01:29:19.963 --> 01:29:24.010
Truth is. I been fightin'
for us for 10 years.

1301
01:29:27.144 --> 01:29:28.624
I just had nothin' left in me.

1302
01:29:32.410 --> 01:29:34.978
Then I saw you get baptized in that river

1303
01:29:35.152 --> 01:29:36.719
and I was

1304
01:29:37.981 --> 01:29:39.374
I was full.

1305
01:29:40.462 --> 01:29:41.985
I was so full of joy.

1306
01:29:47.904 --> 01:29:49.296
My heart was so full.

1307
01:29:52.865 --> 01:29:55.215
and I had this little voice.

1308
01:29:58.523 --> 01:30:01.308
This naggin' voice sayin'

1309
01:30:01.483 --> 01:30:04.007
it's just gonna start all over again.

1310
01:30:05.878 --> 01:30:07.619
And you was gonna break our hearts.

1311
01:30:10.230 --> 01:30:11.754
I'm sorry. Miss Kay.

1312
01:30:13.930 --> 01:30:14.757
Truly.

1313
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:20.502
I never wanna put you through that again.

1314
01:30:26.464 --> 01:30:28.814
You remember why you quit football?

1315
01:30:32.688 --> 01:30:34.341
It was huntin' season.

1316
01:30:36.126 --> 01:30:37.693
Well. partly 'cause you are stubborn

1317
01:30:37.867 --> 01:30:39.346
as an ox stuck in mud.

1318
01:30:43.525 --> 01:30:46.789
But the other part. that
was 'cause you wanted

1319
01:30:46.963 --> 01:30:48.791
to take care of us.

1320
01:30:50.619 --> 01:30:54.492
Take care of your family
just like you always had.

1321
01:30:56.581 --> 01:30:59.018
Now look. I know you're gonna stumble.

1322
01:30:59.192 --> 01:31:01.847
I know it ain't gon' be perfect.

1323
01:31:04.676 --> 01:31:07.026
But maybe if you just keep that in mind.

1324
01:31:09.899 --> 01:31:13.250
how much you really do love your family.

1325
01:31:14.294 --> 01:31:15.165
Yeah.

1326
01:31:16.079 --> 01:31:20.083
Maybe it might be right
to get away from it all.

1327
01:31:21.084 --> 01:31:23.086
Old friends. temptation.

1328
01:31:26.524 --> 01:31:28.483
We'll get ourselves a little place.

1329
01:31:28.657 --> 01:31:30.572
I could fish the river.

1330
01:31:32.487 --> 01:31:36.273
Well now. that might be an idea. Phil.

1331
01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:42.409
Merry Christmas.

1332
01:31:44.194 --> 01:31:45.891
Merry Christmas. Miss Kay.

1333
01:32:17.575 --> 01:32:21.492
Before I came along. everyone
thought the duck calls people

1334
01:32:21.666 --> 01:32:23.320
were makin' were great.

1335
01:32:23.494 --> 01:32:27.846
but truth is. they were missin' somethin'.

1336
01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:29.369
They looked the same.

1337
01:32:29.544 --> 01:32:30.675
You know. one duck call
looked like another.

1338
01:32:30.849 --> 01:32:35.854
but on the inside. somethin' had changed.

1339
01:32:41.773 --> 01:32:42.992
Turns out.

1340
01:32:46.038 --> 01:32:48.171
that could make all the difference.

1341
01:33:05.101 --> 01:33:05.928
Phil?

1342
01:33:06.885 --> 01:33:07.538
Phil?

1343
01:33:10.062 --> 01:33:11.716
There he is.

1344
01:33:14.414 --> 01:33:16.329
My man.

1345
01:33:16.503 --> 01:33:17.722
Keep it down.

1346
01:33:17.896 --> 01:33:19.550
Everyone's still sleepin' in there.

1347
01:33:19.724 --> 01:33:21.770
Well. they're missin'
out on the best fish. then.

1348
01:33:21.944 --> 01:33:23.598
We come to get ya. get your things.

1349
01:33:23.772 --> 01:33:25.425
It's a day after Christmas tradition.

1350
01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.905
We'll hit the water.

1351
01:33:27.079 --> 01:33:29.212
and head to State Line
Road for a party after.

1352
01:33:31.518 --> 01:33:33.172
I ain't drinkin' anymore. boys.

1353
01:33:36.132 --> 01:33:38.569
The Phil you come lookin'
for is dead and buried.

1354
01:33:43.487 --> 01:33:46.055
Dang. you startin' to scare me. Phil.

1355
01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:49.667
Look. it's been ages
since you partied with us.

1356
01:33:49.841 --> 01:33:50.842
Come on. now.

1357
01:33:51.016 --> 01:33:52.931
You know it's gon' be a grand time.

1358
01:33:53.105 --> 01:33:54.803
Get your freedom back for a night.

1359
01:33:56.195 --> 01:33:57.109
Well?

1360
01:33:57.980 --> 01:33:58.850
What's it gonna be?

1361
01:34:00.112 --> 01:34:01.113
Who's a man?

1362
01:34:49.640 --> 01:34:50.510
Daddy?

1363
01:34:50.685 --> 01:34:53.557
Shh. wake your brother.

1364
01:34:53.731 --> 01:34:55.211
Put your warm clothes on.

1365
01:34:55.385 --> 01:34:57.996
Your mama said it was okay.

1366
01:34:58.170 --> 01:34:58.823
Come on.

1367
01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:13.055
Come on. boys.

1368
01:35:17.146 --> 01:35:18.800
Stay close to Daddy.

1369
01:35:20.715 --> 01:35:21.411
Good boy.

1370
01:35:26.198 --> 01:35:30.899
Shh.

1371
01:35:32.509 --> 01:35:33.771
Look right there.

1372
01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:41.997
You try.

1373
01:35:46.175 --> 01:35:47.045
You try boy.

1374
01:35:57.926 --> 01:36:01.668
I started taking the kids
to the woods a lot more.

1375
01:36:01.843 --> 01:36:04.541
teachin' 'em about huntin'.

1376
01:36:04.715 --> 01:36:08.719
I'm just down here. fishin'. huntin'.

1377
01:36:10.068 --> 01:36:11.678
tryin' to sell these duck calls.

1378
01:36:14.725 --> 01:36:17.075
In the end I guess Kay
got her pioneer lifestyle

1379
01:36:17.249 --> 01:36:21.253
and I got my family back.

1380
01:36:24.300 --> 01:36:25.605
not because I deserved it.

1381
01:36:28.608 --> 01:36:29.784
Lord knows I didn't.

1382
01:36:33.657 --> 01:36:35.920
But that's the thing I learned about God.

1383
01:36:39.619 --> 01:36:41.143
We don't have to be good enough

1384
01:36:44.102 --> 01:36:45.669
'cause he's good enough for us.

1385
01:36:47.584 --> 01:36:49.064
I finally figured it out.

1386
01:36:51.327 --> 01:36:52.545
Just took a little time.

1387
01:37:02.425 --> 01:37:03.382
Yeah. well.

1388
01:37:06.603 --> 01:37:09.301
seems like I might not have
as much time as I thought.

1389
01:37:13.305 --> 01:37:14.654
How so?

1390
01:37:19.877 --> 01:37:22.010
Well. I ain't told
anybody else this but.

1391
01:37:25.622 --> 01:37:26.623
it's my heart.

1392
01:37:34.718 --> 01:37:36.198
I got a aneurysm.

1393
01:37:41.116 --> 01:37:45.250
Doctor said it could be two years.

1394
01:37:47.165 --> 01:37:47.862
two months.

1395
01:37:48.036 --> 01:37:48.863
Heck.

1396
01:37:51.213 --> 01:37:52.040
two days.

1397
01:37:54.999 --> 01:37:56.305
Any moment. really.

1398
01:38:04.704 --> 01:38:08.883
You called me up and
asked me to tell you

1399
01:38:10.754 --> 01:38:14.889
what I'd heard. how I got out.

1400
01:38:15.063 --> 01:38:16.368
made a life for myself.

1401
01:38:20.416 --> 01:38:24.246
Well. that's the secret. I didn't do it.

1402
01:38:27.684 --> 01:38:30.774
Only God can pull off a move like that

1403
01:38:33.124 --> 01:38:34.821
because of Jesus.

1404
01:38:36.736 --> 01:38:38.695
Stop always makin' it only about me.

1405
01:38:40.175 --> 01:38:41.132
That's what I finally learned.

1406
01:38:41.306 --> 01:38:43.482
how to give my life away.

1407
01:38:46.398 --> 01:38:47.834
Funny thing is. once I gave it up.

1408
01:38:48.009 --> 01:38:49.488
that's when I got it all back.

1409
01:38:51.099 --> 01:38:53.275
Everything I been chasin' all these years.

1410
01:38:55.625 --> 01:38:56.713
Funny how that works.

1411
01:38:59.934 --> 01:39:02.762
How you gotta come to the end of yourself

1412
01:39:04.590 --> 01:39:06.288
to find the beginning of God.

1413
01:39:12.598 --> 01:39:13.860
I gotta tell you. Phil.

1414
01:39:19.127 --> 01:39:20.780

Y'all have just witnessed

1465
01:43:34.382 --> 01:43:37.820
what happens when Satan controls a man.

1466
01:43:39.082 --> 01:43:42.651
You've seen it in living color.

1467
01:43:42.825 --> 01:43:46.263
It's embarrassing and shocking.

1468
01:43:46.437 --> 01:43:50.049
but y'all saw the initial me.

1469
01:43:50.876 --> 01:43:54.140
The acts of the sinful nature are obvious.

1470
01:43:54.315 --> 01:43:57.535
Y'all just saw the acts
of the sinful nature.

1471
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:59.189
They're obvious.

1472
01:43:59.363 --> 01:44:03.498
Jesus beat death for us. removed our sin.

1473
01:44:03.672 --> 01:44:07.893
cleans us up and guarantees
he'll raise ya from the dead.

1474
01:44:08.067 --> 01:44:11.027
I wanna remind ya of the
gospel I preach to ya.

1475
01:44:11.201 --> 01:44:14.900
which you received. I did. 50 years ago.

1476
01:44:16.380 --> 01:44:19.818
And on which you've
taken your stand. I did.

1477
01:44:20.950 --> 01:44:25.171
I'm standin' on the death barrel
and resurrection of Jesus.

1478
01:44:25.346 --> 01:44:29.915
You really can have love. joy. peace.

1479
01:44:30.916 --> 01:44:33.571
patience. kindness. goodness.

1480
01:44:33.745 --> 01:44:37.227
faithfulness. gentleness. self-control.

1481
01:44:37.401 --> 01:44:41.057
You can have those
qualities for your own life

1482
01:44:41.927 --> 01:44:45.061
if you come to Jesus through faith.

1483
01:44:45.235 --> 01:44:46.932
believe he died before he was buried

1484
01:44:47.106 --> 01:44:48.760
and raised from the dead.

1485
01:44:48.934 --> 01:44:52.155
He's seated at the right
hand of the Father right now.

1486
01:44:52.329 --> 01:44:54.244
It's a wonderful thing.

1487
01:44:54.418 --> 01:44:59.380
and I highly recommend you
just start walking by faith.

1488
01:45:01.860 --> 01:45:05.473
My question is. you got a better story?

1489
01:45:05.647 --> 01:45:07.083
I'd love to hear it.

1490
01:45:07.257 --> 01:45:11.392
We could be wrong. but I doubt it.

1491
01:45:33.022 --> 01:45:34.415
A lotta people said.

1492
01:45:34.589 --> 01:45:38.332
"If you played ahead of Bradshaw at Tech.

1493
01:45:39.594 --> 01:45:41.378
and he went on to win four Superbowls."

1494
01:45:41.552 --> 01:45:44.729
they said. "Man. what in
the world happened to you?"

1495
01:45:47.819 --> 01:45:51.388
I really don't know what
to tell 'em except Bradshaw

1496
01:45:51.562 --> 01:45:54.260
went after the books and
I went after the ducks.

1497
01:45:55.261 --> 01:45:57.699
And I think we're both pretty happy. so.
