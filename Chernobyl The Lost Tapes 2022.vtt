We have agreed to a joint Soviet

Until the accident there were 50

Most of the larger Soviet plants
differ in design to US reactors.

99
00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:37.960
the major difference is most Soviet
nuclear plants do not have

around the reactor as is
the general-

109
00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:00.080
Can we be sure of that? What do you-
I do not. I do not know.

110
00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:02.000
Do you think there's
a containment building?

111
00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:04.560
I don't think that there is a
containment building because

112
00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:09.600
the policy of Soviet atomic er.
constructors was that

113
00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:10.000
the reactor's absolutely safe and so
there is no need to have

114
00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.720
the reactor's absolutely safe and so
there is no need to have

115
00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:17.080
this kind of precaution because it
indicate possibility of disaster

116
00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:18.000
which Russian always can. considered

117

118
00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:24.760
So going to be clear about this.
you're. you're going as far

119
00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.000
as to say you think it almost
certain or just probable

120
00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.440
as to say you think it almost
certain or just probable

121
00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:30.960
there was no protective shield
around this reactor

122
00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.640
which appears to have melted down?

123
00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.000
No I think that there is no
protection. protection shield

124
00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.520
No I think that there is no
protection. protection shield

125
00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:39.280
around this reactor's certainly
the case because the building

126
00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.160
as such indicate
that there is no shield.

133
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.800
What has been remarkable is how much
the Soviet people

134
00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:32.840
in spite of all the evidence
still seem to be believing

135
