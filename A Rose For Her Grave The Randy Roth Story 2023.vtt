00:00:04.656 --> 00:00:09.270
- I have this dream.
I lie in sombre.

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.272
Water surrounds me.

5
00:00:13.404 --> 00:00:16.494
I breathe no longer.

6
00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:20.542
Death approaches.
extending its hand.

7
00:00:20.672 --> 00:00:25.503
Now a friend I did not plan.

8
00:00:25.634 --> 00:00:29.507
But in this dream. I never wake.

9
00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:32.554
Tragedy now becomes my fate.

10
00:01:31.395 --> 00:01:32.918
Thank you.

11
00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:42.102
- I'm so sorry.

12
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.024
You want me to kick
everybody out of here?

13
00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:01.947
How about I get
this little guy to bed?

14
00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:07.039
- Yeah.

15
00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:25.406
- Hey... you wanna turn in?

16
00:02:25.536 --> 00:02:27.582
I can finish the rest.

17
00:02:31.412 --> 00:02:34.632
- What am I supposed to do now?

18
00:02:34.763 --> 00:02:36.852
This wasn't supposed to happen.

19
00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:41.117
I can't do this.

20
00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:47.036
- Look at me. Yes. you can.

21
00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.212
- No. I can't.
- I'm gonna be here.

22
00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:51.301
For you and Tyson.

23
00:02:51.432 --> 00:02:53.347
And I will always be here.

24
00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:54.609
Do you hear me?
I promise you.

25
00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.915
You're my best friend.

26
00:02:57.002 --> 00:02:59.396
- Okay.

27
00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:03.313
I know.

28
00:03:05.881 --> 00:03:08.057
I got you. I got you.

29
00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:15.020
I know.

30
00:03:15.107 --> 00:03:16.500
I know.

31
00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:08.857
- Sun.

32
00:04:08.944 --> 00:04:10.728
Spun.

33
00:04:13.427 --> 00:04:16.821
Fun.

34
00:04:16.908 --> 00:04:20.129
Autumn.

35
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.392
Ah. it smells so good!

36
00:04:22.523 --> 00:04:25.656
- Coffee's ready!
- Ah. I can't wait.

37
00:04:25.787 --> 00:04:29.225
- Ooh! Did you write
anything good this morning?

38
00:04:29.312 --> 00:04:31.053
- Maybe.

39
00:04:31.183 --> 00:04:33.403
- Well. can I read it?
- No.

40
00:04:33.534 --> 00:04:36.276
- And what is the point
of poetry
if you're not gonna share it?

41
00:04:36.406 --> 00:04:38.756
- This isn't just poetry.
it's my journal.

42
00:04:38.887 --> 00:04:41.498
and I'm just... not ready to...

43
00:04:41.585 --> 00:04:46.329
Lori. I told you. you don't need
to pay me rent.

44
00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:47.983
You stayed.

45
00:04:48.113 --> 00:04:49.985
- Oh. stop.

46
00:04:50.072 --> 00:04:51.595
- You do this every month.

47
00:04:51.726 --> 00:04:53.989
- Yeah. and every month. I win.

48
00:04:56.774 --> 00:05:01.779
Come on. just let me contribute
until I find my own family.

49
00:05:01.866 --> 00:05:04.391
Speaking of. it's grocery day.

50
00:05:04.478 --> 00:05:06.567
so if you want anything special.
just let me know.

51
00:05:06.654 --> 00:05:08.743
- Pancakes. always.

52
00:05:08.873 --> 00:05:10.397
- Yes. that's a given.

53
00:05:10.484 --> 00:05:12.834
- Also. would you mind
running by the bank for me?

54
00:05:12.964 --> 00:05:14.792
I need Tyson's birth certificate
for his passport.

55
00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.359
- Yeah. of course.

56
00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.535
Oh. did you decide
where you guys are gonna go?

57
00:05:18.622 --> 00:05:20.798
- No. but we need to go
somewhere.

58
00:05:20.885 --> 00:05:24.280
Like an adventure.

59
00:05:24.411 --> 00:05:29.024
If Tom were here. he would've
taken him somewhere.

60
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:32.027
- Somewhere amazing. I know.

61
00:05:32.157 --> 00:05:33.376
- Yeah.

62
00:05:35.944 --> 00:05:39.991
There he is! The little slugger.
- Tyson! Tyson! Tyson!

63
00:05:40.078 --> 00:05:42.254
- Guys. it's just a game.

64
00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:44.996
- Just a game? What?

65
00:05:45.127 --> 00:05:46.389
This is the season opener!

66
00:05:48.913 --> 00:05:52.003
- Look at that.

67
00:05:52.134 --> 00:05:54.005
- Thanks. Lori.
- Hey!

68
00:05:54.136 --> 00:05:56.617
Why don't we hit the cages
one more time
before the big game?

69
00:05:56.747 --> 00:05:58.053
- Yes. please.

70
00:05:58.183 --> 00:05:59.707
- Yes.

71
00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:20.945
- Yes! Tyson!

72
00:06:29.737 --> 00:06:31.782
Tyson!

73
00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:33.915
Oh. I'm sorry.

74
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:44.839
- Yes. Tyson! Come on!

75
00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:46.667
- Hi!
- Hi.

76
00:06:46.754 --> 00:06:49.582
- Can I get a hot dog. please?
- A hot dog. please.

77
00:06:49.713 --> 00:06:52.803
- That's your boy. right?
- Yep.

78
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:56.328
- He's a fine hitter.
- Thanks. He loves the game.

79
00:06:56.459 --> 00:06:58.418
- You know. hitting a baseball

80
00:06:58.505 --> 00:07:00.376
is one of the hardest things
to do in sports.

81
00:07:00.507 --> 00:07:02.596
You ever think about getting him
on a travel league?

82
00:07:02.683 --> 00:07:05.337
- Oh. um. no. not really.

83
00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:07.514
- You gotta get
through try-outs.

84
00:07:07.644 --> 00:07:09.559
but it opens up possibilities.

85
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:12.780
Colleges. scholarships.

86
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.086
- You think Tyson could make it?

87
00:07:15.217 --> 00:07:17.785
- Well... I am the coach. so...

88
00:07:27.925 --> 00:07:28.970
- Yes!

89
00:07:34.105 --> 00:07:35.716
- Here's your hot dog.
- Thank you.

90
00:07:35.846 --> 00:07:37.761
- Hey. Dad.
- Hey.

91
00:07:37.848 --> 00:07:41.373
- Oh. can I have one?
- Sure.

92
00:07:41.461 --> 00:07:45.116
- Ma'am. uh... wanna go
on a date with my dad?

93
00:07:45.203 --> 00:07:47.641
Oh.

94
00:07:47.728 --> 00:07:49.730
- Greg.
- What? She's cute.

95
00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.254
- Oh. well.
- Sorry.

96
00:07:52.384 --> 00:07:55.126
My... my son's very forward.

97
00:07:55.213 --> 00:07:58.390
- Well. he's very polite.
- Yes.

98
00:07:58.478 --> 00:08:02.090
I'll get you one. okay?

99
00:08:02.177 --> 00:08:04.701
And...

100
00:08:04.788 --> 00:08:08.009
...if you'd be open to it.
I'd like to see you again.

101
00:08:10.446 --> 00:08:14.189
- Oh. I'm... I...
I don't know.

102
00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:18.672
- Tell you what.
I'll give you my number. and...

103
00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:26.201
...if you wanna call me.
I'd like that.

104
00:08:30.379 --> 00:08:32.467
I'm Randy. by the way.

105
00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:35.123
Randy Roth.

106
00:08:45.699 --> 00:08:47.265
- Bye!

107
00:08:47.352 --> 00:08:49.616
Oh. my God. Oh. my God.

108
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.235
Okay.

109
00:09:07.634 --> 00:09:09.287
- Hi there. you've reached
Randy and Greg Roth.

110
00:09:09.418 --> 00:09:11.463
Leave a message.

111
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:13.944
And if this is the beautiful
lady I met at the game today.

112
00:09:14.075 --> 00:09:16.033
please don't hang up.
I wasn't kidding.

113
00:09:16.164 --> 00:09:18.253
I'd really like
to see you again.

114
00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:27.305
- 555-9187. Call me.

115
00:09:31.222 --> 00:09:33.877
Oh. my God.

116
00:09:45.106 --> 00:09:47.108
- Hi. I'm Randy.

117
00:09:47.238 --> 00:09:49.850
- Yeah. I know. I... I'm Lori.

118
00:09:49.937 --> 00:09:52.766
Come on in.
- Thanks.

119
00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:57.466
Yeah. Cindy mentioned
she had a roommate.

120
00:09:57.553 --> 00:09:59.816
- Yeah. it's an unusual
arrangement.

121
00:09:59.947 --> 00:10:01.513
but we make it work.

122
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:03.820
- Uh-huh.

123
00:10:03.907 --> 00:10:06.127
- Cindy will be right down.
- Great.

124
00:10:18.748 --> 00:10:21.533
So. you two own this place
together. or...?

125
00:10:21.621 --> 00:10:23.884
- Oh. actually.
this is Cindy's house.

126
00:10:23.971 --> 00:10:26.495
I just pay a little rent.

127
00:10:26.626 --> 00:10:30.107
- Hmm. she must have
a really good job.

128
00:10:30.194 --> 00:10:33.589
- Well. actually. her late
husband was very successful.

129
00:10:33.676 --> 00:10:34.938
- Oh.

130
00:10:38.899 --> 00:10:41.118
- Do you wanna have a drink
or anything before you go?

131
00:10:41.205 --> 00:10:43.555
- Oh. I don't drink or smoke.

132
00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:47.211
Single parent. don't really have
time for those kinds of things.

133
00:10:47.298 --> 00:10:49.300
- And what do you do?
If you don't mind me asking?

134
00:10:49.431 --> 00:10:51.520
- I'm a mechanic
at the Perry dealership.

135
00:10:51.607 --> 00:10:54.001
There she is!

136
00:10:54.131 --> 00:10:56.046
- Ooh!

137
00:10:56.133 --> 00:10:57.874
- You look... wow!

138
00:11:00.094 --> 00:11:02.531
- I was afraid this old thing
was devoured by moths.

139
00:11:02.662 --> 00:11:04.315
- These are for you.

140
00:11:04.402 --> 00:11:07.754
- Ah. thank you.
- You're welcome.

141
00:11:07.841 --> 00:11:09.799
I'm really glad you called.

142
00:11:09.930 --> 00:11:12.106
Greg was pretty happy too.

143
00:11:12.193 --> 00:11:15.196
- Aww. he's a cute kid.

144
00:11:15.326 --> 00:11:18.242
- Well. I will put these
in water for you.

145
00:11:18.329 --> 00:11:19.679
- Thank you.

146
00:11:19.809 --> 00:11:22.769
- And you two kids have fun.
- We will.

147
00:11:22.899 --> 00:11:24.727
I'll be sure to have her home
before midnight.

148
00:11:30.428 --> 00:11:32.387
What kind of food do you like?

149
00:11:32.517 --> 00:11:34.040
- Any food.

150
00:11:34.128 --> 00:11:35.782
- Feel like Italian?
- I love Italian.

151
00:11:35.912 --> 00:11:38.480
- That's my specialty.

152
00:11:50.971 --> 00:11:53.451
- What?

153
00:11:53.538 --> 00:11:56.280
- You okay?

154
00:11:56.367 --> 00:11:57.891
- Yeah.

155
00:12:00.328 --> 00:12:03.505
- You know you can
talk to me. right?

156
00:12:03.592 --> 00:12:06.769
- I mean... it's a little weird.

157
00:12:06.856 --> 00:12:09.772
Mom on a date.

158
00:12:09.859 --> 00:12:13.733
But she should get to have
a little fun too. I guess.

159
00:12:15.952 --> 00:12:20.391
I always got you. right?

160
00:12:20.478 --> 00:12:22.393
- You bet. kid.

161
00:12:28.617 --> 00:12:30.097
Popcorn fight!

162
00:12:35.406 --> 00:12:38.061
- You're sure
you don't want some?

163
00:12:38.148 --> 00:12:40.107
- Oh. no.
I really don't do sugar.

164
00:12:40.237 --> 00:12:42.370
but don't let me stop you.

165
00:12:45.547 --> 00:12:48.593
So...

166
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.466
Greg seems like a nice boy.
- He sure is.

167
00:12:55.644 --> 00:12:57.602
You can ask me if you want to.

168
00:12:59.735 --> 00:13:01.476
- You got me.

169
00:13:01.563 --> 00:13:03.739
Is Greg's mom
still in the picture?

170
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:05.480
Because I would never...
- No.

171
00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.612
We lost her.

172
00:13:11.442 --> 00:13:14.358
Janis.

173
00:13:14.445 --> 00:13:18.319
That was her name.
She was a great mom.

174
00:13:18.406 --> 00:13:19.973
I'm sure.

175
00:13:23.498 --> 00:13:26.806
- Cindy.

176
00:13:26.936 --> 00:13:29.069
There is something
I need to tell you.

177
00:13:31.854 --> 00:13:35.423
I really would like a bite
of that ice cream.

178
00:13:38.905 --> 00:13:42.169
- It is really good.
- Yeah?

179
00:13:42.256 --> 00:13:44.127
Oh. my gosh!
- Mm-hmm.

180
00:13:44.258 --> 00:13:46.042
I tried telling you.

181
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:47.696
- It is so good!

182
00:14:00.317 --> 00:14:02.102
Anytime.

183
00:14:04.887 --> 00:14:06.541
I'll call you.

184
00:14:06.671 --> 00:14:08.282
- Bye.

185
00:14:19.249 --> 00:14:21.512
- Okay. it either went

186
00:14:21.643 --> 00:14:23.471
amazing or absolutely awful

187
00:14:23.558 --> 00:14:24.733
if you're already
writing about it.

188
00:14:26.953 --> 00:14:28.563
- No. no peeking!

189
00:14:28.693 --> 00:14:30.957
I'm not done with it yet.

190
00:14:31.087 --> 00:14:32.959
- Okay. well. then.
give me the play by play.

191
00:14:33.089 --> 00:14:35.091
- Oh. he's...

192
00:14:35.222 --> 00:14:38.703
he's... so charming.

193
00:14:38.790 --> 00:14:40.880
and thoughtful.

194
00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.970
and. I mean.
he really listens.

195
00:14:44.057 --> 00:14:45.754
which is no small feat
for a man.

196
00:14:47.799 --> 00:14:50.759
What can I say? He's...

197
00:14:50.846 --> 00:14:52.892
...he's amazing.

198
00:14:54.981 --> 00:14:58.506
- I'm waiting for the "but."

199
00:14:58.636 --> 00:15:01.726
- Well. he lost his wife.

200
00:15:01.813 --> 00:15:03.554
- He's a widower?

201
00:15:03.685 --> 00:15:06.209
- Two years now.
- Really?

202
00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:10.431
I didn't get that from him.

203
00:15:10.518 --> 00:15:13.869
- Well... we both know
how difficult that can be.
don't we?

204
00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.264
- Sure.

205
00:15:20.963 --> 00:15:24.053
- You don't think I'm making
a terrible mistake. do you?

206
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:26.926
- No.

207
00:15:27.013 --> 00:15:28.536
- You approve?

208
00:15:28.666 --> 00:15:31.147
- Not so fast. we'll see.

209
00:15:45.727 --> 00:15:48.512
- Hi! Oh. you must be
the best friend. Lori. right?

210
00:15:48.599 --> 00:15:50.819
- That's me. And you are?
- Hi.

211
00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.343
I'm Megan.
This is my husband. John.

212
00:15:53.474 --> 00:15:57.043
and that's our...
well. John's daughter. Dana.

213
00:15:57.173 --> 00:15:59.610
- Oh. it's nice to meet you.
- Good to meet you.

214
00:15:59.697 --> 00:16:01.351
- How long have you guys
known Randy?

215
00:16:01.482 --> 00:16:04.050
- Ah. it's going on five years
now for me.

216
00:16:04.180 --> 00:16:06.748
- Yeah. Randy and John
are thick as thieves.

217
00:16:06.835 --> 00:16:08.228
Oh. Dana. honey.

218
00:16:08.358 --> 00:16:11.057
Dana. come meet someone.

219
00:16:11.187 --> 00:16:13.929
Dana?
- Dana!

220
00:16:14.060 --> 00:16:17.063
- Uh. teenagers. right?

221
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:20.414
And the divorce adds to it too.
you know.

222
00:16:20.501 --> 00:16:22.285
Well. I better deliver
the salad.

223
00:16:22.416 --> 00:16:24.287
It's so good to meet you.

224
00:16:24.374 --> 00:16:27.029
- Don't dress them
until they've been cut.

225
00:16:27.116 --> 00:16:29.075
That way.
the oil soaks in better.

226
00:16:29.205 --> 00:16:32.078
Then. some olive oil.

227
00:16:32.208 --> 00:16:34.558
And...

228
00:16:34.645 --> 00:16:35.995
...a touch of salt.

229
00:16:36.082 --> 00:16:38.084
- I can't wait.

230
00:16:38.214 --> 00:16:39.955
Oh. and I started eating spinach

231
00:16:40.086 --> 00:16:42.175
with my eggs in the morning.
just like you showed me.

232
00:16:42.305 --> 00:16:43.959
- And you feel full longer.
right?

233
00:16:44.046 --> 00:16:45.743
- Yeah. all the way until lunch.

234
00:16:45.874 --> 00:16:48.007
- It's good. sweetheart.

235
00:16:48.137 --> 00:16:50.879
Hey. would you do me a favour
and go inside and get me
some more tin foil?

236
00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.707
- Mm-hmm.

237
00:16:56.537 --> 00:16:58.017
- Hmm.

238
00:16:58.147 --> 00:17:00.497
- I know.
she's like a second kid.

239
00:17:00.584 --> 00:17:02.456
- I wasn't gonna say anything.

240
00:17:02.586 --> 00:17:04.196
- She had a rough patch.

241
00:17:04.284 --> 00:17:06.938
It was a nasty divorce.

242
00:17:07.069 --> 00:17:08.636
Trouble at school.

243
00:17:08.766 --> 00:17:12.727
It might have had to do with her
struggling with her weight.

244
00:17:12.814 --> 00:17:14.990
I was just showing her
some healthier habits.

245
00:17:15.077 --> 00:17:18.298
- Mm-hmm.
Well. that's very sweet.

246
00:17:28.873 --> 00:17:31.615
- Her hair had one. not two.
Yeah.

247
00:17:44.802 --> 00:17:46.369
...on the wall.

248
00:17:46.456 --> 00:17:47.979
- Excuse me.

249
00:17:48.067 --> 00:17:51.374
I just... don't mean
to interrupt.

250
00:17:51.461 --> 00:17:56.205
I just wanted to say
what a pleasure it is
to host you all.

251
00:17:56.336 --> 00:17:59.817
Some of my best
and oldest friends.

252
00:17:59.904 --> 00:18:02.081
and some great new ones too.

253
00:18:02.211 --> 00:18:04.474
And if that wasn't enough
to celebrate.

254
00:18:04.561 --> 00:18:09.827
I just learned here
that this lovely young lady...

255
00:18:09.914 --> 00:18:11.742
...has lost three pounds.

256
00:18:11.829 --> 00:18:14.180
- Way to go. sweetheart.
- Way to go. Dana!

257
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:16.878
- We are so very proud of you.

258
00:18:16.965 --> 00:18:18.619
- Randy made a deal with her.

259
00:18:18.749 --> 00:18:22.579
He gives her $100
for every pound.

260
00:18:22.666 --> 00:18:24.712
- Great job. sweetheart.
- Thanks.

261
00:18:26.844 --> 00:18:29.020
You see this? One. two. three.

262
00:19:01.792 --> 00:19:03.359
- Two tours.

263
00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:06.841
Active duty.

264
00:19:06.971 --> 00:19:09.060
Oh. you shouldn't have
to do that.

265
00:19:09.191 --> 00:19:10.714
Greg!

266
00:19:10.845 --> 00:19:12.934
Greg. come in here. son!

267
00:19:13.021 --> 00:19:15.502
Greg!

268
00:19:15.589 --> 00:19:17.156
You take care of these?

269
00:19:17.286 --> 00:19:20.333
- I can take those. ma'am.
- Thank you.

270
00:19:23.074 --> 00:19:24.685
He's so polite.

271
00:19:24.815 --> 00:19:26.600
- That's what we learn
in the service.

272
00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:29.516
Chivalry. honour. order.

273
00:19:32.432 --> 00:19:33.781
It was pretty nasty over there.

274
00:19:38.481 --> 00:19:42.398
- Do you mind if I ask you
how you lost your...

275
00:19:42.529 --> 00:19:43.834
- Janis.

276
00:19:43.921 --> 00:19:47.229
- I'm so sorry.

277
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.709
- Yeah.

278
00:19:53.366 --> 00:19:56.934
It was an accident.

279
00:19:57.065 --> 00:19:58.980
Janis loved climbing.

280
00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.895
We were on Mount Rainier.

281
00:20:01.025 --> 00:20:03.854
She slipped. fell.
dead on impact.

282
00:20:07.118 --> 00:20:10.078
- Uh... I'm... That's horrible.

283
00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:11.819
- Yeah.

284
00:20:31.752 --> 00:20:33.971
Hey. guys.
- Hey.

285
00:20:34.102 --> 00:20:35.625
- You guys having a good time?

286
00:20:35.756 --> 00:20:36.887
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

287
00:20:39.542 --> 00:20:42.589
- Well. what do you think?

288
00:20:44.591 --> 00:20:47.158
- Uh... wow!

289
00:20:47.246 --> 00:20:48.943
It's... it's beautiful.

290
00:20:49.073 --> 00:20:50.945
- No. not about the ring.
about the man.

291
00:20:51.075 --> 00:20:52.860
What do you think about Randy?

292
00:20:52.947 --> 00:20:55.079
I mean. I know it's only been
a few months.

293
00:20:55.166 --> 00:20:57.734
but I just... I feel like...

294
00:20:57.865 --> 00:20:59.867
Like. this just feels right.

295
00:20:59.954 --> 00:21:02.348
I feel like he's the one.

296
00:21:02.435 --> 00:21:05.873
- Well. you did say
you did just start dating. so...

297
00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:07.396
maybe it is a good idea

298
00:21:07.483 --> 00:21:09.355
just to date a few other men.
just to see.

299
00:21:09.442 --> 00:21:13.141
- Are you kidding?
Randy's perfect.

300
00:21:13.228 --> 00:21:16.231
Tyson is finally gonna have
a father again.

301
00:21:16.362 --> 00:21:19.843
- Okay. Cindy. I'm just gonna
be honest with you.

302
00:21:19.974 --> 00:21:24.195
Listen. I know he seems nice.
and he's charming.

303
00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:27.547
To you. at least.
and to Tyson too.

304
00:21:27.634 --> 00:21:30.158
but other times. he's--
- Lori.

305
00:21:32.769 --> 00:21:34.989
I'm okay.

306
00:21:35.076 --> 00:21:38.340
You don't have
to protect me anymore.

307
00:21:38.471 --> 00:21:40.864
I love you.

308
00:21:40.995 --> 00:21:42.562
- I love you too.

309
00:21:49.264 --> 00:21:51.875
- Alright. everyone. cheers!
To my amazing new family.

310
00:21:52.006 --> 00:21:54.661
Cheers!

311
00:21:54.748 --> 00:21:58.229
- Woo-hoo!

312
00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.622
- This cider is so good.

313
00:21:59.709 --> 00:22:01.624
- Thanks. Mr. Roth.
- No. it's "Dad." now.

314
00:22:01.711 --> 00:22:04.018
Or Coach. Either one is fine.

315
00:22:06.847 --> 00:22:08.544
Greg. would you mind
grabbing another one for me?

316
00:22:08.675 --> 00:22:10.459
- Yes. sir.

317
00:22:10.546 --> 00:22:12.331
- That's good. Yeah.
- That's pretty good.

318
00:22:19.207 --> 00:22:21.601
- So. Greg. how are you feeling?

319
00:22:21.731 --> 00:22:23.907
New family. new brother.

320
00:22:24.038 --> 00:22:25.431
- Good. ma'am.

321
00:22:25.518 --> 00:22:29.217
Tyson's cool. and his mom
is. like. really nice.

322
00:22:29.304 --> 00:22:31.611
- Well. having known Cindy
for 20 years.

323
00:22:31.741 --> 00:22:33.264
I can say she's amazing.

324
00:22:33.395 --> 00:22:35.310
- Yeah. they always are.

325
00:22:38.879 --> 00:22:40.359
- Go ahead. son.

326
00:22:44.537 --> 00:22:46.321
I just wanna
let you know that...

327
00:22:46.408 --> 00:22:48.758
you're welcome here
as long as you like.

328
00:22:48.845 --> 00:22:51.326
- What?

329
00:22:51.457 --> 00:22:54.111
- Me and Greg. we're moving in.

330
00:22:54.198 --> 00:22:57.724
But. like I said. you can
stay here as long as you want.

331
00:22:57.854 --> 00:22:59.465
No pressure.

332
00:23:03.686 --> 00:23:05.384
Excuse me.

333
00:23:19.659 --> 00:23:22.009
No. no! Stop!

334
00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.319
- Hey. buddy. are you okay?

335
00:23:30.496 --> 00:23:33.760
- Cindy! Hey!
What's going on?

336
00:23:35.283 --> 00:23:36.763
Oh. my God! Randy!

337
00:23:42.725 --> 00:23:45.380
Oh my God. Randy.
get off of her!

338
00:23:45.511 --> 00:23:48.818
Get off of her! Stop it!
Get off!

339
00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:52.605
Cindy! Are you okay?

340
00:23:54.737 --> 00:23:56.696
Come here.

341
00:23:56.826 --> 00:23:58.480
Are you okay?

342
00:23:58.567 --> 00:24:00.177
- Honey. I'm so sorry.

343
00:24:00.264 --> 00:24:02.005
- Stay away from her!
- No. Lori.

344
00:24:02.136 --> 00:24:04.791
- Get away from her!
- Lori. Lori. it's okay.

345
00:24:04.878 --> 00:24:07.358
- No. are you kidding? No!
- Yes. just go. Please go.

346
00:24:07.489 --> 00:24:08.969
- What?
- Get the hell out of here!

347
00:24:09.056 --> 00:24:10.840
- Go. go. go! Lori. go!

348
00:24:10.971 --> 00:24:14.540
- No. are you kidding?
- Please go!

349
00:24:16.846 --> 00:24:18.195
- What?

350
00:24:24.201 --> 00:24:26.726
Hey.

351
00:24:32.558 --> 00:24:34.647
- You okay?

352
00:24:34.734 --> 00:24:36.300
Shh. it's okay.

353
00:24:36.387 --> 00:24:38.041
It's okay.

354
00:24:38.128 --> 00:24:41.088
Shh. it's okay.
Oh. God.

355
00:24:41.175 --> 00:24:44.134
It's okay.

356
00:24:44.221 --> 00:24:45.788
- Alright. boys.
10 jumping jacks.

357
00:24:45.919 --> 00:24:47.529
Ready?

358
00:24:47.616 --> 00:24:49.096
That's it!

359
00:24:49.226 --> 00:24:53.753
To be the best. you need
to train like the best!

360
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:56.407
- Cindy. about last night...

361
00:24:56.495 --> 00:24:58.279
- Uh...

362
00:24:58.366 --> 00:25:01.195
Randy has PTSD.

363
00:25:01.282 --> 00:25:05.112
Admittedly. I didn't realize

364
00:25:05.199 --> 00:25:08.724
how severe
those emotions can be.

365
00:25:08.855 --> 00:25:11.118
He saw a lot of bad stuff
over there.

366
00:25:11.205 --> 00:25:12.902
- He was hurting you.

367
00:25:12.989 --> 00:25:14.469
- Yeah.

368
00:25:14.556 --> 00:25:16.166
He's working through it.

369
00:25:16.253 --> 00:25:18.038
- But Cindy. you can't just...

370
00:25:18.125 --> 00:25:20.214
- He's my husband.

371
00:25:20.301 --> 00:25:21.998
That's all there is to it.

372
00:25:23.434 --> 00:25:26.394
One. two. three. four.

373
00:25:26.481 --> 00:25:29.658
five. six!

374
00:25:29.789 --> 00:25:31.486
High knees!

375
00:25:31.573 --> 00:25:33.227
Come on! You got this!

376
00:25:51.637 --> 00:25:54.248
- Hey. honey. it's okay.
It's not a big deal.

377
00:25:54.378 --> 00:25:55.684
- I'm sorry.

378
00:25:55.771 --> 00:25:57.512
- Hey.

379
00:25:57.599 --> 00:26:00.733
It's okay. it's okay.
You're okay.

380
00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.430
- Are you gonna tell my dad?

381
00:26:02.517 --> 00:26:03.910
- Greg. time for school!

382
00:26:10.307 --> 00:26:12.266
You hear me. bud?

383
00:26:12.353 --> 00:26:16.183
We gotta go.
- Yes. sir.

384
00:26:26.149 --> 00:26:28.369
- Here's some salad.
- Can I have some garlic bread?

385
00:26:28.456 --> 00:26:31.328
- Yes.
- Yeah.

386
00:26:31.459 --> 00:26:33.766
- Here we go!

387
00:26:33.896 --> 00:26:36.986
Veal parmesan with a pesto pasta

388
00:26:37.073 --> 00:26:39.554
and sauce tomate à la...

389
00:26:39.641 --> 00:26:41.948
- Wow. that looks exceptional.

390
00:26:42.035 --> 00:26:45.299
- His veal parm is the best.

391
00:26:45.386 --> 00:26:48.389
- Thank you. honey.

392
00:26:48.476 --> 00:26:50.130
Well. enjoy it while it lasts.

393
00:26:50.260 --> 00:26:53.786
because for the next five days.
chef Randy is going on vacation.

394
00:26:53.873 --> 00:26:56.615
- Buenos Aires...
It sounds so fancy.

395
00:26:56.702 --> 00:26:58.878
- We will exclusively
be dining out.

396
00:26:58.965 --> 00:27:00.793
- Don't worry. guys. I'm a star

397
00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:02.969
when it comes to anything
microwaveable.

398
00:27:03.099 --> 00:27:05.014
- Well. I wouldn't have minded
to watch Greg and Tyson

399
00:27:05.145 --> 00:27:06.755
while you guys
are on your honeymoon.

400
00:27:06.842 --> 00:27:08.627
Although. I don't mind
the extra help. Dana.

401
00:27:08.757 --> 00:27:10.541
- Oh. that's okay.
Dana is just trying

402
00:27:10.672 --> 00:27:12.631
to earn some extra money
for senior week.

403
00:27:12.718 --> 00:27:14.633
Speaking of.

404
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.983
there's a scale in the bathroom.
young lass.

405
00:27:21.378 --> 00:27:24.512
- Oh. and actually.
tomorrow is grocery day.

406
00:27:24.599 --> 00:27:26.035
so if you have anything
you want special.

407
00:27:26.166 --> 00:27:27.994
let me know. besides pancakes.
- Aww.

408
00:27:28.081 --> 00:27:30.257
- That's very generous.
but I've already got it covered.

409
00:27:30.387 --> 00:27:32.389
I only buy organic.

410
00:27:32.476 --> 00:27:34.087
- Randy's more
into eggs and bacon.

411
00:27:34.174 --> 00:27:36.350
- Protein is a healthier way
to start the day.

412
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.873
but I'm sure you knew that.

413
00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.788
- Four pounds!

414
00:27:39.875 --> 00:27:41.660
- Dana. you're crushing it!
- Alright!

415
00:27:45.968 --> 00:27:48.449
There you go. Well done.

416
00:27:48.579 --> 00:27:51.844
- Well. I think you look
beautiful either way. honey.

417
00:27:54.716 --> 00:27:56.762
- She sure does.

418
00:28:06.075 --> 00:28:09.905
- Our winter is their summer.
so it's spring-ish right now.

419
00:28:09.992 --> 00:28:11.951
- Do you have enough pink?

420
00:28:13.692 --> 00:28:17.304
- Don't mess with my pink.
missy.

421
00:28:17.391 --> 00:28:20.046
- Hey. can I ask you a question?

422
00:28:20.176 --> 00:28:24.441
What is the deal
between Randy and Dana?

423
00:28:24.528 --> 00:28:26.356
- What do you mean?

424
00:28:26.443 --> 00:28:29.403
- He's just awfully friendly
with her. don't you think?

425
00:28:33.102 --> 00:28:35.322
- Randy's helping her through
a difficult part of her life.

426
00:28:35.452 --> 00:28:36.889
What's wrong with that?

427
00:28:43.286 --> 00:28:44.810
- You need a hat.

428
00:28:44.897 --> 00:28:47.247
- I love this!

429
00:28:47.377 --> 00:28:49.336
Woo!

430
00:28:49.423 --> 00:28:51.686
What do you think?
Buenos Aires?

431
00:28:51.817 --> 00:28:53.862
- Yes.

432
00:28:53.949 --> 00:28:57.474
- I guess I'll have to wear it
on the plane.

433
00:28:57.561 --> 00:29:00.129
- How about everything else?

434
00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.479
Now that you are
a newly married woman.

435
00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:04.177
- It's great.

436
00:29:04.264 --> 00:29:06.005
Well. you know. you live here.

437
00:29:06.135 --> 00:29:09.443
- Well. I was referring
to other marital things.

438
00:29:09.530 --> 00:29:13.795
- Oh. right.

439
00:29:13.926 --> 00:29:17.059
Well. as you know.
Randy is very fit.

440
00:29:17.146 --> 00:29:18.408
- Yes. I noticed.

441
00:29:18.495 --> 00:29:19.845
- And vigorous.

442
00:29:19.932 --> 00:29:21.194
- Oh!

443
00:29:21.281 --> 00:29:22.543
- But...

444
00:29:25.328 --> 00:29:29.855
...that vigour hasn't exactly
translated to the marital bed.

445
00:29:29.942 --> 00:29:31.552
- Well. hey.

446
00:29:31.682 --> 00:29:33.641
I'm sure
a sexy little number.

447
00:29:33.728 --> 00:29:35.556
a picturesque honeymoon...

448
00:29:35.643 --> 00:29:37.601
That will change very quickly.

449
00:29:37.688 --> 00:29:40.517
Okay. this is not gonna help
with the vigour.

450
00:29:40.604 --> 00:29:43.129
so this does not go.

451
00:29:43.259 --> 00:29:45.392
- Those were my favourite!
- No.

452
00:29:45.479 --> 00:29:47.698
- And you'll take care of Tyson
while I'm gone?

453
00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:49.396
You know he hasn't been
without me since Tom.

454
00:29:49.483 --> 00:29:51.093
- You know I will.

455
00:29:51.224 --> 00:29:53.443
- Ooh! And don't forget
he has his game on Saturday.

456
00:29:53.530 --> 00:29:54.923
- Of course.

457
00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:56.620
- And the grocery list
is on the fridge.

458
00:29:56.707 --> 00:29:57.970
- You got it.
- And vitamins at night.

459
00:29:58.057 --> 00:29:59.362
- I know. I know.

460
00:29:59.493 --> 00:30:00.799
- His vitamins are next
to his bed.

461
00:30:00.886 --> 00:30:02.409
- Would you get out of here?

462
00:30:19.208 --> 00:30:21.254
- Sorry.
- Excuse me.

463
00:30:21.384 --> 00:30:24.561
- Are you okay?

464
00:30:24.692 --> 00:30:26.346
- Yeah. I'm fine.

465
00:30:28.783 --> 00:30:32.352
- Dana. has Randy ever hurt you?

466
00:30:32.439 --> 00:30:37.444
Well. I'm just curious
if Randy has ever exhibited...

467
00:30:37.531 --> 00:30:39.750
symptoms of PTSD?

468
00:30:39.838 --> 00:30:42.057
Anything that's dangerous
or worrisome?

469
00:30:42.188 --> 00:30:44.364
- If he did. I would think
his family would support him
about it.

470
00:30:46.801 --> 00:30:49.891
Why are you living here again?

471
00:30:49.978 --> 00:30:52.372
Aren't you. like.
in your forties?

472
00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.224
- Wow.

473
00:31:23.882 --> 00:31:25.361
Wow.

474
00:31:27.711 --> 00:31:29.496
My new wife.

475
00:31:29.583 --> 00:31:31.237
- Aww.

476
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.081
- My new husband.

477
00:32:03.791 --> 00:32:05.010
- Cindy.

478
00:32:05.140 --> 00:32:07.273
Tonight. I want you...

479
00:32:10.015 --> 00:32:12.843
...to bare your all to me.

480
00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:14.106
Will you?

481
00:32:21.548 --> 00:32:24.290
- Hmm... I bare my all.

482
00:32:24.377 --> 00:32:25.682
- You are mine...

483
00:32:27.206 --> 00:32:29.077
...to hold and to feel.

484
00:32:35.170 --> 00:32:37.129
Go on.

485
00:32:39.958 --> 00:32:43.135
- Hmm...

486
00:32:43.222 --> 00:32:44.614
- Say it.

487
00:32:48.183 --> 00:32:49.793
Say it.

488
00:32:52.057 --> 00:32:56.191
Say it.

489
00:32:56.322 --> 00:32:58.454
- I...

490
00:32:58.541 --> 00:33:00.152
...I'm yours...

491
00:33:00.282 --> 00:33:02.458
- Say it.
- ...to hold and feel.

492
00:33:06.897 --> 00:33:08.769
When you touch me. I'm real.

493
00:33:08.856 --> 00:33:12.338
- Again.

494
00:33:12.425 --> 00:33:15.341
- I am yours to hold
and to feel.
- Yeah.

495
00:33:15.428 --> 00:33:17.778
- When you touch me. I am real.

496
00:33:17.908 --> 00:33:20.520
- Yes. Say it again.

497
00:33:20.607 --> 00:33:22.609
- I bare my all.
- Louder.

498
00:33:22.696 --> 00:33:24.393
- I am yours to hold
and to feel.

499
00:33:26.047 --> 00:33:29.050
When you touch me. I am real.
- Yes.

500
00:33:29.137 --> 00:33:32.097
- I bare my all.

501
00:33:32.184 --> 00:33:33.837
- Ah. yes.
- I am yours...

502
00:33:33.968 --> 00:33:36.014
- Yes.
- ...to hold and to feel.

503
00:33:36.101 --> 00:33:38.929
- Yes.
- When you touch me. I am real.

504
00:33:44.370 --> 00:33:46.372
- Ah. shoot.

505
00:34:17.228 --> 00:34:19.753
Oh. my God.

506
00:34:26.455 --> 00:34:29.458
So... okay.
how was Buenos Aires?

507
00:34:29.545 --> 00:34:32.331
- Mmm... Wonderful.

508
00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:38.119
It's elegant and rich
with history and culture.

509
00:34:38.206 --> 00:34:40.078
Yeah. it was really fun.

510
00:34:40.165 --> 00:34:43.210
- And how about
the other marital stuff?

511
00:34:43.297 --> 00:34:46.214
Is it accelerating
the way that you hoped?

512
00:34:46.344 --> 00:34:47.955
- Yeah. it's great.

513
00:34:50.565 --> 00:34:52.655
- Good.

514
00:34:52.742 --> 00:34:54.657
- How was everything here?

515
00:34:54.788 --> 00:34:58.357
- Oh. well. everything
with Tyson was fine.

516
00:34:58.487 --> 00:35:02.361
but there was something weird
that happened.

517
00:35:02.448 --> 00:35:04.276
- What?

518
00:35:04.363 --> 00:35:05.929
- Well...

519
00:35:14.547 --> 00:35:16.897
I kinda found this.

520
00:35:18.812 --> 00:35:21.597
- Oh.

521
00:35:21.684 --> 00:35:23.512
Oh. my God.

522
00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:27.473
- I found it in one of Randy's
camping boxes in the basement.

523
00:35:30.171 --> 00:35:32.347
- So. you were snooping
through his stuff?

524
00:35:32.434 --> 00:35:34.480
- What? No. of course not.

525
00:35:34.567 --> 00:35:36.786
- It's kind of a weird thing
to just come across.

526
00:35:36.873 --> 00:35:38.745
- Well. it's kind of
a weird thing

527
00:35:38.875 --> 00:35:41.748
to keep in a plastic bag
in a box in the basement.

528
00:35:41.835 --> 00:35:43.750
I...
- You don't have to do that.

529
00:35:43.837 --> 00:35:47.536
- Do what?
- That. This.

530
00:35:47.667 --> 00:35:50.931
You never have anything nice
to say about Randy.

531
00:35:51.061 --> 00:35:53.716
and any opportunity you get
to say something bad.

532
00:35:53.803 --> 00:35:55.501
you jump all over it!

533
00:35:55.631 --> 00:35:56.937
- What would you rather me do?

534
00:35:57.067 --> 00:35:58.417
Would you rather me lie about--

535
00:35:58.504 --> 00:36:01.246
- I want you to be happy for me!

536
00:36:01.376 --> 00:36:02.638
Please.

537
00:36:05.424 --> 00:36:08.818
- Listen. I just don't think
that Randy is the one.

538
00:36:08.949 --> 00:36:11.081
We haven't known him that long.

539
00:36:11.169 --> 00:36:13.693
Every single thing I learn
about this guy. I mean...

540
00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:16.565
Greg is being raised
like a soldier.

541
00:36:16.652 --> 00:36:19.046
He's so afraid of his father
he's wetting the bed.

542
00:36:19.177 --> 00:36:22.789
And Dana has an eating disorder
Randy's basically making worse.

543
00:36:22.919 --> 00:36:26.009
And what kind of a new husband
doesn't want to sleep
with his new wife?

544
00:36:26.096 --> 00:36:29.709
- Hey. that is my husband
you're talking about. okay?!

545
00:36:29.796 --> 00:36:31.493
And what do you know
about marriage?

546
00:36:31.624 --> 00:36:33.365
Or men? Look at you.

547
00:36:33.452 --> 00:36:37.499
You're living in my house
with my kids and my husband!

548
00:36:45.725 --> 00:36:47.683
I think it's time you found
your own place.

549
00:36:50.904 --> 00:36:52.558
I'm sorry.

550
00:37:53.227 --> 00:37:55.011
- Hello. Lori.

551
00:37:55.142 --> 00:37:57.405
Oh... Lori Baker speaking.
I mean.

552
00:37:57.492 --> 00:37:59.668
- Lori. it's me.
Can you come over right away?

553
00:37:59.755 --> 00:38:01.279
- Hey. are you okay?

554
00:38:01.409 --> 00:38:02.932
- Hold on.

555
00:38:03.063 --> 00:38:04.630
What? I'm gonna be right there.

556
00:38:30.177 --> 00:38:33.528
- Thanks for coming so quickly.

557
00:38:33.659 --> 00:38:35.791
- Yeah. of course.
I'm happy to help.

558
00:38:35.922 --> 00:38:38.098
Are you okay?
Is Tyson okay?

559
00:38:38.185 --> 00:38:41.144
- Yeah. he's good.
I'm good. I'm...

560
00:38:41.231 --> 00:38:43.843
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to worry you.

561
00:38:43.973 --> 00:38:47.237
So...

562
00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:49.631
- Yeah. what's going on?
- I don't know.

563
00:38:49.718 --> 00:38:51.677
You were always so good
with cars.

564
00:38:51.807 --> 00:38:55.289
I just... can't get it to start.

565
00:38:55.376 --> 00:38:57.726
- Oh. well. did Randy
take a look at it?

566
00:38:57.857 --> 00:38:59.380
- Oh. no.

567
00:38:59.467 --> 00:39:02.731
I didn't want to bother him
at work.

568
00:39:02.862 --> 00:39:04.646
- Okay.

569
00:39:04.777 --> 00:39:06.344
Let me check it out.

570
00:39:09.085 --> 00:39:12.785
Alright. let's see.

571
00:39:12.872 --> 00:39:15.222
- Ah. thanks again.

572
00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:18.181
I just... needed to go
to the store.

573
00:39:18.268 --> 00:39:20.967
just. you know.
get out of the house.

574
00:39:21.054 --> 00:39:24.144
but then. this happened.

575
00:39:24.231 --> 00:39:26.233
- Huh.

576
00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:29.367
Uh. you know what?
Try it now.

577
00:39:42.684 --> 00:39:44.599
- You're a life saver.

578
00:39:44.686 --> 00:39:46.993
- It was just a fuse that needed
to be pushed back in.

579
00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:50.039
- Oh.

580
00:39:50.170 --> 00:39:52.955
- Maybe it came loose when you
went over a bump or something.

581
00:39:53.042 --> 00:39:56.263
- Yeah.

582
00:39:56.350 --> 00:39:59.484
- Well. hey. I'd really love
to see you and Tyson more

583
00:39:59.571 --> 00:40:04.314
if you maybe wanna grab dinner
on Sunday or this week.

584
00:40:04.445 --> 00:40:05.925
Anytime. really.

585
00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:10.320
Is everything okay?

586
00:40:10.408 --> 00:40:13.149
- It's good. I'm good.
- We're... I'm fine.

587
00:40:13.236 --> 00:40:15.891
- Okay.

588
00:40:16.022 --> 00:40:19.025
Well. dinner this week?

589
00:40:19.112 --> 00:40:23.246
- Yeah. I'll check my calendar.

590
00:40:23.333 --> 00:40:24.770
- Okay.

591
00:40:27.947 --> 00:40:30.776
Alright. well...
I'll see you soon.

592
00:40:30.863 --> 00:40:34.257
- See you soon.

593
00:40:40.699 --> 00:40:43.136
What are you doing?!

594
00:40:43.223 --> 00:40:46.705
Yeah. just what you need.
more crap from the store!

595
00:40:46.835 --> 00:40:50.839
This isn't even organic.

596
00:40:50.926 --> 00:40:53.712
I specifically told you
to stay home!

597
00:40:53.842 --> 00:40:55.496
Look at this.

598
00:40:55.627 --> 00:40:58.847
Here's an idea:
more ugly pink garbage.

599
00:40:58.978 --> 00:41:00.936
Oh. and a small!

600
00:41:01.023 --> 00:41:03.199
That's ambitious!

601
00:41:03.286 --> 00:41:05.158
What did I say. huh?

602
00:41:05.245 --> 00:41:07.073
What did I say?
- Just...

603
00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.336
- No more bleaching your hair!

604
00:41:09.423 --> 00:41:11.425
This crap is filled
with chemicals!

605
00:41:11.556 --> 00:41:13.296
I am your husband!

606
00:41:13.427 --> 00:41:15.429
Doesn't that mean
anything to you?

607
00:41:15.516 --> 00:41:17.518
Don't you care about yourself?

608
00:41:17.649 --> 00:41:19.651
When I tell you to do something.
you do it!

609
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:40.541
Cindy!

610
00:41:40.628 --> 00:41:43.326
Cindy. get in here!

611
00:41:50.856 --> 00:41:52.161
- Hey.

612
00:41:52.248 --> 00:41:54.120
- Where were you?

613
00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:56.644
- Just... laundry.

614
00:41:59.865 --> 00:42:01.519
- You know. I was talking
to the boys

615
00:42:01.606 --> 00:42:03.216
about taking a camping trip
this weekend.

616
00:42:05.827 --> 00:42:10.005
- I was hoping I could see Lori
for dinner this Sunday.

617
00:42:10.136 --> 00:42:11.920
- I don't think so.

618
00:42:30.286 --> 00:42:32.767
Lifeguards
at Lake Sammamish

619
00:42:32.898 --> 00:42:35.117
rushed to the aid
of a woman drowning.

620
00:42:35.204 --> 00:42:37.859
but arrived too late
to save the mother of two

621
00:42:37.990 --> 00:42:41.080
swimming at the lake
with her husband and children.

622
00:42:41.167 --> 00:42:44.039
and what was supposed to be
a day of fun and recreation

623
00:42:44.170 --> 00:42:46.215
ended in tragedy.

624
00:42:46.302 --> 00:42:48.478
Cynthia Baumgartner-Roth
was later pronounced dead

625
00:42:48.609 --> 00:42:50.916
at King County
Memorial Hospital.

626
00:42:51.003 --> 00:42:52.657
Hundreds were gathered
at the lake.

627
00:42:52.744 --> 00:42:55.877
but few saw the tragic
event unfold...

628
00:42:59.489 --> 00:43:03.363
Sammamish County received a call
around 12:45

629
00:43:03.493 --> 00:43:05.931
stating a woman was unresponsive

630
00:43:06.061 --> 00:43:09.151
at a popular swimming spot.
Deputies and first responders

631
00:43:09.238 --> 00:43:11.284
went to the scene and began
efforts to save...

632
00:43:15.462 --> 00:43:19.727
Where she was later pronounced
dead on arrival.

633
00:43:36.178 --> 00:43:38.746
- We don't cry.

634
00:43:38.833 --> 00:43:41.227
We don't ever cry.

635
00:43:41.314 --> 00:43:44.752
It's over now.

636
00:43:44.839 --> 00:43:49.017
In the Marines. we were taught
to show no fear.

637
00:43:49.148 --> 00:43:52.630
We developed a healthy
short-term memory.

638
00:43:57.156 --> 00:43:58.984
I'm going to teach you.

639
00:43:59.114 --> 00:44:01.639
Okay?

640
00:44:01.726 --> 00:44:03.336
You'll be fine.

641
00:44:07.819 --> 00:44:09.995
Good.

642
00:44:10.082 --> 00:44:11.170
Now. eat up.

643
00:44:38.153 --> 00:44:40.503
- I heard on the radio.
It's uh...

644
00:44:40.634 --> 00:44:44.029
I couldn't believe it.

645
00:44:44.159 --> 00:44:46.422
Is it true?

646
00:44:46.553 --> 00:44:48.947
- It was her idea to go out
to the lake.

647
00:44:49.077 --> 00:44:51.253
- What happened?

648
00:44:51.384 --> 00:44:53.168
- Boys were playing
on the beach.

649
00:44:53.255 --> 00:44:57.129
and she asked if we could
take the raft out.

650
00:44:57.259 --> 00:44:59.261
Thought it'd be romantic.
just the two of us.

651
00:44:59.348 --> 00:45:00.741
Speed boat went by...

652
00:45:00.872 --> 00:45:03.265
and we went over.
I was climbing back on...

653
00:45:03.352 --> 00:45:06.399
She said something
about a cramp...

654
00:45:06.486 --> 00:45:09.445
I looked over...
she was gone.

655
00:45:09.532 --> 00:45:12.361
- Is Tyson okay? Can I see?

656
00:45:12.448 --> 00:45:14.842
- We watched a movie.
He's asleep.

657
00:45:14.973 --> 00:45:16.670
I don't want to wake him.

658
00:45:16.801 --> 00:45:18.933
Is there anything else?

659
00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:21.849
- I don't believe it.

660
00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:24.547
- Goodnight. Lori.

661
00:45:28.421 --> 00:45:30.728
- I don't believe you!

662
00:46:08.330 --> 00:46:11.507
He's...
he's so charming.

663
00:46:11.594 --> 00:46:15.903
Like. this just feels right.
I feel like he's the one.

664
00:46:16.034 --> 00:46:18.166
He's keeping
his dead wife's ashes

665
00:46:18.253 --> 00:46:20.516
in a plastic bag
in the basement!

666
00:46:20.603 --> 00:46:22.344
- Randy Roth's residence.

667
00:46:22.431 --> 00:46:24.172
You know what to do.

668
00:46:27.654 --> 00:46:28.960
You're a good
friend. Lori...

669
00:46:31.745 --> 00:46:35.227
I'm gonna be here
for you and Tyson.

670
00:46:35.357 --> 00:46:39.013
Listen. I promise you...
I always will be.

671
00:46:39.144 --> 00:46:41.450
I always got you.
right?

672
00:46:41.537 --> 00:46:43.104
You bet. kid.

673
00:47:39.595 --> 00:47:41.771
- Hey!
- Don't hurt me!

674
00:47:41.902 --> 00:47:43.861
- Who are you?
What are you doing here?

675
00:47:43.948 --> 00:47:46.341
- I just... I needed
to talk to you.

676
00:47:46.428 --> 00:47:48.604
I would have come sooner. but...

677
00:47:48.691 --> 00:47:52.391
I hadn't worked up
the courage yet.

678
00:47:52.478 --> 00:47:54.697
Can I bring my cat inside?

679
00:47:57.396 --> 00:47:59.224
- Yeah. sure.

680
00:48:02.967 --> 00:48:05.926
- My name is Donna Clift.

681
00:48:06.057 --> 00:48:07.667
- I'm Lori.

682
00:48:07.797 --> 00:48:11.105
- You're the friend
of that woman who drowned.

683
00:48:11.192 --> 00:48:13.281
- Did you know Cindy?

684
00:48:13.368 --> 00:48:14.413
- No.

685
00:48:18.808 --> 00:48:21.072
His name is Minx.

686
00:48:21.159 --> 00:48:23.596
I got him after me and Randy
divorced.

687
00:48:23.683 --> 00:48:27.513
I needed him after everything
that happened...

688
00:48:27.643 --> 00:48:30.429
Randy tried to drown me.
I should have said something!

689
00:48:30.516 --> 00:48:31.952
Or done something.

690
00:48:32.039 --> 00:48:33.736
I'm so sorry your friend--

691
00:48:33.823 --> 00:48:37.871
- Wait. wait... hold on.
Wait. please.

692
00:48:37.958 --> 00:48:41.353
Can you please just start
from the beginning?

693
00:48:43.268 --> 00:48:47.011
- I was a divorcee.

694
00:48:47.098 --> 00:48:49.404
I met Randy at a grocery store.

695
00:48:49.491 --> 00:48:53.365
It was actually that little boy
of his who asked me out.

696
00:48:53.495 --> 00:48:55.845
It was so cute.

697
00:48:55.976 --> 00:48:58.109
We were married
a few months later.

698
00:48:58.196 --> 00:49:02.287
I wanted to get swept up.
like some fairy tale princess.

699
00:49:03.723 --> 00:49:06.204
Pretty stupid. right?

700
00:49:06.334 --> 00:49:09.903
- Not at all.
- The moment we got married...

701
00:49:10.034 --> 00:49:12.645
the charm was gone.

702
00:49:12.732 --> 00:49:16.083
The want of me... was gone.

703
00:49:16.170 --> 00:49:19.434
Then we went on this white-water
rafting trip.

704
00:49:19.521 --> 00:49:21.784
We were on our own raft.
My parents were ahead of us.

705
00:49:21.871 --> 00:49:24.265
They rounded this bend
in the river...

706
00:49:24.352 --> 00:49:26.572
Then he got this look
in his eyes.

707
00:49:26.659 --> 00:49:28.182
like he was analyzing me.

708
00:49:28.269 --> 00:49:29.836
I could never forget it.

709
00:49:29.923 --> 00:49:32.970
And then he... slammed our raft
into these rocks.

710
00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.972
The raft flooded.
we were sinking

711
00:49:35.059 --> 00:49:37.931
and I didn't have a vest on
and I can barely swim.

712
00:49:38.018 --> 00:49:40.586
My dad got there just in time.

713
00:49:40.673 --> 00:49:43.110
He pulled me out of the water.

714
00:49:43.197 --> 00:49:48.028
Randy apologized.
said it was an accident.

715
00:49:48.115 --> 00:49:52.032
But I swear he wanted
to kill me.

716
00:49:52.119 --> 00:49:54.252
- Why didn't you call
the police?

717
00:49:54.382 --> 00:49:56.210
- And say what?

718
00:49:56.341 --> 00:49:57.951
That my husband purposely
tried to drown me

719
00:49:58.082 --> 00:49:59.822
for no reason whatsoever?

720
00:49:59.909 --> 00:50:02.216
My own parents
didn't even believe me!

721
00:50:04.697 --> 00:50:07.526
- Okay. well. why now?
Why call me?

722
00:50:07.656 --> 00:50:11.008
- I needed to tell somebody.
Because...

723
00:50:13.358 --> 00:50:15.186
Because I know
he'll do it again.

724
00:50:36.163 --> 00:50:37.904
- Boys. get in here!

725
00:50:46.130 --> 00:50:48.915
So you two don't want
to respect the rules.

726
00:50:49.002 --> 00:50:52.875
I was gonna clean it after...

727
00:50:52.962 --> 00:50:55.313
- What were you gonna say?
Come here.

728
00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.184
On the line!

729
00:50:57.271 --> 00:51:00.927
You stay right there.
What do you say?

730
00:51:01.058 --> 00:51:02.929
"Yes. sir!"

731
00:51:03.060 --> 00:51:05.149
- Yes. sir.

732
00:51:05.236 --> 00:51:07.586
- Yes. sir.

733
00:51:07.716 --> 00:51:11.372
- You know. it's a good thing
I'm here.

734
00:51:11.459 --> 00:51:14.593
Because I need to teach you...

735
00:51:24.168 --> 00:51:27.867
Down on your knees.

736
00:51:27.954 --> 00:51:30.174
Down on your knees! Now!

737
00:51:30.304 --> 00:51:31.784
Clean this up.

738
00:51:31.871 --> 00:51:33.786
I want this floor so clean

739
00:51:33.873 --> 00:51:35.309
that you can eat off of it!

740
00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:36.789
You hear me?

741
00:51:36.876 --> 00:51:38.617
- Yes. sir.
- Yes. sir.

742
00:51:44.579 --> 00:51:45.754
- Argh!
- You hear me?

743
00:51:47.887 --> 00:51:50.411
I want this floor spotless.

744
00:51:50.498 --> 00:51:52.457
Do you understand?
- Yes. sir.

745
00:51:52.544 --> 00:51:54.241
- Yes. sir.

746
00:51:54.372 --> 00:51:55.634
- You should know better.

747
00:52:05.644 --> 00:52:08.342
- Miss Baker? Miss Baker.
thanks for your patience.

748
00:52:08.429 --> 00:52:11.519
How can I help you?

749
00:52:11.650 --> 00:52:13.739
- And she swears Randy
tried to kill her.

750
00:52:13.826 --> 00:52:15.828
- And Donna Clift.
she'd be willing

751
00:52:15.958 --> 00:52:17.656
to speak with us
about this?

752
00:52:17.786 --> 00:52:20.180
- She's scared.
but she wants to help.

753
00:52:20.267 --> 00:52:22.922
- Okay. But you should know
the medical examiner

754
00:52:23.052 --> 00:52:24.750
listed Cindy's death
as an accidental drowning.

755
00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.143
- You don't know Randy.

756
00:52:26.230 --> 00:52:27.970
I saw him the night
of Cindy's death.

757
00:52:28.057 --> 00:52:29.885
He was totally unemotional.

758
00:52:30.016 --> 00:52:31.713
- People grieve in a lot
of different ways.

759
00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.455
- This wasn't shock. and Tyson
is still living with him.

760
00:52:34.542 --> 00:52:36.370
I have to get him
out of there.

761
00:52:36.457 --> 00:52:38.677
- You'd prefer
he'd live with you?

762
00:52:38.764 --> 00:52:42.071
- As opposed to a murderer?

763
00:52:42.202 --> 00:52:45.031
He's not safe there!
- Miss Baker...

764
00:52:45.118 --> 00:52:47.599
King County looks into
every accidental death

765
00:52:47.686 --> 00:52:49.644
to see if there are
suspicious circumstances.

766
00:52:49.731 --> 00:52:51.733
In this case.
there are none.

767
00:52:51.864 --> 00:52:53.909
- What about his first wife.
Janis?

768
00:52:53.996 --> 00:52:57.086
Between her and Donna.
and now Cindy. come on!

769
00:52:57.174 --> 00:52:58.871
That is a pattern. right?

770
00:52:58.958 --> 00:53:00.655
- We'll look into it. ma'am.

771
00:53:10.535 --> 00:53:13.799
- I'm really sorry.
I wish we could do more.

772
00:53:13.886 --> 00:53:17.194
- I told Cindy. I promised her

773
00:53:17.281 --> 00:53:21.198
that I would take care
of her and Tyson.

774
00:53:21.285 --> 00:53:22.895
And I failed her.

775
00:53:25.332 --> 00:53:29.423
But I'm not going
to fail her son.

776
00:53:29.554 --> 00:53:33.166
- Look. custody usually goes
to the other parent.

777
00:53:33.297 --> 00:53:36.125
but since Cindy and Randy
only just got married.

778
00:53:36.213 --> 00:53:38.954
I'd check and see
if there's a preexisting will.

779
00:53:39.041 --> 00:53:42.088
Maybe Cindy listed a grandparent
or someone else

780
00:53:42.175 --> 00:53:44.743
to take in her kid.
That's what I would do.

781
00:53:47.615 --> 00:53:49.965
- Thank you. Detective Peters.

782
00:53:50.052 --> 00:53:54.622
- Soupie. It's Sue Peters.
Soupie.

783
00:53:54.709 --> 00:53:58.017
- Soupie.

784
00:53:58.104 --> 00:53:59.801
Soupie. please...

785
00:53:59.932 --> 00:54:02.326
Look into Janis's death.

786
00:54:02.456 --> 00:54:03.718
Can you do that?

787
00:55:02.864 --> 00:55:06.128
- See anything you like?

788
00:55:06.215 --> 00:55:09.480
Take whatever you want.
It's just garbage.

789
00:55:09.610 --> 00:55:11.830
- I went by the bank today.

790
00:55:11.917 --> 00:55:15.007
Checked the safety deposit box
that Cindy and I shared.

791
00:55:15.094 --> 00:55:17.792
It was empty.

792
00:55:17.923 --> 00:55:20.926
- Lori!
- Hey!

793
00:55:21.056 --> 00:55:23.232
How are you doing?

794
00:55:23.363 --> 00:55:26.105
- Good.

795
00:55:26.235 --> 00:55:28.629
- Tell you what. why don't you.
uh... come inside?

796
00:55:28.716 --> 00:55:31.328
We're excited to. uh...
see an old friend.

797
00:55:50.912 --> 00:55:52.349
Would you like a cookie?

798
00:56:00.487 --> 00:56:02.010
- There you go. ma'am.

799
00:56:05.274 --> 00:56:07.233
- That's it. boys. You can go
do your homework with Dana.

800
00:56:12.412 --> 00:56:13.674
Now...

801
00:56:16.590 --> 00:56:19.680
What's all this about a safety
deposit box?

802
00:56:19.811 --> 00:56:21.508
- I checked the registry.

803
00:56:21.595 --> 00:56:23.728
You were the last one
to sign it out.

804
00:56:23.858 --> 00:56:27.035
- Cindy's my wife.
Or... she was.

805
00:56:27.122 --> 00:56:30.474
So anything that belongs
to her...

806
00:56:30.604 --> 00:56:31.736
...now belongs to me.

807
00:56:31.866 --> 00:56:33.433
- There was a will in there

808
00:56:33.564 --> 00:56:35.174
and I know Cindy
would have made sure

809
00:56:35.261 --> 00:56:36.567
that Tyson was taken care of.

810
00:56:36.654 --> 00:56:38.177
- And he is.

811
00:56:38.307 --> 00:56:40.788
- I want Tyson back.

812
00:56:40.919 --> 00:56:43.138
- Well. that's interesting
because...

813
00:56:43.269 --> 00:56:46.011
I never thought he was yours
to begin with.

814
00:56:46.098 --> 00:56:48.927
- I've known him
since the day he was born.

815
00:56:49.014 --> 00:56:50.581
I'm practically his mother!

816
00:56:50.668 --> 00:56:52.365
- But you're not. Lori.

817
00:56:52.452 --> 00:56:55.586
You're not his mother.
You're not his family.

818
00:57:00.199 --> 00:57:02.027
- When you look at me...

819
00:57:02.114 --> 00:57:05.639
you just see
a lonely woman. huh?

820
00:57:05.726 --> 00:57:07.336
But I'm not alone.

821
00:57:07.424 --> 00:57:09.991
And Cindy wasn't the only one
you've done this to.

822
00:57:10.122 --> 00:57:11.297
- Is that right?

823
00:57:19.044 --> 00:57:21.263
So who you've been talking to.
Lori?

824
00:57:23.962 --> 00:57:27.226
Who has Lori been talking to?

825
00:57:27.313 --> 00:57:30.838
- I'm not afraid of you.

826
00:57:30.925 --> 00:57:32.274
- Get out of my house.

827
00:57:44.112 --> 00:57:46.463
- Lori!

828
00:57:46.593 --> 00:57:49.814
Please don't go.
- Oh. sweetheart.

829
00:57:49.901 --> 00:57:53.513
I'm so sorry. Listen...
listen to me. Listen. okay?

830
00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:56.037
I am gonna come back
for you. okay?

831
00:57:56.168 --> 00:57:58.300
- Please don't leave.
- I promise you...

832
00:57:58.387 --> 00:58:01.129
that I'm gonna come back. okay?

833
00:58:01.216 --> 00:58:04.698
- Please don't leave...
- Listen. listen to me. okay?

834
00:58:04.829 --> 00:58:08.136
I promise. okay?
I'm gonna come back for you.

835
00:58:08.267 --> 00:58:11.662
- Please don't leave.
- Tyson!

836
00:58:15.535 --> 00:58:17.189
- It's okay...

837
00:58:17.276 --> 00:58:20.975
- Don't make me say it again.
Tyson.

838
00:58:21.106 --> 00:58:22.368
- You're doing okay.

839
00:58:28.722 --> 00:58:32.160
- Let's go. boys.

840
00:58:32.247 --> 00:58:34.989
Oh. and I might just go
have a word with your friend.

841
00:58:48.176 --> 00:58:49.743
- Just where do you think
you're going. young lady?

842
00:58:49.830 --> 00:58:51.963
- I'm just going to Randy's. I
don't get what the big deal is.

843
00:58:52.093 --> 00:58:53.660
- The big deal is your mother
said you're grounded.

844
00:58:53.747 --> 00:58:55.923
- She's not my mother.
Randy lost his wife;

845
00:58:56.010 --> 00:58:57.969
Greg and Tyson
lost their mom.

846
00:58:58.099 --> 00:59:01.320
They need me.
- You get back here right now.

847
00:59:03.322 --> 00:59:04.584
Get back here right now!

848
00:59:04.715 --> 00:59:06.064
- I don't know
what your problem is.

849
00:59:06.194 --> 00:59:08.457
He's your friend!
- John!

850
00:59:08.588 --> 00:59:11.591
- Stop!
- Let go! You're hurting me!

851
00:59:11.678 --> 00:59:15.290
- John. stop! Stop. please!
We can't! We can't!

852
00:59:15.377 --> 00:59:20.078
Please! Please.

853
00:59:20.165 --> 00:59:22.080
Oh. my God!

854
00:59:43.928 --> 00:59:47.366
- Hey... thanks for meeting me
halfway.

855
00:59:47.453 --> 00:59:49.847
- As soon as you said
the name Randy Roth...

856
00:59:49.977 --> 00:59:51.588
I got my keys.

857
00:59:51.718 --> 00:59:53.590
- So you remember the case
pretty well?

858
00:59:55.896 --> 00:59:57.463
- I'll never forget that one.

859
01:00:00.422 --> 01:00:01.772
- Minx!

860
01:00:01.859 --> 01:00:03.208
Psst. psst!

861
01:00:03.295 --> 01:00:05.340
Minx?

862
01:00:05.427 --> 01:00:07.125
Minxie cat!

863
01:00:09.257 --> 01:00:11.303
Samantha. have you seen Minx?

864
01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:14.567
- No. Mom!

865
01:00:14.698 --> 01:00:16.308
- Darned scaredy cat...

866
01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.969
- Everything here
points to an accident.

867
01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:27.449
- I never had a shred
of hard evidence.

868
01:00:27.536 --> 01:00:29.930
But his story kept on changing.

869
01:00:30.017 --> 01:00:33.760
Where she was. where he was.
how it happened.

870
01:00:33.891 --> 01:00:35.370
A couple of us went up
and walked the trail.

871
01:00:35.457 --> 01:00:38.069
Tried to recreate
how it happened.

872
01:00:38.156 --> 01:00:41.507
When you called and said
another wife had died...

873
01:00:41.594 --> 01:00:45.032
in an accident?

874
01:00:45.163 --> 01:00:47.339
Let's just say
I wasn't surprised.

875
01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:48.226
- There has to be something--
something you can do.

876
01:01:48.356 --> 01:01:50.619
- Janis' death is suspicious.

877
01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:53.448
but like Cindy. the official
reports point to an accident.

878
01:01:53.579 --> 01:01:55.842
Donna Clift
won't return my calls.

879
01:01:55.929 --> 01:01:58.279
And since Randy was legally
Cindy's husband.

880
01:01:58.366 --> 01:02:00.412
he had every right to remove
the personal items

881
01:02:00.542 --> 01:02:02.283
from the security deposit box.

882
01:02:02.370 --> 01:02:05.722
- But he's lying!
- Lori. it's not that simple.

883
01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:08.725
- Are you a real cop
or is that badge just for show?

884
01:02:13.947 --> 01:02:16.297
Look. I just...

885
01:02:16.384 --> 01:02:18.343
I need to get Tyson
out of there.

886
01:02:18.473 --> 01:02:21.085
- If he finds out that we're
investigating him for murder.

887
01:02:21.215 --> 01:02:24.610
he might destroy what little
evidence is still out there.

888
01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:27.134
- So... you do believe
that he did it?

889
01:02:27.221 --> 01:02:33.837
- Yes. but if I bring this case
to a DA now. they will kill it.

890
01:02:33.924 --> 01:02:36.796
Okay. look...
It's not over.

891
01:02:36.883 --> 01:02:39.538
We are checking county records
to see if Cindy filed

892
01:02:39.668 --> 01:02:42.367
a copy of the will
with the registrar's office.

893
01:02:42.497 --> 01:02:44.717
- And if she didn't?
- Well. then the only way

894
01:02:44.848 --> 01:02:47.981
to get Tyson away from Randy
will be to arrest him.

895
01:02:48.112 --> 01:02:53.160
which we cannot do
without more than just
circumstantial evidence.

896
01:03:05.956 --> 01:03:07.740
- John?

897
01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:09.655
John. honey?
- Ah...

898
01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:20.884
I'll go make some... lemonade?

899
01:03:23.930 --> 01:03:27.586
- I. uh... sorry about
your loss.

900
01:03:27.673 --> 01:03:33.374
- Thanks. Uh... but I'm not here
about Cindy.

901
01:03:33.461 --> 01:03:34.985
I'm here about Dana.

902
01:03:40.904 --> 01:03:42.993
- What about her?

903
01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:47.171
- I think that you're not
comfortable with Dana and Randy.

904
01:03:50.565 --> 01:03:53.655
- Nah. What about it?
I've known Randy for years.

905
01:03:53.742 --> 01:03:56.789
- And so that makes it okay
for him to spend

906
01:03:56.876 --> 01:03:59.183
that much time
with your teenage daughter?

907
01:04:03.013 --> 01:04:05.102
- And just what
are you insinuating?

908
01:04:05.232 --> 01:04:07.191
- Dana worships Randy.

909
01:04:07.321 --> 01:04:09.280
She's given herself
an eating disorder

910
01:04:09.367 --> 01:04:11.673
just to gain his approval.

911
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.327
- I don't even know
what you're talking--

912
01:04:13.458 --> 01:04:15.852
- There's something going on
here. and I think you see that.

913
01:04:15.982 --> 01:04:18.115
I mean. aren't you worried?

914
01:04:18.202 --> 01:04:20.334
Can't you see Randy
is grooming her to be some--

915
01:04:20.421 --> 01:04:22.119
- I'm her father!

916
01:04:22.249 --> 01:04:24.208
If anything inappropriate
was going on between Randy

917
01:04:24.295 --> 01:04:25.862
and my daughter. don't you think
I'd know about it?

918
01:04:25.949 --> 01:04:27.994
And don't you think
I'd put a stop to it?

919
01:04:32.694 --> 01:04:34.218
I think it's time
for you to leave.

920
01:04:38.048 --> 01:04:39.223
- Uh...

921
01:04:45.794 --> 01:04:47.579
- You're leaving already?

922
01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.888
Please
don't blame him!

923
01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:57.806
John's just...
he's just choosing

924
01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:01.027
to believe what he wants
to believe.

925
01:05:01.114 --> 01:05:03.987
- That his friend would never
betray him.

926
01:05:15.128 --> 01:05:19.698
Dana couldn't stand me
when I first moved in.

927
01:05:19.828 --> 01:05:22.962
And Randy was the only one
who could keep the peace.

928
01:05:23.049 --> 01:05:28.054
So if there's anyone
to blame. it's me.

929
01:05:28.141 --> 01:05:31.928
- There is someone to blame.
and it is not you. or Dana.

930
01:05:32.015 --> 01:05:34.800
- She thinks she loves him.

931
01:05:34.887 --> 01:05:40.197
So. if... if we demand
that she stops seeing him.

932
01:05:40.327 --> 01:05:43.374
it will send her running
straight into his arms.

933
01:05:43.504 --> 01:05:45.419
I don't know what to do.

934
01:05:45.506 --> 01:05:47.117
- Then help me.

935
01:05:47.247 --> 01:05:50.598
Help me prove
that Randy's dangerous.

936
01:05:50.729 --> 01:05:55.342
Help me get Tyson and Dana
and Greg away from him for good.

937
01:05:55.429 --> 01:05:57.866
- I... I... I don't know
anything.

938
01:05:57.997 --> 01:05:59.477
- Yes. you do.

939
01:05:59.564 --> 01:06:01.914
You've known him for years.

940
01:06:02.001 --> 01:06:05.962
All those women...
all those lies...

941
01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:07.659
Just tell me what you know.

942
01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:14.405
There was a...
there was a fiancée.

943
01:06:14.492 --> 01:06:16.973
She was... she was just like
the others.

944
01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:21.151
Pretty. blonde.
Widowed. with kids.

945
01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:23.936
Single mom. lonely.
Just like Cindy.

946
01:06:24.023 --> 01:06:27.113
They were always like that.

947
01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.463
They thought they were getting
this charming husband

948
01:06:29.594 --> 01:06:33.119
and amazing father. but...
that's not what they got.

949
01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:36.644
Not at all.

950
01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:40.909
It was southern.
like Mary Jane or...

951
01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:43.521
Mary Jo. Yeah.
Mary Jo Philips.

952
01:07:13.246 --> 01:07:15.553
- Come on. gang! Let's go!
We're late for school!

953
01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:18.077
- Mary Jo Philips?
- Yep.

954
01:07:18.164 --> 01:07:20.862
Come on gang. let's go.
Let's go!

955
01:07:20.949 --> 01:07:23.952
- I'm Lori Baker. I was hoping
to speak with you about--

956
01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.867
- Sorry. I don't have time
for whatever you're selling.

957
01:07:25.954 --> 01:07:28.479
- I'm here about Randy Roth.

958
01:07:28.566 --> 01:07:30.394
You two were engaged. right?

959
01:07:30.524 --> 01:07:33.179
Was it his son who first asked
you out on a date with his dad?

960
01:07:40.273 --> 01:07:45.539
- He was... charming.
Thoughtful.

961
01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:48.455
He pursued me aggressively and
as a single mom with two kids.

962
01:07:48.542 --> 01:07:50.457
that felt really good.

963
01:07:50.544 --> 01:07:52.807
Honestly. the relationship
was amazing until...

964
01:07:52.938 --> 01:07:55.462
- Until what?

965
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:58.204
- He asked me
about life insurance...

966
01:07:58.335 --> 01:08:01.816
His first wife had died
in an accident and...

967
01:08:01.903 --> 01:08:03.514
he wanted to make sure
the kids were taken care of

968
01:08:03.644 --> 01:08:04.950
no matter what. but...

969
01:08:07.170 --> 01:08:09.824
...I'd had ovarian cancer.

970
01:08:09.955 --> 01:08:12.784
I'm uninsurable.

971
01:08:12.914 --> 01:08:16.135
It was after that
that he grew distant.

972
01:08:16.221 --> 01:08:19.573
I... thought maybe the fear
of marrying another woman

973
01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:22.184
he might lose
that drove him away.

974
01:08:22.272 --> 01:08:26.232
We broke it off
within the month.

975
01:08:26.362 --> 01:08:30.280
- It wasn't the threat of cancer
that drove Randy away.

976
01:08:30.367 --> 01:08:34.414
And Randy's first wife
did not die in an accident.

977
01:08:34.501 --> 01:08:36.199
Neither did my friend.

978
01:08:36.328 --> 01:08:39.898
- So Randy was...

979
01:08:39.985 --> 01:08:43.119
If I had been insurable.
he was going to...

980
01:08:49.647 --> 01:08:52.476
Okay. What can I do?

981
01:08:54.608 --> 01:08:56.131
- Camping is gonna be
so much fun.

982
01:08:56.219 --> 01:08:59.091
- Right? I love making s'mores.

983
01:08:59.178 --> 01:09:03.050
I mean. a nutritious
vegetable sampler...

984
01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:05.140
- Where are we going
camping again?

985
01:09:05.228 --> 01:09:08.056
- Olympia national forest.
- Is it true...

986
01:09:08.187 --> 01:09:10.494
that there are ghost bears
in that forest?

987
01:09:10.581 --> 01:09:12.931
- Maybe!
- Are you afraid of ghost bears?

988
01:09:13.060 --> 01:09:14.889
- No...
- Don't worry.

989
01:09:14.976 --> 01:09:16.717
Dad will beat them up
if they come into our tent.

990
01:09:16.804 --> 01:09:18.502
Isn't that right. Dad?
- You bet. sport!

991
01:09:26.249 --> 01:09:27.772
Dana. would you mind finishing
loading up the truck?

992
01:09:27.902 --> 01:09:30.557
We'll be right back.

993
01:09:30.644 --> 01:09:31.862
Thanks.

994
01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.737
- Hey. ma'am. uh... you're...
you're really pretty.

995
01:09:36.824 --> 01:09:38.565
You wanna go on a date
with my dad?

996
01:09:38.652 --> 01:09:40.001
- Greg.

997
01:09:40.131 --> 01:09:42.830
Sorry. my son's very forward.

998
01:09:42.916 --> 01:09:45.354
Here. let me help you
with that. Greg?
- Oh. thank you.

999
01:09:45.442 --> 01:09:49.140
- I'm Randy. Randy Roth.
- Stacey. Nice to meet you.

1000
01:09:49.228 --> 01:09:51.883
- Nice to meet you. too.
- My car's over here.

1001
01:09:52.013 --> 01:09:54.364
Thanks so much.

1002
01:09:54.451 --> 01:09:56.409
- You're welcome.
- What's your name?

1003
01:09:56.496 --> 01:09:58.063
- Greg. Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1004
01:09:58.150 --> 01:10:00.108
I have a son too.
His name's Liam.

1005
01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:02.589
- Liam?

1006
01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:19.040
- Soupie. I was about
to call you.

1007
01:10:19.127 --> 01:10:21.521
- You were right.
It's the insurance.

1008
01:10:21.608 --> 01:10:23.784
Randy updated
the policy on Cindy

1009
01:10:23.871 --> 01:10:25.786
before the ink on the marriage
certificate was even dry.

1010
01:10:25.873 --> 01:10:28.441
Same thing with Janis.

1011
01:10:28.572 --> 01:10:32.924
- So this is--
- This is good. It's motive.

1012
01:10:33.011 --> 01:10:34.882
But it's not why I'm here.

1013
01:10:34.969 --> 01:10:36.841
- What is this?

1014
01:10:36.971 --> 01:10:38.234
- It's Cindy's will.

1015
01:10:38.364 --> 01:10:40.236
She registered it
with the county.

1016
01:10:40.323 --> 01:10:43.369
- What does it say?
- I think you should read it.

1017
01:11:00.255 --> 01:11:02.083
In the event
of my death.

1018
01:11:02.214 --> 01:11:05.348
I. Cynthia Baumgartner.
leave all my worldly possessions

1019
01:11:05.434 --> 01:11:07.698
to my son Tyson Baumgartner.

1020
01:11:07.827 --> 01:11:10.483
If he is not of legal
guardianship age.

1021
01:11:10.570 --> 01:11:13.050
I ask that he be put
in the custody

1022
01:11:13.138 --> 01:11:15.619
of my good friend. Lori Baker.

1023
01:11:15.706 --> 01:11:18.577
Lori hasn't just been
like family to us...

1024
01:11:18.665 --> 01:11:20.972
Lori is our family.

1025
01:11:21.059 --> 01:11:25.193
As such. I designate Lori to be
the sole executor of my estate.

1026
01:11:25.324 --> 01:11:27.718
managing all of my assets.
possessions

1027
01:11:27.805 --> 01:11:29.763
and any insurance compensations.

1028
01:11:29.894 --> 01:11:33.985
which are to be put in a trust
until my son is of age.

1029
01:11:41.601 --> 01:11:44.603
- Get the hell off my property!
- I'm here for Tyson.

1030
01:11:44.691 --> 01:11:46.998
- He's my boy now.
- My lawyer called yours.

1031
01:11:47.085 --> 01:11:49.348
This is not a negotiation.
He's coming with me--

1032
01:11:49.478 --> 01:11:52.656
- He needs discipline!
He's staying here with me.
- Let's go. honey.

1033
01:11:52.743 --> 01:11:54.919
Tyson's coming with me
and he's never coming back here.

1034
01:11:55.049 --> 01:11:57.182
Come on. honey. let's go.
- Tyson. get in the house!

1035
01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:59.184
- It's okay.
- He's not going anywhere.

1036
01:11:59.271 --> 01:12:02.230
- Move aside. Randy!

1037
01:12:02.318 --> 01:12:04.145
- You're gonna make me?

1038
01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:11.196
- How about we call the police
and we get them here instead?

1039
01:12:13.677 --> 01:12:15.026
- Tyson. come here.

1040
01:12:25.689 --> 01:12:27.386
- Do you wanna go with her?

1041
01:12:27.517 --> 01:12:29.344
Or do you wanna stay here
with your family?

1042
01:12:33.871 --> 01:12:35.481
- I wanna go.

1043
01:12:37.309 --> 01:12:39.355
- Come here. sweetheart.

1044
01:12:45.535 --> 01:12:47.754
Let's get in the car. okay?

1045
01:12:47.841 --> 01:12:49.843
- Get out of here
before I change my mind!

1046
01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:35.367
- Yes. Detective?
- Ma'am. I was wondering

1047
01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:37.804
if you had a chance to look over
the files I sent you?

1048
01:13:37.934 --> 01:13:39.589
On Randy Roth?

1049
01:13:42.505 --> 01:13:43.767
- Have a seat. Detective.

1050
01:13:54.865 --> 01:13:58.477
So what do the detectives
in your division call my office?

1051
01:13:58.564 --> 01:14:04.875
- Special Operations Unit
of the Deputy Prosecutor
for King County.

1052
01:14:04.962 --> 01:14:07.965
The office of last resort.
ma'am.

1053
01:14:08.094 --> 01:14:10.054
- And how many other prosecutors

1054
01:14:10.141 --> 01:14:13.361
did you take this case to first?
- Quite a few.

1055
01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:15.494
- And do you know why
they didn't take your case?

1056
01:14:15.625 --> 01:14:18.192
- Well. the evidence is...
- Nonexistent.

1057
01:14:18.279 --> 01:14:20.891
Circumstantial at best.
- Yes. ma'am.

1058
01:14:20.978 --> 01:14:23.327
- Yes.

1059
01:14:23.415 --> 01:14:26.374
But that's not why
they turned down your case.

1060
01:14:26.505 --> 01:14:31.510
They turned it down
because they have no balls.

1061
01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:33.512
I read your file...

1062
01:14:33.643 --> 01:14:36.602
Randy Roth is
a cold-blooded killer.

1063
01:14:36.733 --> 01:14:39.736
he stalks his prey
and baits them with a smile.

1064
01:14:39.823 --> 01:14:42.085
flowers. and a marriage
proposal.

1065
01:14:42.173 --> 01:14:44.480
And once he has them chained
to eternity.

1066
01:14:44.610 --> 01:14:46.438
he insures them
and kills them.

1067
01:14:46.525 --> 01:14:48.701
He steals from them
and their children.

1068
01:14:48.788 --> 01:14:51.748
- So? How do you want to proceed
with the evidence?

1069
01:14:51.878 --> 01:14:53.619
- Forget the evidence.

1070
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:55.839
He's too smart.
We'll never get him that way.

1071
01:14:58.494 --> 01:15:00.191
No.

1072
01:15:00.278 --> 01:15:06.414
No. we get this guy
by making him think he can win.

1073
01:15:06.545 --> 01:15:09.635
I will get you a warrant
to search his house.

1074
01:15:09.722 --> 01:15:12.812
You just find me enough
that we can hang him
with his own lies.

1075
01:15:12.898 --> 01:15:14.597
We catch him in enough lies...

1076
01:15:14.684 --> 01:15:16.903
and he'll convince the jury
that he's a predator.

1077
01:15:16.990 --> 01:15:19.602
Hell...

1078
01:15:19.689 --> 01:15:22.866
we might even get a conviction.

1079
01:15:22.952 --> 01:15:24.607
- No. No. It's my turn now.

1080
01:15:24.693 --> 01:15:27.000
You are done talking. alright?
You listen to me.

1081
01:15:27.087 --> 01:15:29.568
I've got two kids.
a mortgage and a funeral.

1082
01:15:29.655 --> 01:15:32.049
I need that money now!
You hear me!

1083
01:15:32.136 --> 01:15:35.182
I don't care what some crap
piece of paper says.

1084
01:15:35.269 --> 01:15:38.621
I was her husband.
Her... her soulmate!

1085
01:15:38.708 --> 01:15:41.406
I need that money now!
It's mine!

1086
01:15:56.377 --> 01:15:57.553
- Randy?

1087
01:16:04.472 --> 01:16:07.214
What's happening?

1088
01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:08.693
- Take Greg
to your parents' house.

1089
01:16:08.781 --> 01:16:11.741
Don't say a word.
Not to anyone.

1090
01:16:11.827 --> 01:16:13.046
Go!

1091
01:16:28.018 --> 01:16:30.934
You're wasting your time.
- We'll see about that.

1092
01:16:37.941 --> 01:16:42.162
- Okay. guys... let's tear
this place apart!

1093
01:17:21.898 --> 01:17:24.596
- We've got nothing.

1094
01:17:24.683 --> 01:17:26.903
Nothing!

1095
01:17:34.693 --> 01:17:37.740
- Okay. guys.

1096
01:17:37.827 --> 01:17:39.871
Let's wrap it up and head home.

1097
01:17:39.959 --> 01:17:41.308
Thank you.

1098
01:17:46.879 --> 01:17:50.753
Hey... uh-uh!

1099
01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:53.755
We tried.

1100
01:17:53.843 --> 01:17:55.192
- Yeah.

1101
01:19:09.266 --> 01:19:12.486
- Please.

1102
01:19:12.573 --> 01:19:14.837
- Mr. Roth.

1103
01:19:14.924 --> 01:19:18.144
I do apologize for the way
that you've been treated.

1104
01:19:18.231 --> 01:19:19.929
There were inconsistencies

1105
01:19:20.059 --> 01:19:22.540
in what has officially been
reported as an accidental death

1106
01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:25.282
that led my colleagues
in the police department

1107
01:19:25.412 --> 01:19:26.892
to start looking for something

1108
01:19:26.978 --> 01:19:28.938
that most likely
doesn't even exist.

1109
01:19:29.025 --> 01:19:31.027
Certain people
may have overstepped.

1110
01:19:31.114 --> 01:19:32.505
- You think?

1111
01:19:32.637 --> 01:19:34.813
- I know. But if you could
just be so kind

1112
01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:36.815
to answer a few questions.

1113
01:19:36.902 --> 01:19:39.775
I believe that we can just clear
this matter up today.

1114
01:19:42.342 --> 01:19:43.952
- Certainly.

1115
01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:47.173
Whatever you ladies need.
- Thank you.

1116
01:19:52.264 --> 01:19:54.877
Dana?

1117
01:19:54.964 --> 01:19:58.576
- Someone's here to see you.

1118
01:19:58.706 --> 01:20:01.579
- Hey. Dana.
Hey. Greg.

1119
01:20:01.666 --> 01:20:03.668
- Greg. honey. why don't you
come with me?

1120
01:20:13.112 --> 01:20:15.245
- So. your previous
relationship.

1121
01:20:15.375 --> 01:20:16.942
with Mary Jo Philips.

1122
01:20:17.073 --> 01:20:19.771
Did that end organically?

1123
01:20:19.858 --> 01:20:22.773
- It just wasn't a good match.

1124
01:20:22.905 --> 01:20:25.864
She was really the one
who ended things.
- Okay.

1125
01:20:25.951 --> 01:20:28.171
But you were married
prior to that. correct?

1126
01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:31.522
To Donna Clift?
Why did that end?

1127
01:20:31.609 --> 01:20:35.004
- Donna's kid and my son Greg
just didn't get along.

1128
01:20:35.134 --> 01:20:37.571
Donna's a lovely woman.
but you know.

1129
01:20:37.702 --> 01:20:40.226
it just didn't make sense
to stay together.

1130
01:20:40.357 --> 01:20:42.446
Especially when there's
disharmony in the home.

1131
01:20:42.576 --> 01:20:45.449
- Oh yeah. I can imagine.

1132
01:20:45.579 --> 01:20:48.844
- I'm sorry to ask.
My brothers both served...

1133
01:20:48.974 --> 01:20:53.892
but we heard you were struggling
with some post-traumatic stress?

1134
01:20:54.023 --> 01:20:55.675
- Sometimes.

1135
01:20:58.766 --> 01:21:02.031
But that's the cross we bear
to protect this great country.

1136
01:21:04.947 --> 01:21:09.647
I just hope you ladies never
have to see those types
of things.

1137
01:21:09.734 --> 01:21:12.258
- Well. thank you
for your service.

1138
01:21:12.344 --> 01:21:14.434
- Yes. absolutely.

1139
01:21:14.521 --> 01:21:16.610
- He was in the Marines.

1140
01:21:16.697 --> 01:21:20.353
He was a file clerk
in North Carolina.

1141
01:21:20.484 --> 01:21:22.790
He was never in combat.

1142
01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.749
He never even left the country.

1143
01:21:30.842 --> 01:21:32.539
- Do you know what this is?

1144
01:21:34.585 --> 01:21:37.980
- A promise ring?

1145
01:21:38.067 --> 01:21:40.939
Randy promised me...

1146
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:43.333
he promised me
that he would marry me

1147
01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:45.422
as soon as I was old enough.

1148
01:21:45.509 --> 01:21:47.598
He told me he loved me!

1149
01:21:47.728 --> 01:21:49.817
- No...
- No. he promised me!

1150
01:21:49.948 --> 01:21:51.862
- Listen. Dana.
- He promised me...

1151
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:53.386
- You did nothing wrong.

1152
01:21:53.473 --> 01:21:54.779
Do you hear me? Nothing!

1153
01:21:58.914 --> 01:22:00.785
Oh. honey. it's going
to be okay.

1154
01:22:04.223 --> 01:22:07.923
- So. your relationship with
Cynthia. it was good then?

1155
01:22:08.053 --> 01:22:10.708
- Our marriage?
It was perfect.

1156
01:22:10.838 --> 01:22:13.318
- You and Cindy were
in the honeymoon phase still?

1157
01:22:13.406 --> 01:22:15.713
- Oh. for sure.
I was very happy.

1158
01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.496
And Cindy. she was...

1159
01:22:17.628 --> 01:22:21.980
Oh. she was ecstatic.
Over the moon.

1160
01:22:22.067 --> 01:22:24.287
Yeah. we were deeply in love
right up until...

1161
01:22:28.813 --> 01:22:30.119
I'm sorry...

1162
01:22:41.478 --> 01:22:43.959
- Mom. Dad...
- Come here. baby.

1163
01:22:46.526 --> 01:22:47.963
- I'm so sorry.

1164
01:22:55.448 --> 01:22:57.233
- Thank you.

1165
01:22:57.320 --> 01:22:59.975
- You'll take care of Greg?
- Of course.

1166
01:23:06.242 --> 01:23:08.460
- Mr. Roth. I would like
to read you a passage

1167
01:23:08.548 --> 01:23:10.159
from Cynthia's diary.

1168
01:23:16.513 --> 01:23:19.168
She made two entries
the day before she died.

1169
01:23:19.298 --> 01:23:21.996
And the first one. Mr. Roth...

1170
01:23:24.260 --> 01:23:25.696
...the first one is to you.

1171
01:23:29.264 --> 01:23:34.661
"Randy does not love Cindy.
Randy hates Cindy.

1172
01:23:34.748 --> 01:23:39.057
Randy hates Cindy's makeup.
her blonde hair.

1173
01:23:39.188 --> 01:23:42.626
He hates her cold fingers.
her ugly toes.

1174
01:23:42.713 --> 01:23:45.237
Randy hates the things
she wears.

1175
01:23:45.324 --> 01:23:48.240
and everywhere she goes.

1176
01:23:48.371 --> 01:23:51.200
He hates her favourite
colour. pink.

1177
01:23:51.287 --> 01:23:53.985
He hates to even
watch her drink.

1178
01:23:54.072 --> 01:23:56.901
He hates the way
she wakes from bed.

1179
01:23:56.987 --> 01:24:00.209
His every look
fills her with dread."

1180
01:24:04.648 --> 01:24:09.478
Now... That doesn't sound like
a woman who's "over the moon."

1181
01:24:09.566 --> 01:24:11.046
Does it?

1182
01:24:13.483 --> 01:24:15.180
- Mr. Roth.

1183
01:24:15.311 --> 01:24:17.878
Can you explain the nature
of your relationship

1184
01:24:17.965 --> 01:24:20.359
with your friend's daughter.
Dana Carlson?

1185
01:24:39.422 --> 01:24:41.815
- What are they doing here?

1186
01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:46.081
- They're here to make
their statements.

1187
01:24:51.434 --> 01:24:54.871
Let's get you back
to your cell.

1188
01:24:54.959 --> 01:24:56.439
Better get comfortable in there.

1189
01:25:20.724 --> 01:25:23.814
In this dream.
I never wake.

1190
01:25:23.943 --> 01:25:26.599
Tragedy now becomes my fate.

1191
01:25:26.730 --> 01:25:31.255
For I am with you always.
A mother's love never subsides.

1192
01:25:31.387 --> 01:25:35.652
I dream to hug you. kiss you.
touch you.

1193
01:25:35.739 --> 01:25:38.394
To hear your heartbeat
just once more.

1194
01:25:38.481 --> 01:25:41.745
Until we meet again. my child.

1195
01:25:41.832 --> 01:25:44.791
I love you forevermore.

1196
01:25:52.364 --> 01:25:53.844
- Is everything okay?

1197
01:25:56.499 --> 01:26:00.155
- I'd like to read you something
from your mom. Is that okay?

1198
01:26:15.126 --> 01:26:18.173
"To my beloved son. Tyson.

1199
01:26:18.260 --> 01:26:22.438
I have this dream.
I lie in sombre..."
