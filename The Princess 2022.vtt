00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.149
What?

4
00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.212
Come on. then.

5
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.923
Clear!

6
00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.633
See if she's in here.

7
00:02:56.802 --> 00:02:59.012
All right. come on. You're nearly there.

8
00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.975
Go on. then. Open it.

9
00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.987
-Right.
-Right.

10
00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:21.159
So. this is the princess.

11
00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:22.911
All pure for her wedding.

12
00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:25.831
I haven't been close
to the princess before.

13
00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:29.584
Yeah. there's a reason for that.

14
00:03:31.837 --> 00:03:33.630
No. don't.

15
00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.883
If you wake her up.
I'm gonna break your face.

16
00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:37.968
Yeah. yeah.

17
00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:45.684
Oh. here we go.

18
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.732
Got a little fight in you. eh?

19
00:03:52.482 --> 00:03:54.025
Just get her back to bed.

20
00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:57.070
-What's she doing?

21
00:04:21.386 --> 00:04:23.680
-Grab her.

22
00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:27.392
Whoa.

23
00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:29.060
Come on.

24
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.563
Yeah!

25
00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:35.025
You're gonna get married. like it or not.

26
00:04:39.321 --> 00:04:40.989
Stop messing around.

27
00:04:41.865 --> 00:04:43.283
Get her back in bed.

28
00:05:02.385 --> 00:05:03.386
All right.

29
00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:05.680
Fun's over.

30
00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.766
Get back here!

31
00:05:13.146 --> 00:05:14.564
Come here. you little bitch.

32
00:05:29.913 --> 00:05:30.997
I've got you now.

33
00:06:27.095 --> 00:06:30.181
You think you're gonna make it
all the way to the bottom?

34
00:06:32.684 --> 00:06:33.935
I'll see you there.

35
00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.826
Might be in here.
Looks like she might be in here.

36
00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.038
-I can hear something.
-No.

37
00:06:53.622 --> 00:06:55.290
What's going on in there?

38
00:07:55.934 --> 00:07:57.477
All right! This way!

39
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.895
-Get moving!

40
00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.272
On your knees.

41
00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.399
Close those doors!

42
00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:47.068
-Quiet. On the floor.
-Lock everything down.

43
00:08:47.152 --> 00:08:48.153
Shut up.

44
00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:50.780
-Get this off the floor.
-Sit!

45
00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:54.701
Get that lock in place!

46
00:08:55.326 --> 00:08:57.495
Come on! Close the door.

47
00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.664
No one gets in or out!

48
00:09:00.874 --> 00:09:01.958
-Quickly!
-Move!

49
00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.418
Lock it down!

50
00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:04.919
What are you looking at?

51
00:09:05.587 --> 00:09:07.422
-Come on! Move it!
-On the floor.

52
00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.674
Castle is secure. sir.

53
00:09:09.758 --> 00:09:11.509
Get down. now!

54
00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.928
Told ya. move! Come along!

55
00:09:25.106 --> 00:09:26.483
I hoped it wouldn't come to this.

56
00:09:26.566 --> 00:09:28.568
I don't believe that for a moment.

57
00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:31.571
Julius. if your father could see--

58
00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:32.655
My father?

59
00:09:33.656 --> 00:09:34.949
My father?

60
00:09:35.033 --> 00:09:37.035
Your father was a diplomat.

61
00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.829
You two were cut from the same cloth.

62
00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.457
Weak.

63
00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.167
Pathetic.

64
00:09:44.250 --> 00:09:46.878
-Pacifiers. placaters.
-We trusted you.

65
00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:48.588
You talk to me about trust?

66
00:09:48.671 --> 00:09:50.381
You can't have my sister.

67
00:09:52.383 --> 00:09:54.260
Well. my little princess.

68
00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:59.682
I will marry your sister
because I always get what I want.

69
00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.944
Listen and obey.

70
00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:14.155
Like a child should.

71
00:10:19.244 --> 00:10:20.495
Now. now.

72
00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:24.916
We shouldn't be surprised
that this so-called king

73
00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.419
abides the bad behavior of his daughters.

74
00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:33.091
You have no respect
for the order of things.

75
00:10:33.174 --> 00:10:35.301
You have trampled
our cherished traditions.

76
00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:37.303
You have welcomed outsiders.

77
00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.598
A true king should've conquered them.

78
00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:45.270
You have made us look vulnerable
in the eyes of our enemy.

79
00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:48.731
Julius. listen to me.
No one can rule by fear for long.

80
00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:52.193
The people are not cattle.
They will not follow you blindly.

81
00:10:52.277 --> 00:10:53.653
Oh. "the people."

82
00:10:55.155 --> 00:10:58.366
People don't know what they want
until they see it.

83
00:10:58.449 --> 00:11:01.828
Strength on the throne.
that is what "the people" crave.

84
00:11:02.745 --> 00:11:05.707
Today. they shall have it.

85
00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:10.003
As you were.

86
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.672
You. get them. Move!

87
00:11:12.755 --> 00:11:15.550
-All right. come.
-Come on! Get on your feet.

88
00:11:15.633 --> 00:11:16.843
-Come on. Get up.
-Come on.

89
00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:20.388
-Chop-chop. Come on.
-Come on. move! Move it!

90
00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:22.932
This is all my fault.

91
00:11:36.654 --> 00:11:38.698
You are old enough now to understand.

92
00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:41.367
This kingdom. it has no heir.

93
00:11:42.035 --> 00:11:44.370
You will find it in yourself
to do your duty.

94
00:11:56.549 --> 00:12:01.888
I am so honored
that you have chosen me as your son.

95
00:12:02.722 --> 00:12:05.767
And to be given the vast responsibility

96
00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:07.936
of becoming the true leader
of this kingdom.

97
00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:18.071
I'd like to offer you this small token.

98
00:12:27.121 --> 00:12:28.122
I…

99
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.668
I'm s-- I'm sorry.

100
00:12:54.148 --> 00:12:56.693
Hang on. I gotta take a piss.

101
00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:20.800
Oh. yeah.

102
00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:25.847
Mm-hmm.

103
00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:43.906
Huh?

104
00:13:44.866 --> 00:13:46.242
Well. what do we have here?

105
00:13:48.786 --> 00:13:51.539
Yeah. looking good.

106
00:13:57.211 --> 00:13:58.296
Oh. yeah.

107
00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:52.141
All right. then.

108
00:14:54.977 --> 00:14:57.480
Where are you at? Get in here. now.

109
00:15:04.779 --> 00:15:07.407
-Oi. get that door now! Move!
-Go!

110
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.492
Get a bag to put it in!

111
00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.869
-Search every room!

112
00:15:16.332 --> 00:15:17.875
Oi. come over here.

113
00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:22.547
Plenty of bounty in here. boys.

114
00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:25.550
Come on! This way!

115
00:15:27.552 --> 00:15:29.429
Pick it up. Come on. Pick it up.

116
00:15:32.348 --> 00:15:33.391
Hurry up!

117
00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:36.227
The hallway's secure.
Move up to the next floor.

118
00:15:46.863 --> 00:15:48.948
You should be locked up
with the others.

119
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:08.259
Oh. damn. Well. that usually works.

120
00:17:13.199 --> 00:17:15.826
Someone needs to teach you your place.

121
00:17:17.203 --> 00:17:18.621
I've heard that before.

122
00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:29.924
Get off me!

123
00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:07.670
I want to be a great warrior.
Like you were. Linh.

124
00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:12.300
A true warrior is defined
not by how she fights…

125
00:18:12.383 --> 00:18:14.343
Through calm. find your center.

126
00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:17.346
…but by what she is fighting for.

127
00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:21.434
What on earth are you two doing?

128
00:18:22.226 --> 00:18:23.686
Your Majesty.

129
00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:25.813
You're supposed to be learning etiquette.

130
00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:28.065
Listen.

131
00:18:28.649 --> 00:18:31.777
with any luck. soon I will
give the kingdom the son it needs.

132
00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:33.904
But your education and your training

133
00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:36.824
are no less crucial
to our family's future.

134
00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:40.786
If I might. Your Majesty.
She is a very smart girl.

135
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:42.788
She can learn many things at once.

136
00:18:44.498 --> 00:18:47.043
In future.
keep it out of view of the palace.

137
00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:48.919
The king will not approve.

138
00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:22.161
He washed up over there.
He must have fallen from the tower.

139
00:19:24.246 --> 00:19:25.247
Fallen?

140
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.919
Look at the bruises. They tell the story.

141
00:19:32.171 --> 00:19:33.422
This man didn't fall.

142
00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:36.759
Everything else is proceeding
just as my lord planned.

143
00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:38.427
The tower is ours.

144
00:19:38.511 --> 00:19:41.514
The princess is dressed
and ready for the wedding.

145
00:19:41.597 --> 00:19:43.766
Has someone checked
that she's safe and secure?

146
00:19:43.849 --> 00:19:45.726
She's locked in. Chained.

147
00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.228
Is that what I asked. Kurr?

148
00:19:49.939 --> 00:19:54.151
If there is some vigilante on the loose.
you take care of it.

149
00:19:54.819 --> 00:19:58.155
Otherwise.
your position is in serious jeopardy.

150
00:19:58.239 --> 00:19:59.407
-Do you understand?
-Yes. sir.

151
00:19:59.490 --> 00:20:00.950
-Do you understand?
-Yes. sir!

152
00:20:02.368 --> 00:20:03.369
Good.

153
00:20:14.255 --> 00:20:15.423
You. Come here!

154
00:20:20.344 --> 00:20:23.139
To the top of the tower.
Check on the princess.

155
00:20:27.977 --> 00:20:30.396
Yes. Up there. Go!

156
00:20:35.276 --> 00:20:36.277
Warm in here.

157
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.320
-Gold. Look.
-Where?

158
00:20:38.404 --> 00:20:40.030
-Women.
-Women's gold?

159
00:20:40.114 --> 00:20:41.115
No.

160
00:21:16.192 --> 00:21:19.737
-What are you doing now?
-What's that? Quickly!

161
00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:21.697
You two. search those doors.

162
00:21:21.781 --> 00:21:24.533
-You. with me.
-Come on. then. boy. let's go.

163
00:21:24.617 --> 00:21:26.619
Come on. Hurry up. Through here.

164
00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:31.665
Come on. Must be some bounty in here.

165
00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:38.214
I can't believe she stabbed me!

166
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.302
Oh. I like a girl in lace.

167
00:22:03.239 --> 00:22:05.825
-What has Julius done with my family?
-Fuck off.

168
00:22:05.908 --> 00:22:08.369
Do you even know how to use this thing?

169
00:22:13.999 --> 00:22:15.209
Watch your language.

170
00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:17.503
You're in the presence of a princess.

171
00:22:19.463 --> 00:22:22.216
-Where are they?
-I'm not telling you anything. you bitch.

172
00:22:29.056 --> 00:22:30.349
Don't make me ask again.

173
00:22:30.432 --> 00:22:33.769
You're never getting out of here alive.
you cu--

174
00:22:37.982 --> 00:22:39.859
I warned you about that mouth.

175
00:22:55.916 --> 00:22:58.878
-Ooh. nice.
-Thank you very much.

176
00:22:58.961 --> 00:23:01.380
There's plenty more in here!

177
00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:03.549
Let's take it all. boys!

178
00:23:06.135 --> 00:23:08.053
-Move!
-Out of the way. you big tub of lard.

179
00:23:08.137 --> 00:23:10.055
Come on. then. Go through here.

180
00:23:10.139 --> 00:23:11.891
-I like the look of that!

181
00:23:11.974 --> 00:23:13.100
Get your hands off!

182
00:23:13.183 --> 00:23:15.394
-Let's go!
-I'm coming!

183
00:24:05.527 --> 00:24:06.695
Come on.

184
00:24:08.614 --> 00:24:09.990
Oh. God. Hurry up.

185
00:24:46.819 --> 00:24:48.904
-Search!
-Come on! Quickly!

186
00:24:48.988 --> 00:24:50.781
No bag to put it in.

187
00:24:51.699 --> 00:24:53.742
-Hey. what you doin' over there?
-What?

188
00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:55.285
The order is to search this way.

189
00:24:55.369 --> 00:24:56.578
Oh. yeah. all right.

190
00:24:57.079 --> 00:24:59.581
Come on! Go! Look everywhere.

191
00:25:04.086 --> 00:25:07.423
Anything that's shiny.
Anything we can sell down the village.

192
00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:10.926
Look. look. look. That. there.
Nice. Nice. Anything like that.

193
00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:30.988
-Get your hands off!

194
00:25:41.915 --> 00:25:43.751
We'll be rich with all this.

195
00:25:46.754 --> 00:25:48.130
-Come on!
-That's mine!

196
00:25:48.213 --> 00:25:50.924
-No. give it to me!
-Come on. boys.

197
00:25:53.761 --> 00:25:55.137
-Give me that!
-Get off it.

198
00:25:56.138 --> 00:25:58.849
All right. all right. Calm down.
Load it up now. boy.

199
00:25:58.932 --> 00:26:01.727
Hang on. Who put this clown in charge?

200
00:26:04.521 --> 00:26:06.023
-Give me some of that.
-No.

201
00:26:06.106 --> 00:26:07.858
I want it. Give me some of that.

202
00:26:07.941 --> 00:26:10.652
No. not again.
This happens every time. No.

203
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:16.992
Come on. then.
Where's this food? I'm hungry.

204
00:26:17.076 --> 00:26:19.244
We've got some wine. What do you reckon?

205
00:26:19.328 --> 00:26:22.247
Yeah. Look at the pearls on that.
Bet that's worth…

206
00:26:22.331 --> 00:26:23.874
-There you go. Share it.
-Yeah.

207
00:26:23.957 --> 00:26:24.958
No. that's mine.

208
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.877
Hey. Gibsy. what you got there. then?

209
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.421
-Don't hog all of it. you fat bastard.

210
00:26:29.505 --> 00:26:32.466
This meat is mine.
You wanna eat? Get your own food.

211
00:26:36.053 --> 00:26:37.888
Move quickly then. boys.

212
00:26:37.971 --> 00:26:39.890
Julius can't get wind of this.

213
00:26:39.973 --> 00:26:41.850
Come on. Chop-chop.

214
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:46.396
Sh-- All right. Whatever you got.

215
00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.481
-Yeah.
-Come on.

216
00:26:47.564 --> 00:26:50.234
-What's all that rubbish you got?
-Just shut up. Come on.

217
00:26:50.317 --> 00:26:52.152
-What?
-Keep your voice down.

218
00:27:45.164 --> 00:27:46.582
Where's your center? Hmm?

219
00:27:50.711 --> 00:27:53.130
No focus. no speed. Again.

220
00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:00.304
What did I tell you?

221
00:28:02.598 --> 00:28:04.474
You're not fighting from your heart.

222
00:28:04.558 --> 00:28:05.684
Try it again.

223
00:28:11.732 --> 00:28:13.775
What is he doing here?

224
00:28:13.859 --> 00:28:16.486
You know Khai
as one of the king's advisers.

225
00:28:17.196 --> 00:28:18.322
He's also my uncle

226
00:28:19.072 --> 00:28:21.909
and the warrior who trained me
once upon a time.

227
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.958
Today. you're gonna fight us both.

228
00:28:30.959 --> 00:28:32.085
Both?

229
00:28:54.733 --> 00:28:56.151
You're not fighting from your heart.

230
00:28:56.235 --> 00:28:57.527
No focus. no speed.

231
00:28:57.611 --> 00:28:59.363
Patience and focus.

232
00:29:20.092 --> 00:29:21.260
You were right.

233
00:29:21.969 --> 00:29:23.470
She has a warrior's heart.

234
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:27.641
I cannot accept such a gift.

235
00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:32.396
I would only entrust it
to the hands of a true warrior.

236
00:29:44.157 --> 00:29:48.245
I would only entrust it
to the hands of a true warrior.

237
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.522
How are the preparations
for the wedding coming?

238
00:30:15.605 --> 00:30:16.815
Good. sir.

239
00:30:16.898 --> 00:30:18.442
Is everything exactly as it was?

240
00:30:18.525 --> 00:30:22.446
The flowers. candles. ribbons?
The priests?

241
00:30:22.529 --> 00:30:24.531
Is everything as it was that evening?

242
00:30:25.115 --> 00:30:26.616
We'll get it done. sir.

243
00:30:31.163 --> 00:30:32.789
…grateful salutes…

244
00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:37.002
of my new subjects…

245
00:30:39.796 --> 00:30:43.717
we can finally purge this kingdom
of its weakness.

246
00:30:48.055 --> 00:30:50.766
Then why not take the throne by force?

247
00:30:52.476 --> 00:30:54.936
You can get what you want without her.

248
00:30:57.064 --> 00:30:59.191
You're a valued consort of mine.

249
00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:01.943
but politics?

250
00:31:03.028 --> 00:31:04.112
Please.

251
00:31:07.282 --> 00:31:10.243
There's a reason
why traditions last centuries.

252
00:31:11.161 --> 00:31:12.746
People love tradition.

253
00:31:17.834 --> 00:31:19.753
With her hand in mine.

254
00:31:19.836 --> 00:31:22.923
there is not a soul that can question
that I'm the rightful king!

255
00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:27.469
I only meant that last night
was a spectacular show of power.

256
00:31:27.552 --> 00:31:28.970
-Yes.
-Mmm.

257
00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:31.765
-They were terrified. weren't they?

258
00:31:31.848 --> 00:31:34.935
So… indignant.

259
00:31:35.477 --> 00:31:38.271
Violence wakes people up.

260
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:45.070
And people will be even more terrified

261
00:31:45.153 --> 00:31:48.990
after the coronation
when I slit the king's throat.

262
00:31:50.283 --> 00:31:53.328
You are such a clever man.

263
00:31:55.997 --> 00:31:59.501
I know you need to save your strength
for that limp rag of a bride.

264
00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:45.130
Yes?

265
00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:47.966
What is it?

266
00:32:48.592 --> 00:32:50.010
I'm sorry. sir.

267
00:32:50.093 --> 00:32:52.512
-The king is asking for you.
-Oh. the king?

268
00:32:53.305 --> 00:32:54.306
The "king."

269
00:32:57.767 --> 00:32:59.186
Well. this will be interesting.

270
00:33:39.976 --> 00:33:41.895
Juli… …us.

271
00:33:42.604 --> 00:33:44.689
is the pri-- the prince--

272
00:33:47.025 --> 00:33:49.069
Is she th--

273
00:33:52.197 --> 00:33:53.281
She--

274
00:34:36.825 --> 00:34:38.493
You seek the crown.

275
00:34:39.077 --> 00:34:42.539
It can only hurt you in the eyes
of the very people you wish to rule.

276
00:34:42.622 --> 00:34:45.000
And how do you think you stand
in the eyes of the people now?

277
00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:46.668
Julius. this assault…

278
00:34:46.751 --> 00:34:48.753
You made a promise to me.

279
00:34:49.379 --> 00:34:52.090
A promise you recanted
on the whim of a girl.

280
00:35:51.191 --> 00:35:52.984
Who else do you take orders from?

281
00:35:53.568 --> 00:35:54.944
Servants?

282
00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:57.072
Dogs?

283
00:36:00.617 --> 00:36:02.869
Who exactly holds the power
in this kingdom?

284
00:36:31.815 --> 00:36:33.775
We both do. You and I.

285
00:36:34.317 --> 00:36:36.695
Julius.
let us find the solution to this together.

286
00:36:37.445 --> 00:36:39.447
Treason will only lead to more bloodshed.

287
00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.161
A wedding is not an act of treason.

288
00:36:48.164 --> 00:36:49.374
Take him away.

289
00:37:16.484 --> 00:37:17.861
Huh?

290
00:37:28.204 --> 00:37:29.497
The princess?

291
00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:31.124
She's in the tower.

292
00:37:31.207 --> 00:37:32.459
Are you sure?

293
00:37:33.918 --> 00:37:37.797
-Bloody hell. What's going on?
-Bloody hell did he come from?

294
00:37:51.978 --> 00:37:55.398
Deal with this now.

295
00:38:09.287 --> 00:38:10.663
Clear the tower again.

296
00:38:11.164 --> 00:38:14.083
Take it floor by floor.

297
00:38:14.167 --> 00:38:15.960
-Move! Let's go!
-Go! Come on! Move it!

298
00:38:16.044 --> 00:38:17.045
Wait!

299
00:38:18.004 --> 00:38:19.088
You.

300
00:38:19.923 --> 00:38:23.218
Hey. We heard what he has to say.

301
00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:27.722
You saw no sign of this man
on your way up or down?

302
00:38:27.806 --> 00:38:28.932
No.

303
00:38:30.350 --> 00:38:32.685
We're dealing with someone
who knows this place well.

304
00:38:32.769 --> 00:38:34.270
The lord's left.

305
00:38:35.355 --> 00:38:38.316
No one has to pretend
to listen to you now.

306
00:38:38.942 --> 00:38:40.610
Useless harlot.

307
00:39:14.978 --> 00:39:17.021
Not so useless now. am I?

308
00:39:26.865 --> 00:39:28.992
I want this vigilante killed.

309
00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:30.910
Consider no chamber clear.

310
00:39:31.536 --> 00:39:32.620
Go!

311
00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:51.764
Look. she's down there!

312
00:39:55.602 --> 00:39:57.270
Don't you move. girl!

313
00:40:00.106 --> 00:40:01.858
Come on! Hurry up!

314
00:40:08.406 --> 00:40:09.741
Where you going. huh?

315
00:40:26.591 --> 00:40:28.301
You're coming with us.

316
00:40:34.015 --> 00:40:35.475
Get after her!

317
00:40:36.935 --> 00:40:37.936
Let's get her. boys!

318
00:40:39.729 --> 00:40:40.813
Get back here!

319
00:40:50.573 --> 00:40:51.699
Get off me!

320
00:40:56.621 --> 00:40:57.747
Oh. God.

321
00:41:07.882 --> 00:41:09.801
Come on. boys!

322
00:41:12.387 --> 00:41:14.889
We've got you now. girl.

323
00:41:45.753 --> 00:41:47.463
Come on! Get up. Get her!

324
00:42:10.486 --> 00:42:11.487
My leg!

325
00:42:28.129 --> 00:42:29.255
Come here. you--

326
00:42:33.134 --> 00:42:34.302
Get up!

327
00:42:54.947 --> 00:42:56.157
Go on. get her!

328
00:43:03.664 --> 00:43:04.707
Come on!

329
00:43:27.063 --> 00:43:30.149
-No.

330
00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:48.584
Come on! Catch her!

331
00:43:50.628 --> 00:43:52.672
My leg!

332
00:43:52.755 --> 00:43:54.590
Stand back! We need her alive!

333
00:43:54.674 --> 00:43:56.509
Get me down from here!

334
00:43:57.802 --> 00:43:59.929
You! You! You let me go!

335
00:44:00.012 --> 00:44:00.930
Shut up!

336
00:44:03.641 --> 00:44:05.184
She's off her nut!

337
00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:39.111
Oh. you--

338
00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:03.386
Come on! Don't let her escape!

339
00:46:08.307 --> 00:46:09.517
Quickly!

340
00:46:10.434 --> 00:46:11.852
You're surrounded!

341
00:46:12.728 --> 00:46:14.105
Come on!

342
00:46:28.035 --> 00:46:29.787
Just move. will you!

343
00:47:32.975 --> 00:47:35.019
He is an ideal candidate.

344
00:47:35.102 --> 00:47:37.188
a respected lord
who will restore our standing

345
00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:38.731
in the eyes of those who doubt us.

346
00:47:38.814 --> 00:47:40.775
She's barely met him since she was a girl.

347
00:47:40.858 --> 00:47:42.860
I understand
this does not sit well with you.

348
00:47:42.943 --> 00:47:45.529
But this decision
has to be made strategically.

349
00:47:45.613 --> 00:47:47.156
We have no son.

350
00:47:50.743 --> 00:47:52.078
No heir.

351
00:47:52.661 --> 00:47:54.955
We should arrange the wedding
as quickly as we can.

352
00:47:56.248 --> 00:47:57.458
What else can we do?

353
00:47:58.334 --> 00:47:59.835
I have a solution.

354
00:48:05.007 --> 00:48:06.300
What is this?

355
00:48:06.384 --> 00:48:08.052
I know of your plans for me.

356
00:48:08.135 --> 00:48:12.014
And I beg of you.
let me train as a knight instead.

357
00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.975
I'm afraid you have me to blame for this.

358
00:48:15.059 --> 00:48:16.644
You condone this?

359
00:48:21.690 --> 00:48:23.275
I never wish to see you this way again.

360
00:48:23.359 --> 00:48:24.819
Father.
if you would just let me show you--

361
00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:26.278
Enough.

362
00:48:30.157 --> 00:48:32.451
You are old enough now to understand.

363
00:48:32.952 --> 00:48:34.578
This kingdom has no heir.

364
00:48:35.663 --> 00:48:38.165
We are all vulnerable.
every last one of us.

365
00:48:38.249 --> 00:48:39.750
until a successor is in place.

366
00:48:39.834 --> 00:48:42.378
-But I can be the successor.
-You're my child.

367
00:48:46.674 --> 00:48:51.303
You did not honestly think
that I would send you off to die.

368
00:48:51.387 --> 00:48:54.390
or worse. at the hands of some barbarian.

369
00:48:54.473 --> 00:48:57.476
But you'll sell me into the bedroom
of a man I barely know.

370
00:48:58.686 --> 00:49:01.230
He is an honorable lord of good family.

371
00:49:01.313 --> 00:49:03.816
I'm not a piece of property to be traded.

372
00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:10.614
I credited you with more maturity
than I should have.

373
00:49:11.365 --> 00:49:12.575
Now I see

374
00:49:12.658 --> 00:49:16.537
that you are just an impetuous girl
who only thinks about herself.

375
00:49:19.498 --> 00:49:21.542
This kingdom is relying on you.

376
00:49:24.128 --> 00:49:26.505
You will find it in yourself
to do your duty.

377
00:50:00.247 --> 00:50:01.790
-Linh.
-Princess.

378
00:50:06.837 --> 00:50:08.297
What are you doing here?

379
00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.090
I was making my way to you.

380
00:50:13.844 --> 00:50:15.054
I'm glad you're here.

381
00:50:16.764 --> 00:50:18.724
I have something for these wounds.

382
00:50:21.393 --> 00:50:22.394
Come.

383
00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:24.855
Sit here.

384
00:50:29.485 --> 00:50:30.569
My family.

385
00:50:31.111 --> 00:50:32.112
I know.

386
00:50:34.031 --> 00:50:36.992
Mother always said that pain is beauty.

387
00:50:37.076 --> 00:50:39.703
I think she was talking about corsets.

388
00:50:44.375 --> 00:50:45.793
This will help.

389
00:50:49.338 --> 00:50:50.548
What happened. Linh?

390
00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:52.925
He came in the night.

391
00:50:53.509 --> 00:50:55.010
No one was prepared.

392
00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:59.682
The king's guards were overrun.

393
00:51:02.101 --> 00:51:03.769
Julius showed no mercy.

394
00:51:06.313 --> 00:51:09.775
I managed to escape and hide.
but was one of the few.

395
00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.820
He was ruthless.

396
00:51:18.367 --> 00:51:19.618
It's all my fault.

397
00:51:24.039 --> 00:51:25.332
Princess.

398
00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:29.295
that kind of thinking right now
won't help.

399
00:51:35.467 --> 00:51:37.136
I have to save them. Linh.

400
00:51:39.054 --> 00:51:40.222
We will.

401
00:51:40.806 --> 00:51:42.141
They're in the keep.

402
00:51:43.434 --> 00:51:45.519
There's only one unguarded way in.

403
00:51:46.729 --> 00:51:49.398
There's more rooms up here. lads.
Come on.

404
00:51:49.481 --> 00:51:51.525
We need to find a way to the sewers.

405
00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:54.737
But we have to pass
through the kitchen. Okay?

406
00:51:57.364 --> 00:51:59.283
Go on. then. You hungry?

407
00:51:59.366 --> 00:52:00.784
Out of the way. Move!

408
00:52:00.868 --> 00:52:02.202
Don't make me cut you.

409
00:52:12.546 --> 00:52:13.672
Oh. God.

410
00:52:14.673 --> 00:52:16.675
Hey. yeah.

411
00:52:24.224 --> 00:52:26.935
You think I'm gonna let you have
all the fun for yourself?

412
00:52:30.397 --> 00:52:31.649
Just remember.

413
00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:34.526
patience and focus.

414
00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:36.904
Okay.

415
00:52:40.699 --> 00:52:42.117
Come on. Let's go.

416
00:52:42.993 --> 00:52:44.745
We gotta find the princess.

417
00:52:45.537 --> 00:52:46.538
Come on.

418
00:52:48.374 --> 00:52:49.958
-Yeah!
-Come on.

419
00:52:50.751 --> 00:52:52.336
-Yes.

420
00:52:52.419 --> 00:52:53.504
Let's take that off.

421
00:52:54.171 --> 00:52:56.715
-You wanna come with me tonight?
-Psst.

422
00:52:56.799 --> 00:52:58.050
Ooh. tasty.

423
00:52:58.133 --> 00:53:01.011
-Get that off!
-No!

424
00:53:01.095 --> 00:53:03.847
-Come on. come on!
-Come here. love.

425
00:53:03.931 --> 00:53:06.392
Oh. yeah. Do you like my hand there?

426
00:53:06.475 --> 00:53:07.726
She loves it.

427
00:53:09.061 --> 00:53:11.897
-Don't touch me. No!
-Yes.

428
00:53:13.232 --> 00:53:14.233
Don't touch me!

429
00:53:14.316 --> 00:53:17.653
Hey. we ain't gonna hurt you… much.

430
00:53:21.323 --> 00:53:22.783
-Now. now.
-Yeah.

431
00:53:23.909 --> 00:53:27.329
-Oi! Where's my supper?
-Keep your voice down.

432
00:53:27.413 --> 00:53:28.580
What's happened to the cook?

433
00:53:28.664 --> 00:53:30.082
-Yes.
-Who are you?

434
00:53:30.916 --> 00:53:32.334
I'm the princess.

435
00:53:37.715 --> 00:53:38.799
And that's Linh.

436
00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:43.429
Nice to meet you.

437
00:53:44.346 --> 00:53:46.640
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. I'm okay.

438
00:53:47.141 --> 00:53:48.225
Thank you.

439
00:53:52.771 --> 00:53:53.856
It's her.

440
00:53:54.815 --> 00:53:56.775
Sweet little princess.

441
00:54:09.204 --> 00:54:10.831
Here. you hungry. love?

442
00:54:39.276 --> 00:54:40.903
Well. go on. then!

443
00:54:49.703 --> 00:54:50.829
Come on.

444
00:55:22.027 --> 00:55:24.488
All you had to do was accept a ring.

445
00:55:25.948 --> 00:55:27.366
Instead. you made a mess.

446
00:55:29.201 --> 00:55:31.119
Why go through all this trouble?

447
00:55:31.787 --> 00:55:34.498
Be the weak little person
you were meant to be.

448
00:55:38.126 --> 00:55:39.461
Let's find out.

449
00:56:08.782 --> 00:56:10.325
Linh.

450
00:56:20.961 --> 00:56:22.004
Princess!

451
00:57:01.376 --> 00:57:02.836
Princess. you go. I'm gonna stop her.

452
00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:05.631
-I'm not leaving without you.
-Your family needs you.

453
00:57:05.714 --> 00:57:07.633
You have to leave now
before it's too late.

454
00:57:07.716 --> 00:57:09.843
-Linh. no.
-Princess. trust me.

455
00:57:09.927 --> 00:57:10.886
Go now. Go!

456
00:58:17.619 --> 00:58:19.538
-All right. You ready. boys?
-Oh. yeah.

457
00:58:21.039 --> 00:58:22.124
My last coin.

458
00:58:22.624 --> 00:58:25.627
-I spent my money at the tower.

459
00:58:25.711 --> 00:58:29.089
Yeah. you wanna get down to the brothel.
They let you drink for free.

460
00:58:29.172 --> 00:58:32.426
Oh. yeah? I wonder why that is.

461
00:58:34.011 --> 00:58:36.471
No drink. no win.

462
00:58:37.139 --> 00:58:38.348
Right. hit me.

463
00:58:38.432 --> 00:58:40.308
Go on. then. Hurry up.

464
00:58:43.770 --> 00:58:44.855
What--

465
00:59:12.674 --> 00:59:13.675
I needed that.

466
00:59:17.095 --> 00:59:18.013
Enough.

467
00:59:21.892 --> 00:59:22.893
Come on!

468
00:59:55.634 --> 00:59:56.927
I knew it.

469
00:59:58.053 --> 00:59:59.179
Well. then.

470
01:00:00.388 --> 01:00:01.681
Shall we?

471
01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:06.478
Violet.

472
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:09.064
We have to go. Okay.

473
01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:10.899
Stay close.

474
01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:12.984
Stay close to me.

475
01:00:18.657 --> 01:00:19.783
Come on. come.

476
01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:14.504
Look at the mess you've made.

477
01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:18.967
Not exactly the ladylike behavior
I'd expect of you.

478
01:01:21.261 --> 01:01:22.554
But that will change.

479
01:01:29.895 --> 01:01:32.063
-Leave my sister alone!
-Violet. no.

480
01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:36.067
Have we not talked about your manners?

481
01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:39.404
You're an oddity.

482
01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:43.074
What on earth happened
to make you end up this way?

483
01:01:43.158 --> 01:01:44.576
I was born this way.

484
01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:46.953
No. you were born to be my wife.

485
01:01:49.831 --> 01:01:51.374
I look forward to it.

486
01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:56.421
Oh. you do?

487
01:01:57.964 --> 01:01:59.174
At your side.

488
01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:01.468
Every day.

489
01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.556
At your service every night.

490
01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:11.144
It's like something out of a fairy tale…

491
01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:13.563
for me.

492
01:02:15.523 --> 01:02:16.650
And for me?

493
01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:22.989
A nightmare.

494
01:02:27.118 --> 01:02:29.788
You'll learn to sleep with one eye open.

495
01:02:31.539 --> 01:02:33.708
To never turn your back.

496
01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:36.086
I'll be in heaven.

497
01:02:36.878 --> 01:02:40.590
just thinking day and night

498
01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:42.217
of ways to kill you.

499
01:02:43.885 --> 01:02:45.053
And you'll be in hell…

500
01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:50.100
wondering when it's coming.

501
01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:54.145
And you know that it will be coming.

502
01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.943
Because you know that I'll never rest.

503
01:03:01.611 --> 01:03:04.239
never idle. never stop.

504
01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:09.035
until I am standing above your corpse.

505
01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:14.958
holding. in my delicate. manicured hands.

506
01:03:16.209 --> 01:03:19.045
your still-beating heart.

507
01:03:31.057 --> 01:03:33.518
Well. it seems the princess
is still unwilling.

508
01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:41.151
If only there were another option.

509
01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:51.119
No.

510
01:03:55.623 --> 01:03:58.710
You look as though you won't be
nearly as much trouble as your sister.

511
01:03:59.919 --> 01:04:01.588
Julius. you wouldn't.

512
01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:02.756
Wouldn't I?

513
01:04:09.637 --> 01:04:10.638
Kill the princess.

514
01:04:10.722 --> 01:04:11.598
No!

515
01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.141
-No. stop!
-Julius. please!

516
01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:20.982
Get back here!

517
01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:30.200
No!

518
01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:57.477
And always remember. Princess.

519
01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:00.188
the real power is not from your blade.

520
01:05:01.189 --> 01:05:02.482
but from your heart.

521
01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:04.359
What is this?

522
01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:06.319
I am strong. I can fight.

523
01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:07.529
You're my child.

524
01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.489
I never wish to see you this way again.

525
01:05:09.572 --> 01:05:13.034
-When I slit the king's throat.
-I have to save them. Linh.

526
01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:15.745
-Julius. you wouldn't.
-Wouldn't I?

527
01:05:29.175 --> 01:05:33.680
A true warrior is defined
not by how she fights.

528
01:05:33.763 --> 01:05:37.016
but by what she is fighting for.

529
01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:13.970
-Come on. boys.
-Come on.

530
01:06:16.014 --> 01:06:17.974
You. There.

531
01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:19.976
Stand in the middle as before.

532
01:06:21.019 --> 01:06:22.729
Bring in the rest of our guests.

533
01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:25.482
And where is Violet? Find her now.

534
01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:28.693
Find the girl!

535
01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:30.278
Come on. move!

536
01:06:30.361 --> 01:06:33.281
-You. that way. In there.
-Quickly!

537
01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:52.926
Oi! Get up.

538
01:06:53.551 --> 01:06:55.470
Come with me. Get up.

539
01:07:18.493 --> 01:07:19.744
Did I help?

540
01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:23.623
-Good job.
-Oh. yes!

541
01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:26.918
Oh. thank you. Violet. Yeah.

542
01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:31.339
Princess. You survived.

543
01:07:38.012 --> 01:07:39.639
It seems so childish now.

544
01:07:40.807 --> 01:07:43.434
Me telling you
that I wanted to be a warrior.

545
01:07:46.521 --> 01:07:48.189
If I had just done my duty--

546
01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:50.191
No. Princess. No.

547
01:07:50.775 --> 01:07:53.861
Julius would be the same monster
no matter what you did.

548
01:07:57.907 --> 01:08:00.702
You have to stop him.

549
01:08:09.043 --> 01:08:10.670
Come with us. Come on.

550
01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:13.631
Linh. you go first.

551
01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:23.683
This is one of our storehouses.
in the event of a siege.

552
01:08:50.543 --> 01:08:53.296
-Let's get you ready.
-Yes.

553
01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:56.382
-Look everywhere. Come on!
-Come on! Find that child!

554
01:08:57.175 --> 01:08:59.010
Quickly! Find the child!

555
01:09:08.394 --> 01:09:12.023
Little Violet can't hide forever.
We will find her.

556
01:09:12.607 --> 01:09:15.360
Check in there! Get a move on!

557
01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:00.196
What do you think?

558
01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.200
I want to fight too.

559
01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:08.496
You know.

560
01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:14.168
I once knew a princess that said
the exact same thing at your age.

561
01:10:14.252 --> 01:10:16.629
But you got to do it.

562
01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:22.885
And you will too.
I will see to it myself. I promise.

563
01:10:24.262 --> 01:10:25.430
But until then…

564
01:10:27.056 --> 01:10:29.308
Hidden. Quiet. Alive.

565
01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:31.352
Yes. That's my girl.

566
01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.231
I love you.

567
01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:41.237
Stay safe.

568
01:10:58.588 --> 01:11:01.215
Well. now we're all here.

569
01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:04.886
Call for Violet.

570
01:11:05.636 --> 01:11:07.013
She'll come to you.

571
01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:10.641
I'll cut out my tongue first.

572
01:11:11.559 --> 01:11:14.645
Yes. it may come to that.

573
01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:25.364
Come on!

574
01:11:44.592 --> 01:11:48.262
She refuses death. time and time again.

575
01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:51.808
Not for much longer.

576
01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:05.822
-Come on. Move!
-Come on! Let's go!

577
01:12:38.521 --> 01:12:39.522
Go on!

578
01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:43.192
Hyah!

579
01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.869
We've got to find a way in!

580
01:13:13.931 --> 01:13:15.349
Stay where you are!

581
01:13:17.894 --> 01:13:19.937
Keep them under control outside.

582
01:13:20.021 --> 01:13:23.065
And make sure it is done properly
this time. you understand?

583
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:24.692
Yes. milord. Come on.

584
01:13:44.921 --> 01:13:46.964
Aim at the joints. Trust me.

585
01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:04.941
-Gotcha!

586
01:14:13.032 --> 01:14:14.158
Come here!

587
01:14:15.034 --> 01:14:16.494
-Get up.
-Violet!

588
01:14:18.496 --> 01:14:20.665
-Julius!
-Your eldest daughter…

589
01:14:20.748 --> 01:14:24.460
-I'll kill you. Get away from me!
-…is about to become a corpse.

590
01:14:25.252 --> 01:14:27.922
-And as for the little one…

591
01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:29.090
Kneel.

592
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:31.926
Marry us.

593
01:14:32.677 --> 01:14:35.388
We have to get in there. Let's split up.

594
01:14:40.685 --> 01:14:41.936
Come on then!

595
01:15:04.375 --> 01:15:05.292
Go on.

596
01:15:37.575 --> 01:15:38.617
Take her!

597
01:15:55.051 --> 01:15:56.135
Now!

598
01:16:13.319 --> 01:16:15.071
I underestimated you.

599
01:16:15.696 --> 01:16:17.990
That's okay. I'm used to that.

600
01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:34.423
Linh.

601
01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:09.625
-No. don't!

602
01:17:11.377 --> 01:17:12.920
Julius. please!

603
01:17:15.089 --> 01:17:16.924
Go! Move. move. move!

604
01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:21.470
-Come.
-Linh!

605
01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:28.310
That sword doesn't belong to you.

606
01:18:39.590 --> 01:18:40.841
Linh!

607
01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:52.186
Linh!

608
01:18:52.269 --> 01:18:54.480
No! No!

609
01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:00.194
No!

610
01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:05.282
No.

611
01:19:57.960 --> 01:19:58.961
Get to safety.

612
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:07.011
It looks like you got me
to the altar after all.

613
01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:08.804
Yes.

614
01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:11.432
I told you I would.

615
01:20:12.599 --> 01:20:13.684
didn't I?

616
01:20:22.443 --> 01:20:23.527
Hyah!

617
01:20:37.207 --> 01:20:39.793
Your parents wept the day you were born.

618
01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:41.462
I was there.

619
01:20:42.588 --> 01:20:45.549
They were so upset that you weren't a man.

620
01:20:47.551 --> 01:20:48.886
Well. I heard…

621
01:20:50.846 --> 01:20:52.598
yours wept for the same reason.

622
01:21:00.731 --> 01:21:01.815
Yeah.

623
01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:25.047
I was going to make
your little sister's life

624
01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:28.342
much. much easier…

625
01:21:30.844 --> 01:21:33.680
until you started behaving like this.

626
01:22:05.087 --> 01:22:06.213
Here she is.

627
01:22:07.548 --> 01:22:09.758
Your pretty princess.

628
01:22:11.885 --> 01:22:15.556
Kneeling before the new king.

629
01:22:17.391 --> 01:22:21.186
A reminder to you all
that I won't be belittled.

630
01:22:21.937 --> 01:22:23.397
I won't be forsaken

631
01:22:24.565 --> 01:22:26.817
in this weak and feeble kingdom.

632
01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:30.654
That power is required on the throne.

633
01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:39.997
I will be that power.

634
01:22:41.248 --> 01:22:44.710
I will rule with aggression
like no one else before!

635
01:22:47.629 --> 01:22:48.714
Patience…

636
01:22:49.882 --> 01:22:53.594
A reminder to you people.

637
01:22:55.345 --> 01:22:58.390
-I will never. ever…

638
01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:03.270
…have taken from me
what is rightfully mine.

639
01:23:05.105 --> 01:23:06.231
…and focus.

640
01:23:07.357 --> 01:23:08.734
It was never yours.

641
01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:26.603
The kingdom is ours again.

642
01:24:44.663 --> 01:24:46.873
Ring the chapel bells until midnight

643
01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:49.293
because today.

644
01:24:50.460 --> 01:24:52.421
an heir to the kingdom was born.

645
01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:24.995
Henceforth.

646
01:25:25.996 --> 01:25:28.498
the daughters of this kingdom
make their own fate.

647
01:25:29.750 --> 01:25:31.585
just as my daughter has done today.

648
01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:37.341
I have never been more proud.

649
01:25:39.051 --> 01:25:41.637
We are. all of us. in your debt.

650
01:25:42.387 --> 01:25:43.722
I was wrong.

651
01:25:44.222 --> 01:25:45.641
I should have trusted you.

652
01:25:48.644 --> 01:25:49.770
Forgive me.

653
01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:57.110
Now. rise.

654
01:26:02.616 --> 01:26:05.577
And let the people see
their future leader for who she is.

655
01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:31.103
Linh?

656
01:26:31.186 --> 01:26:32.396
-Linh.
-Princess.

657
01:26:32.479 --> 01:26:34.189
You're alive.

658
01:26:35.065 --> 01:26:36.191
You're alive.

659
01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:46.868
Princess.

660
01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.044
You did it.

661
01:26:56.962 --> 01:26:58.213
You did it.

662
01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:25.782
There she is!
